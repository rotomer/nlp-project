ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
a) Purchase Agreement.
     On June 23, 2005, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company ("Goodyear" or the "Company") completed an offering (the "Offering") of $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 9.00% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Notes") in a transaction under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the Offering, Goodyear entered into a purchase agreement, dated as of June 20, 2005 (the "Purchase Agreement"), with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Calyon Securities (USA) Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., Natexis Bleichroeder Inc. and KBC Financial Products USA, Inc., as initial purchasers of the Notes (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"). The Notes are guaranteed by Goodyear's U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee Goodyear's obligations under its senior secured credit facilities.
     Goodyear intends to use the proceeds from the Offering of approximately $390 million (after deduction of the Initial Purchasers' 2.25% discount and payment of offering expenses) to repay the $200 million in borrowings under the Company's U.S. first lien revolving credit facility, and to replace $190 million of cash that the Company used to pay $516 million principal amount of its 6.375% Euro Notes due 2005 at maturity on June 6, 2005. The Company may then use the $190 million in cash to repay other debt obligations and for general corporate purposes.
     In the Purchase Agreement, Goodyear agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities in connection with the Offering or contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
     In the ordinary course of business, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial banking, cash management, foreign exchange or other financial services to Goodyear and its affiliates for which they have received customary compensation and may receive customary compensation in the future. Affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers are lenders under certain of the Company's credit facilities, including its U.S. first lien revolving credit facility. The Company intends to repay its borrowings under the U.S. first lien revolving credit facility with the net proceeds of the Offering.
     The offering and sale of the Notes were not registered under the Securities Act, and the Notes may not be reoffered or resold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
     A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The descriptions of the material terms of the Purchase Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibit.

(b) Indenture and Notes.
     The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of June 23, 2005 (the "Indenture"), between Goodyear and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Indenture and form of initial note and exchange note, which are attached as exhibits to the Indenture, provide, among other things, that the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Goodyear and will rank equally with all of the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Interest is payable on the Notes on January 1 and July 1 of each year beginning on January 1, 2006 until the maturity date of July 1, 2015. Prior to July 1, 2010, Goodyear may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus an applicable premium and accrued but unpaid interest. After July 1, 2010, Goodyear may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Notes at redemption prices set forth in the Indenture. In addition, at any time prior to July 1, 2008, Goodyear may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture.
     The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit the ability of Goodyear and certain of its subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of the Goodyear's subsidiaries to pay dividends to Goodyear, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, if the Notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moody's and S&P and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended.
     The Indenture provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or other agreements in the Indenture, defaults in failure to pay certain other indebtedness, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all of Notes to be due and payable.
     A copy of the Indenture is attached as Exhibit 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The descriptions of the material terms of the Indenture and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibit.
(c) Registration Rights Agreement.
     In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Goodyear entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), dated as of June 23, 2005, with the Initial Purchasers. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, Goodyear agreed for the benefit of the holders of the Notes that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and cause to become effective a registration statement

relating to an offer to (i) exchange the Notes for an issue of registered notes (the "exchange notes") having substantially the same terms as the Notes, and (ii) exchange the related guarantees for registered guarantees having substantially the same terms as the original guarantees.

     In the Registration Rights Agreement, Goodyear agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers and the holders of the Notes against certain liabilities in connection with the exchange offer or registration statement, as the case may be, or contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

determined by the Company) during such same period to amend or supplement the Offering Memorandum, to notify you and upon your request to prepare and furnish without charge to each Purchaser and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as you may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Offering Memorandum or a supplement to the Offering Memorandum which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; (d) To advise the Purchasers promptly, and confirm such advice in writing, (i) of the issuance by any governmental or regulatory authority of any order preventing or suspending the use of the Offering Memorandum or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (ii) of the receipt by the Company of any notice with respect to any suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offer and sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order preventing or suspending the use of the Offering Memorandum or suspending any such qualification of the Securities and, if any such order is issued, will obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof; (e) During the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing until the date 90 days after the Closing Date, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided hereunder any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors that are substantially similar to the Securities, without your prior written consent; (f) Not to be or become, at any time prior to the expiration of two years after the Closing Date, an open-end investment company, unit investment trust, closed-end investment company or face-amount certificate company that is or is required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act; (g) So long as the Securities remain outstanding and are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, at any time when the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, for the benefit of holders from time to time of Securities, to furnish at its expense, upon request, to holders of Securities and prospective purchasers of Securities information (the "Additional Issuer Information") satisfying the requirements of subsection (d)(4)(i) of Rule 144A under the Securities Act; (h) To use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Securities to be eligible for the PORTAL trading system of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and for clearance and settlement through the Depository Trust Company; (i) Except if such information is available on the website of either the Company or the Commission, to furnish to the holders of the Securities as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year an annual report (including a balance sheet and statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries certified by independent public accountants) and, as soon as practicable after the end of each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal quarter ending after the date of the Offering Memorandum), to make available to its shareholders consolidated unaudited summary financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries for such quarter in reasonable detail; 13

The Company covenants and agrees with the several Purchasers that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the issuance of the Securities and all other expenses in connection with the preparation and printing of the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Offering Memorandum and any amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Purchasers and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing this Agreement, the Guarantees, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Indenture, the Blue Sky and Legal Investment Memoranda, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering 14

The obligations of the Purchasers hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors herein are, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, true and correct, the condition that the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall have performed all of their respective obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Purchasers, shall have furnished to you such opinion or opinions, dated as of the Closing Date with respect to such matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (b) C.

results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, except as set forth or contemplated in the Offering Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto on or after the date hereof), the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Purchasers so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering, sale or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in this Agreement and the Offering Memorandum; (e) On or after the date hereof (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; (f) On or after the date hereof there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Purchasers makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering, sale or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Offering Memorandum; (g) The Securities shall have been designated for trading on PORTAL; (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you as of the Closing Date the certificate of an officer of the Company reasonably satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors herein at and as of the Closing Date, as to the performance by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors of all of their respective obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Closing Date, as to the matters set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request; and (i) The Purchasers shall have received on the Closing Date a counterpart of the Registration Rights Agreement that shall have been executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors. 8. (a) The Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Purchaser may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Offering Memorandum, 16
or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Purchaser in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Offering Memorandum or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Purchaser through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. expressly for use therein. (b) Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Offering Memorandum, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Offering Memorandum or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Purchaser expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; provided that (i) the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection and (ii) the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the 17
settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Purchasers, in each case as set forth herein. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand or the Purchasers on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Purchasers' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and 18
not joint. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) The obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Subsidiaries Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Purchasers under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Purchasers may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. 9. If any one or more Purchaser shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Purchaser hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Purchasers shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Purchasers) the Securities which the defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Purchasers shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Purchasers do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Purchaser or the Company. In the event of a default by any Purchaser as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and the Company shall determine in order that the required changes in the Offering Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

The respective indemnities, agreements, representations and warranties of and certificates delivered by the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the several Purchasers, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any controlling person of any Purchaser, or the Company, or the Subsidiary Guarantors, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 11. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not then be under any liability to any Purchaser except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors 19
will, jointly and severally, reimburse the Purchasers through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Purchasers in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall then be under no further liability to any Purchaser except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof. 12. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Purchasers, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Purchaser made or given by you jointly as the Purchasers.

Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Purchasers, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and each person who controls the Company the Subsidiary Guarantors or any Purchaser, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Purchaser shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 15. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 16. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Purchasers imposing any limitation of any kind.

"Additional Securities" means Securities issued under this Indenture after the Closing Date and in compliance with Sections 2.13, 4.03 and 4.09, it being understood that any Securities issued in exchange for or replacement of any Initial Security issued on the Closing Date shall not be an Additional Security, including any such Securities issued pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement (as defined in Appendix A attached hereto).

For the purposes of this definition, "control" when used with respect to any Person means the power to direct the management and policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

In the case of any lease which is terminable by the lessee upon payment of a penalty, the Attributable Debt shall be the lesser of (i) the Attributable Debt determined assuming termination upon the first date such lease may be terminated (in which case the Attributable Debt shall also include the amount of the penalty, but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid under such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so terminated) and (ii) the Attributable Debt determined assuming no such termination. "Average Life" means, as of the date of determination, with respect to any Indebtedness or Preferred Stock, the quotient obtained by dividing: (1) the sum of the products of the number of years from the date of determination to the dates of each successive scheduled principal payment of such Indebtedness or scheduled redemption or similar payment with respect to such Preferred Stock multiplied by the amount of such payment by (2) the sum of all such payments.

4 indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company; (2) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the board of directors of the Company (together with any new directors whose election by such board of directors of the Company or whose nomination for election by the shareholders of the Company was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors of the Company then still in office who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the board of directors of the Company then in office; (3) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or (4) the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person or the merger of another Person with or into the Company, or the sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company (as determined on a Consolidated basis) to another Person, and, in the case of any such merger or consolidation, the securities of the Company that are outstanding immediately prior to such transaction and which represent 100% of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company are changed into or exchanged for cash, securities or property, unless pursuant to such transaction such securities are changed into or exchanged for, in addition to any other consideration, securities of the surviving Person or transferee that represent immediately after such transaction, at least a majority of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person or transferee. "Closing Date" means June 23, 2005. "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. "Company" means the party named as such in this Indenture until a successor replaces it and, thereafter, means the successor and, for purposes of any provision contained herein and required by the TIA, each other obligor on the indenture securities. "Consolidated Coverage Ratio" as of any date of determination means the ratio of: (1) the aggregate amount of EBITDA for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which financial statements have been filed with the SEC to (2) Consolidated Interest Expense for such four fiscal quarters;

7 account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness if such Interest Rate Agreement has a remaining term as at the date of determination in excess of 12 months).

Unless the context otherwise requires: (1) a term has the meaning assigned to it; (2) an accounting term not otherwise defined has the meaning assigned to it in accordance with GAAP; (3) "or" is not exclusive; (4) "including" means including without limitation; (5) words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular; (6) unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinate or junior to secured Indebtedness merely by virtue of its nature as unsecured Indebtedness; (7) secured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinate or junior to any other secured Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral; (8) the principal amount of any noninterest bearing or other discount security at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the issuer dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP; (9) the principal amount of any Preferred Stock shall be (A) the maximum liquidation value of such Preferred Stock or (B) the maximum mandatory redemption or mandatory repurchase price with respect to such Preferred Stock, whichever is greater; and (10) all references to the date the Securities were originally issued shall refer to the Closing Date.
35 ARTICLE 2 The Securities SECTION 2.01. Form and Dating. Provisions relating to the Initial Securities and the Exchange Securities are set forth in Appendix A attached hereto (the "Appendix") which is hereby incorporated in, and expressly made part of, this Indenture. The Initial Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 to this Indenture, which are hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Exchange Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 2 to this Indenture which are hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule, agreements to which the Company is subject, if any, or usage (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company). Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. The terms of the Securities set forth in the Appendix and Exhibit 1 are part of the terms of this Indenture. The Securities shall be issuable only in registered form without interest coupons and only in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. SECTION 2.02. Execution and Authentication. Two Officers shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature. If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless. A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery Securities as set forth in Appendix A. The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Securities. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands. SECTION 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent. (a) The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency located in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, where Securities may be presented for payment (the "Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents provided, however, that so long as Wells Fargo Bank,
36 National Association shall be the Trustee, without the consent of the Trustee, there shall be no more than one Registrar or Paying Agent. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the terms of the TIA. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Company or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary incorporated or organized within The United States of America may act as Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or transfer agent. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, and the Company may require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register transfer or exchanges of Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of Securities to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed, or any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of an interest payment date. The Holder of a Security may be treated as the owner of such Security for all purposes. (b) The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities and Securities Custodian with respect to the Global Securities. (c) The Company may remove any Registrar or Paying Agent upon written notice to such Registrar or Paying Agent and to the Trustee; provided, however, that no such removal shall become effective until (i) acceptance of an appointment by a successor as evidence by an appropriate agreement entered into by the Company and such successor Registrar or Paying Agent, as the case may be, and delivered to the Trustee or (ii) notification to the Trustee that the Trustee shall serve as Registrar or Paying Agent until the appointment of a successor in accordance with clause (i) above. SECTION 2.04. Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust. Prior to each due date of the principal and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or a Subsidiary is acting as Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of Holders entitled thereto) a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all
37 money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. SECTION 2.05. Lists of Holders of Securities. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders. SECTION 2.06. Transfer and Exchange. (a) The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only in compliance with Appendix A and upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer. When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture and Section 8-401(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met. (b) To permit registration of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all taxes, assessments or other governmental charges in connection with any transfer or exchange pursuant to this Section. The Company shall not be required to make and the Registrar need not register transfer or exchanges of Securities selected for redemption in accordance with the terms of this Indenture (except, in the case of Securities to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed or any Securities for a period of 15 days before an interest payment date. Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name a Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (subject to paragraph 2 of the Securities) interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security is overdue, and none of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, or the Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Security shall, by acceptance of such beneficial interest, agree that transfers of beneficial interest in such Global Security may be effected only through a book-entry system maintained by (a) the Holder of such Global Security (or its agent) or (b) any Holder of a beneficial interest in
38 such Global Security, and that ownership of a beneficial interest in such Global Security shall be required to be reflected in a book entry. All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of this Indenture shall evidence the same Indebtedness and shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange. SECTION 2.07. Replacement Securities. If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security. Every replacement Security is an additional Obligation of the Company. The provisions of this Section 2.07 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Securities. SECTION 2.08. Outstanding Securities. Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. Subject to Section 11.06, a Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security. If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser. If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue. SECTION 2.09. Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for
39 temporary Securities upon surrender of such temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company, without charge to the Holder. SECTION 2.10. Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and destroy (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. The Trustee shall not authenticate Securities in place of cancelled Securities other than pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. SECTION 2.11. Defaulted Interest. If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed to each Holder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. SECTION 2.12. CUSIP Numbers and ISINs. The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers and ISINs (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers and ISINs in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided, however, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. SECTION 2.13. Issuance of Additional Securities. After the Closing Date, the Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance, at the time of and after giving effect to such issuance, with Section 4.03 and Section 4.09, to issue Additional Securities of any series under this Indenture, which Securities shall have identical terms as the applicable series of Initial Securities issued on the Closing Date, other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price. All the Securities issued under this Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all purposes of this Indenture; provided, however, that in respect of any amendment, waiver, other modification or optional redemption by the Company that affects only one series of the Securities, such affected series of Securities shall be treated as a single class under this Indenture. With respect to any Additional Securities, the Company shall set forth in an Officers' Certificate, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Trustee (along with a copy of the resolutions of the Board of Directors authorizing the Additional Securities), the following information:
40 (1) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture and the provision of Section 4.03 that the Company is relying on to issue such Additional Securities; (2) the issue price, the issue date, the CUSIP number and ISIN of such Additional Securities; provided, however, that no Additional Securities may be issued at a price that would cause such Additional Securities to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code; and (3) whether such Additional Securities shall be Initial Securities or shall be issued in the form of Exchange Securities as set forth in Exhibit 2. ARTICLE 3 Redemption SECTION 3.01. Notices to Trustee. If the Company elects to redeem Securities of any series pursuant to paragraph 6 of such series of Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the redemption date, the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and the paragraph of such series of Securities pursuant to which the redemption will occur. The Company shall give each notice to the Trustee provided for in this Section at least 45 days before the redemption date unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period. Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officers' Certificate to the effect that such redemption will comply with the conditions herein. Any such notice may be cancelled by the Company at any time prior to notice of such redemption being mailed to any Holder and shall thereby be void and of no effect unless the Trustee has sent the notice of redemption pursuant to Section 3.03 below. SECTION 3.02. Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed. If fewer than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee, subject to the procedures of DTC, shall select the Securities of such series to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by a method that complies with applicable legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate. The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption. The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal amount of Securities of such series that have denominations larger than $1,000. Securities and portions of them the Trustee selects shall be in principal amounts of $1,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Securities or portions of Securities to be redeemed. SECTION 3.03. Notice of Redemption. At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a date for redemption of Securities of a series, the Company, or the Trustee (at the direction of the Company), shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class
41 mail to each Holder of Securities of such series to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address. The notice shall identify the Securities of such series to be redeemed and shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the redemption price; (3) the name and address of the Paying Agent; (4) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price; (5) if fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the identification and principal amounts of the particular Securities to be redeemed; (6) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption payment, interest on Securities (or portion thereof) called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date; and (7) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number or ISIN, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Securities. At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense. In such event, the Company shall provide the Trustee with the information required by this Section. SECTION 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is mailed to Holders, Securities of a series called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price stated in the notice. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date if the redemption date is after a regular record date and on or prior to the interest payment date). Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder. SECTION 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on all Securities of a series or portions thereof to be redeemed on that date other than Securities of such series or portions of Securities of such series called for redemption which have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation. Interest shall cease to accrue on Securities or portions thereof called for redemption on and after the date the
42 Company has deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the Securities to be redeemed, unless the Paying Agent is prohibited from making such payment pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. SECTION 3.06. Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder (at the Company's expense) a new Security equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered. ARTICLE 4 Covenants SECTION 4.01. Payment of Securities. The Company shall promptly pay the principal of and interest on the Securities on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities and in this Indenture. Principal and interest shall be considered paid on the date due if on such date the Trustee or the Paying Agent holds in accordance with this Indenture money sufficient to pay all principal and interest then due. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate specified therefor in the Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. SECTION 4.02. SEC Reports. Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall file with the SEC and provide the Trustee and Holders and prospective Holders (upon request) within 15 days after it files them with the SEC, copies of its annual report and the information, documents and other reports that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee and the Holders, promptly upon their becoming available, copies of the annual report to shareholders and any other information provided by the Company to its public shareholders generally. The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of Section 314(a) of the TIA. In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders of the Securities and to prospective investors, upon the requests of such Holders, any information with respect to the Company required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Securities are not freely transferable under the Securities Act. SECTION 4.03. Limitation on Indebtedness. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur, directly or indirectly, any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving effect thereto and the application of the proceeds therefrom the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.0:1.0.
43 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur the following Indebtedness: (1) (x) U.S. Bank Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (A) $3,000,000,000, less the aggregate amount of all prepayments of principal applied to permanently reduce any such Indebtedness in satisfaction of the Company's obligations under Section 4.06 and (B) the sum of (i) 60% of the book value of the inventory of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries plus (ii) 80% of the book value of the accounts receivable of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than any accounts receivable pledged, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction), in each case, as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been filed with the SEC and (y) European Bank Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed (euro)525,000,000; provided, however, that the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) shall be reduced by any amount of Indebtedness Incurred and then outstanding pursuant to the election provision of clause (10)(A)(ii) below; (2) Indebtedness of the Company owed to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owed to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that any subsequent event that results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute the Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the issuer thereof; (3) Indebtedness (A) represented by the Securities issued on the Closing Date (not including any Additional Securities) and the Subsidiary Guarantees, (B) outstanding on the Closing Date (other than the Indebtedness described in clauses (1) and (2) above and clause (12) below), and (C) consisting of Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (3) (including Indebtedness that is Refinancing Indebtedness) or the foregoing paragraph (a); (4) (A) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary Incurred and outstanding on or prior to the date on which such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness Incurred in contemplation of, in connection with, as consideration in, or to provide all or any
44 portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Subsidiary of or was otherwise acquired by the Company); provided, however, that on the date that such Restricted Subsidiary is acquired by the Company, (i) the Company would have been able to Incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the foregoing paragraph (a) after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (4) or (ii) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately after giving effect to such Incurrence and acquisition would be greater than such ratio immediately prior to such transaction and (B) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary in respect of Indebtedness Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to this clause (4); (5) Indebtedness (A) in respect of performance bonds, bankers' acceptances, letters of credit and surety or appeal bonds entered into by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business, and (B) Hedging Obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business to hedge risks with respect to the Company's or a Restricted Subsidiary's interest rate, currency or raw materials pricing exposure and not entered into for speculative purposes; (6) Purchase Money Indebtedness, Capitalized Lease Obligations and Attributable Debt and Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof in an aggregate principal amount on the date of Incurrence that, when added to all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (6) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (A) $600,000,000 and (B) 5.0% of Consolidated assets of the Company as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been filed with the SEC; (7) Indebtedness Incurred by a Receivables Entity in a Qualified Receivables Transaction; (8) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of a Financial Officer's becoming aware of its Incurrence; (9) any Guarantee (other than the Subsidiary Guarantees) by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other obligations by
45 the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is permitted under the terms of this Indenture (other than Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (4) above); (10) (A) Indebtedness of Foreign Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount that, when added to all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (10)(A) and then outstanding, will not exceed (i) $900,000,000 plus (ii) any amount then permitted to be Incurred pursuant to clause (1) above that the Company instead elects to Incur pursuant to this clause (10)(A); and (B) Indebtedness of Foreign Subsidiaries Incurred in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction in an amount not to exceed (euro)300,000,000 at any one time outstanding; (11) Indebtedness constituting unsecured Indebtedness or Secured Indebtedness in an amount not to exceed $850,000,000 and Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; (12) Indebtedness represented by the Senior Secured Notes and the related Guarantees by Subsidiaries of the Company and Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; and (13) Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount on the date of Incurrence that, when added to all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (13) and then outstanding, will not exceed $150,000,000. (c) For purposes of determining the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this Section 4.03: (1) Outstanding Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any of the Credit Agreements prior to or on the Closing Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of paragraph (b) above; (2) Indebtedness permitted by this Section 4.03 need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness, and (3) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in this Section 4.03, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall classify such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) as of the time of Incurrence and will only be required to include the amount of such Indebtedness in one of
46 such clauses (provided that any Indebtedness originally classified as Incurred pursuant to Sections 4.03(b)(2) through (b)(13) may later be reclassified as having been Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or any other of Sections 4.03(b)(2) through (b)(13) to the extent that such reclassified Indebtedness could be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or one of Sections 4.03(b)(2) through (b)(13), as the case may be, if it were Incurred at the time of such reclassification). (d) For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar or euro denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness where the Indebtedness Incurred is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Indebtedness will be the U.S. Dollar Equivalent or Euro Equivalent, as the case may be, determined on the date of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness; provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to U.S. dollars or euros, as the case may be, covering all principal, premium, if any, and interest payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollars or euros will be as provided in such Currency Agreement. The principal amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being Refinanced will be the U.S. Dollar Equivalent or Euro Equivalent, as appropriate, of the Indebtedness Refinanced determined on the date of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, except to the extent that (1) such U.S. Dollar Equivalent or Euro Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and (2) the principal amount of the Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being Refinanced, in which case the U.S. Dollar Equivalent or Euro Equivalent, as appropriate, of such excess will be determined on the date such Refinancing Indebtedness is Incurred. SECTION 4.04. Limitation on Restricted Payments. (d) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to make any Restricted Payment if at the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes any Restricted Payment: (1) a Default will have occurred and be continuing (or would result therefrom); (2) the Company could not Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under Section 4.03(a); or (3) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments (the amount so expended, if other than in cash, to be determined in good faith by a Financial Officer of the Company, whose determination will be conclusive; provided, however, that with respect to any noncash Restricted Payment in excess of $25,000,000, the amount so expended shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the definition of

49 amendments thereto) approved by the Board of Directors under which such individuals purchase or sell or are granted the option to purchase or sell, shares of such Capital Stock; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of such Purchases for value will not exceed $10,000,000 in any calendar year; provided further, however, that any of the $10,000,000 permitted to be applied for Purchases under this Section 4.04(b)(4) in a calendar year (and not so applied) may be carried forward for use in the following two calendar years; provided further, however, that such Purchases for value shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; (5) so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, payments of dividends on Disqualified Stock issued after the Reference Date pursuant to Section 4.03; provided, however, that such dividends shall be included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; (6) repurchases of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon exercise of stock options if such Capital Stock represents a portion of the exercise price of such options; provided, however, that such Restricted Payments shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; (7) so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, any prepayment, repayment or Purchase for value of Subordinated Obligations from Net Available Cash to the extent permitted under Section 4.06; provided, however, that such prepayment, repayment or Purchase for value shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; (8) payments to holders of Capital Stock (or to the holders of Indebtedness that is convertible into or exchangeable for Capital Stock upon such conversion or exchange) in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares; provided, however, that such payments shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; or (9) any Restricted Payment in an amount which, when taken together with all Restricted Payments made after the Reference Date pursuant to this Section 4.04(b)(9), does not exceed $50,000,000; provided, however, that (A) at the time of each such Restricted Payment, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or result therefrom) and (B) such Restricted Payments shall be included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments. SECTION 4.05. Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company; (2) make any loans or advances to the Company; or
50 (3) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company, except: (A) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order or an agreement in effect at or entered into on the Closing Date; (B) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to an agreement relating to any Indebtedness Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary prior to the date on which such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Company (other than Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, in contemplation of, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company) and outstanding on such date; (C) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement effecting a Refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to an agreement referred to in Section 4.05(3)(A) or Section 4.05(3)(B) or this Section 4.05(3)(C) or contained in any amendment to an agreement referred to in Section 4.05(3)(A) or Section 4.05(3)(B) or this Section 4.05(3)(C); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such Refinancing agreement or amendment are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in such predecessor agreements; (D) in the case of Section 4.05(3), any encumbrance or restriction (i) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any such lease, license or other contract; or (ii) contained in mortgages, pledges and other security agreements securing Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent such encumbrance or restriction restricts the transfer of the property subject to such security agreements; (E) with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary, any restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale or disposition;
51 (F) any encumbrance or restriction existing under or by reason of Indebtedness or other contractual requirements of a Receivables Entity in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction; provided, however, that such restrictions apply only to such Receivables Entity; (G) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and Capitalized Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or leased of the nature described in Section 4.05(3); (H) provisions with respect to the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements; (I) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers, suppliers or, in the ordinary course of business, other third parties; and (J) with respect to any Foreign Subsidiary, any encumbrance or restriction contained in the terms of any Indebtedness, or any agreement pursuant to which such Indebtedness was issued, if: (i) the encumbrance or restriction applies only in the event of a payment default or a default with respect to a financial covenant contained in such Indebtedness or agreement, or (ii) at the time such Indebtedness is Incurred, such encumbrance or restriction is not expected to materially affect the Company's ability to make principal or interest payments on the Securities, as determined in good faith by a Financial Officer of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive. SECTION 4.06. Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock. (d) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless: (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming sole responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition, (2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Additional Assets; provided, however, that the 75% consideration requirement of this Section 4.06(a)(2) shall not apply to any Specified Asset Sale, and
52 (3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be): (A) first, to the extent the Company elects (or is required by the terms of any applicable Indebtedness) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase, repurchase, redeem, retire, defease or otherwise acquire for value Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor or (ii) to cause any loan commitment that is available to be drawn under the applicable credit facility and to be Incurred under this Indenture and that when drawn would constitute Secured Indebtedness, to be permanently reduced by the amount of Net Available Cash, in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company and other than obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock, within 365 days after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; (B) second, to acquire Additional Assets (or otherwise to make capital expenditures), in each case within 365 days after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; (C) third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with Section 4.06(a)(3)(A) and Section 4.06(a)(3)(B), to make an Offer (as defined in Section 4.06 (c)) to purchase Securities pursuant to and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.06(c); provided, however, that if the Company elects (or is required by the terms of any other Senior Indebtedness), such Offer may be made ratably to purchase the Securities and any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and (D) fourth, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with Sections 4.06(a)(3)(A), 4.06(a)(3)(B) and 4.06(a)(3)(C), for any general corporate purpose permitted by the terms of this Indenture; provided, however that in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition for value of Indebtedness pursuant to Section 4.06(a)(3)(A) or Section 4.06(a)(3)(C), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall retire such Indebtedness and shall cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased, repurchased, redeemed, retired, defeased or otherwise acquired for value.
53 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.06(a)(3), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with this Section 4.06 except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions that is not applied in accordance with this Section 4.06 exceeds $25,000,000. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 4.06, such Net Available Cash may be used or invested in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture. (b) For the purposes of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption of Indebtedness or other obligations of the Company (other than obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock of the Company) or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or obligations in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) any Designated Noncash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, does not exceed at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of (1) $200,000,000 and (2) 1.5% of the total Consolidated assets of the Company as shown on the most recent balance sheet of the Company filed with the SEC; (3) securities, notes or similar obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are promptly converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash; and (4) Temporary Cash Investments. (c) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Securities pursuant to Section 4.06(a)(3)(C), the Company shall be required (i) to purchase Securities tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Securities (the "Offer") at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription), set forth in Section 4.06(d) and (ii) to purchase other Senior Indebtedness of the Company on the terms and to the extent contemplated thereby; provided that in no event shall the Company offer to purchase such Senior Indebtedness of the Company at a purchase price in excess of 100% of its principal amount (without premium) or, unless otherwise provided for in such
54 Senior Indebtedness, the accreted amount, if issued with original issue discount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. If the aggregate purchase price of Securities (and Senior Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to the Offer is less than the Net Available Cash allotted to the purchase of the Securities (and other Senior Indebtedness), the Company will apply the remaining Net Available Cash in accordance with Section 4.06(a)(3)(D). The Company shall not be required to make an Offer for Securities (and Senior Indebtedness) pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in Section 4.06(a)(3)(A) and Section 4.06(a)(3)(B)) is less than $25,000,000 for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amount will be carried forward for purposes of determining whether an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). (d) (1) If the aggregate purchase price of Securities (and other Senior Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to the Offer exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company shall select the Securities (and other Senior Indebtedness) to be purchased on a pro rata basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that only Securities and other Senior Indebtedness in denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall be purchased). (2) Promptly, and in any event within 10 days after the Company becomes obligated to make an Offer, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by first-class mail to each Holder, a written notice stating that the Holder may elect to have his Securities purchased by the Company either in whole or in part (subject to prorating as described in Section 4.06(d)(1) in the event the Offer is oversubscribed) in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount at the applicable purchase price. The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date"). (3) Not later than the date upon which written notice of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided below, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as to (A) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), including information as to any other Senior Indebtedness included in the Offer for repurchase, (B) the allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Dispositions pursuant to which such Offer is being made and (C) the compliance of such allocation with the provisions of Section 4.06(a) and (c). By 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Purchase Date, the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) in Temporary Cash Investments, maturing on the last day prior to the Purchase Date or on the Purchase Date if funds are immediately available by open of business, an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the Offer includes other Senior Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made with any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the Securities or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company.
55 The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the Securities delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the Securities, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period for application in accordance with this Section 4.06. (4) Holders electing to have a Security purchased shall be required to surrender the Security, with an appropriate form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date. A Holder shall be entitled to withdraw its election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the Purchase Date, a telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of the Security which was delivered for purchase by such Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Security purchased. Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part shall be issued new Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered. (5) At the time the Company delivers Securities to the Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company shall also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such Securities are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section. A Security shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time the Trustee, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers payment therefor to the surrendering Holder. (e) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Securities pursuant to this Section 4.06. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.06, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 4.06 by virtue thereof. SECTION 4.07. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an "Affiliate Transaction") unless such transaction is on terms: (1) that are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained at the time of such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate,
56 (2) that, in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate amount in excess of $25,000,000, (A) are set forth in writing, and (B) have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors having no personal stake in such Affiliate Transaction and, (3) that, in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $75,000,000, have been determined by a nationally recognized appraisal, accounting or investment banking firm to be fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. (b) The provisions of Section 4.07(a) will not prohibit: (1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be paid pursuant to Section 4.04, (2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans approved by the Board of Directors, (3) the grant of stock options or similar rights to employees and directors of the Company pursuant to plans approved by the Board of Directors, (4) loans or advances to employees in the ordinary course of business of the Company, (5) the payment of reasonable fees and compensation to, or the provision of employee benefit arrangements and indemnity for the benefit of, directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, (6) any transaction between or among any of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any joint venture or similar entity which would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Restricted Subsidiary, joint venture or similar entity, (7) the issuance or sale of any Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, (8) any agreement as in effect on the Closing Date and described in the Private Placement Memorandum or in the Company's SEC filings as filed on or prior to the Closing Date, or any renewals, extensions or amendments of any such agreement (so long as such renewals, extensions or amendments are not less
57 favorable in any material respect to the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries) and the transactions evidenced thereby, (9) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture which are fair to the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party, or (10) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Transaction. SECTION 4.08. Change of Control. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder shall have the right to require the Company to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in accordance with Section 4.08(b). (b) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee (the "Change of Control Offer"), stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such Holder has the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of such Holder's Securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change of Control; (3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); and (4) the instructions determined by the Company, consistent with this Section 4.08, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Securities purchased. (c) The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 4.08 applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. In addition, the Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control in respect of any Securities called for
58 redemption to the extent that the Company mails a valid notice of redemption to Holders prior to the Change of Control, and thereafter redeems all Securities called for redemption in accordance with the terms set forth in such redemption notice. (d) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Securities pursuant to this Section 4.08. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.08, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 4.08 by virtue thereof. (e) On the purchase date, all Securities purchased by the Company under this Section 4.08 shall be delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall pay the purchase price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Holders entitled thereto. SECTION 4.09. Limitation on Liens. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Incur or permit to exist any Lien (the "Initial Lien") of any nature whatsoever on any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned at the Closing Date or thereafter acquired securing any Indebtedness, other than Permitted Liens, without effectively providing that the Notes shall be secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) the obligations so secured for so long as such obligations are so secured. Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien. SECTION 4.10. Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback Transaction with respect to any property unless: (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to: (A) Incur Indebtedness with respect to such Sale/Leaseback Transaction pursuant to Section 4.03 and (B) create a Lien on such property securing such Indebtedness without equally and ratably securing the Securities pursuant to Section 4.09; (2) the gross proceeds payable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such Sale/Leaseback Transaction are at least equal to the Fair Market Value of such property; and
59 (3) the transfer of such property is permitted by, and, if applicable, the Company applies the proceeds of such transaction in compliance with, Section 4.06. SECTION 4.11. Future Subsidiary Guarantors. The Company shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that Guarantees any Indebtedness of the Company or of any Subsidiary Guarantor to become a Subsidiary Guarantor, and if applicable, execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form set forth in Exhibit 3 hereto pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall Guarantee payment of the Securities. Each Subsidiary Guarantee shall be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be Guaranteed by that Subsidiary Guarantor, without rendering the Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. SECTION 4.12. Suspension of Certain Covenants. (a) Following the first day (the "Suspension Date") that: (1) the Securities have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies, and (2) no Default has occurred and is continuing hereunder, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.11 and Section 5.01(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants"). In addition, the Company may elect to suspend the Subsidiary Guarantees. (b) In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the foregoing and on any subsequent date (the "Reversion Date") one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the Securities below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events, the Subsidiary Guarantees shall be reinstated. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to herein as the "Suspension Period." (c) Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no default shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period. During any Suspension Period, the Company shall not designate any Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary unless the Company would have been permitted to designate such Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if a Suspension Period had not been in effect for any period. (d) On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period shall be classified to have been Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03 (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension
60 Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or Section 4.03(b), such Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been outstanding on the Closing Date, so that it is classified as permitted under Section 4.03(b)(3)(B). Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under Section 4.04 shall be made as though Section 4.04 had been in effect since the Closing Date and throughout the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period shall reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under Section 4.04(a) and the items specified in Section 4.04(a)(3) shall increase the amount available to be made under Section 4.04(a). For purposes of determining compliance with Section 4.06(a) and Section 4.06(b), the Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions not applied in accordance with Section 4.06 shall be deemed to be reset to zero. (e) In addition, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may honor any contractual commitments to take actions after a Reversion Date as long as such contractual commitments were entered into during a Suspension Period and not in anticipation of the Securities' no longer having an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies.

(a) The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets, in one or a series of related transactions, to, any Person, unless: (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") will be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, (A) the Successor Company would be able to Incur an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness under Section 4.03(a) or (B) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company would be greater than such ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and (4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with this Indenture. (b) The Successor Company shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture, and the predecessor Company, other than in the case of a lease, shall be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Securities. (c) The Company shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets, in or a series of related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) except in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor (i) that has been disposed of in its entirety to another Person (other than to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), whether through a merger, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock or assets or (ii) that, as a result of the disposition of all or a portion of its Capital Stock, ceases to be a Subsidiary, the resulting, surviving or
62 transferee Person (the "Successor Guarantor") shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and such Person (if not such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (3) the Company will have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with this Indenture. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) any Restricted Subsidiary may Consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor and (2) the Company may merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction within the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia to realize tax or other benefits. ARTICLE 6 Defaults and Remedies SECTION 6.01. Events of Default. An "Event of Default" occurs if: (1) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Security when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for 30 days; (2) the Company defaults in the payment of principal of any Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption or required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (3) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 5.01; (4) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with Section 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 or 4.12 (in each case,
63 other than a failure to purchase Securities) and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (5) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with its agreements contained in the Securities or this Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (6) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent; (7) the Company or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law: (A) commences a voluntary case; (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case; (C) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property; or (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; (8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (A) is for relief against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case; (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its property; or (C) orders the winding up or liquidation of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; (9) any final and nonappealable judgment or decree (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so
64 covered) is rendered against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary and such final judgment or decree remains outstanding and is not satisfied, discharged or waived within a period of 60 days following such judgment; or (10) any Subsidiary Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect in all material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice specified below. The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether such Event of Default is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a default under Section 6.01(4), 6.01(5), 6.01(6), 6.01(9) or 6.01(10) (only with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary) shall not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities notify the Company and the Trustee of the default and the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, does not cure such default within any applicable time specified in Section 6.01(4), 6.01(5), 6.01(6), 6.01(9) or 6.01(10) hereof after receipt of such notice. The term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, United States Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any Event of Default under Section 6.01(6), 6.01(10), or 6.01(11) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under Section 6.01(4), 6.01(5) or 6.01(9), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. SECTION 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or 6.01(8)) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Company may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or 6.01(8) with respect to the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or
65 interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto. SECTION 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative. SECTION 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences except (a) a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a Security (b) a Default arising from the failure to redeem or purchase any Security when required pursuant to this Indenture or (c) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right. SECTION 6.05. Control by Majority. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Subject to Section 7.01, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against any loss, liability or expense which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. SECTION 6.06. Limitation on Suits. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless: (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
66 (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period. A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder. SECTION 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or 6.01(2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07. SECTION 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. SECTION 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order: FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07; SECOND: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and
67 THIRD: to the Company. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before such record date, the Company shall mail to each Holder and the Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid. SECTION 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the Securities. SECTION 6.12. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE 7 Trustee SECTION 7.01. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person's own affairs. (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall
68 examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture. (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own wilful misconduct, except that: (1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section; (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05. (d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section. (e) (e) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. (f) Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. (g) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (h) Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and to the provisions of the TIA. SECTION 7.02. Rights of Trustee. (a) The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document. (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. (c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
69 (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Trustee's conduct does not constitute wilful misconduct or negligence. (e) The Trustee may consult with counsel, and the advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Securities shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel. (f) The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety in respect of the performance of its powers and duties hereunder (g) The Trustee shall not be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any covenants, conditions, or agreements on the part of the Company, except as otherwise set forth herein, but the Trustee may require of the Company full information and advice as to the performance of the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein. (h) The permissive rights of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty and, with respect to such permissive rights, the Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its negligence or willful misconduct; (i) Except for a default under Sections 6.01(1) or (2) hereof, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice or be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer shall have received from the Company or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding written notice thereof at its address set forth in Section 11.02 hereof, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture. In the absence of any such notice, the Trustee may conclusively assume that no Default or Event of Default exists. SECTION 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or co-paying agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11. SECTION 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement of the Company in this Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the sale of the Securities or in the Securities other than the Trustee's certificate of authentication. SECTION 7.05. Notice of Defaults. If a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a Trust Officer, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder notice of the Default within the earlier of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is actually
70 known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any Security (including payments pursuant to the redemption provisions of such Security), the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. SECTION 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. At the expense of the Company, as promptly as practicable after each January 1 beginning with January 1, 2005, and in any event prior to March 1 in each such year, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such January 1 that complies with TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b). A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Securities are listed. The Company agrees to notify promptly the Trustee whenever the Securities become listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof. SECTION 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its services as shall be agreed to in writing from time to time by the Company and the Trustee. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee's agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, employees and attorneys against any and all loss, liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by it in connection with the administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall provide reasonable cooperation in such defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company, provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay such fees and expenses if the Company assumes such defense unless there is a conflict of interest between the Company and the Trustee in connection with such defense as determined by Trustee in consultation with counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own wilful misconduct, negligence or bad faith. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities.
71 The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law. SECTION 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee. The Company shall remove the Trustee if: (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; (2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; (3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, unless the Trustee's duty to resign is stayed as provided in TIA Section 310(b), any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
72 SECTION 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger. If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee. In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have. SECTION 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA Section 310(a). The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 310(b); provided, however, that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA Section 310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA Section 310(b)(1) are met. SECTION 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated. ARTICLE 8 Discharge of Indenture; Defeasance SECTION 8.01. Discharge of Liability on Securities; Defeasance. (a) When (1) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Securities (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07) for cancellation or (2) all outstanding Securities have become due and payable, whether at maturity or on a redemption date as a result of the mailing of a notice of redemption pursuant to Article 3 hereof and, in the case of clause (2), the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee funds or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Securities, including premium, if any, and interest thereon to maturity or such redemption date (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07), and if in either case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.01(c), cease to be of further effect. Upon satisfaction of the above conditions, the Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
73 (b) Subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.02, the Company at any time may terminate (1) all its obligations under the Securities and this Indenture with respect to any series of Securities ("legal defeasance option") or (2) its obligations under Sections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.12 and the operation of Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) and the limitations contained in Section 5.01(a)(3) ("covenant defeasance option"). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the applicable series of Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(a)(3). In the event that the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee. Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates. (c) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 7.07 and 7.08 and in this Article 8 shall survive until the Securities have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 shall survive. SECTION 8.02. Conditions to Defeasance. The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if: (1) the Company irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee money in U.S. Dollars in an amount sufficient or U.S. Government Obligations, the principal of and interest on which shall be sufficient, or a combination thereof sufficient, to pay the principal of, premium (if any) and interest in respect of the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Securities to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
74 (3) 91 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 91-day period no Default specified in Sections 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company occurs which is continuing at the end of the period; (4) the deposit does not constitute a default under any other material agreement binding on the Company; (5) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940; (6) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred; and (7) in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and covenant defeasance had not occurred. Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date in accordance with Article 3. SECTION 8.03. Application of Trust Money. The Trustee shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article 8.

SECTION 8.04. Repayment to Company. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly turn over to the Company upon request any excess money or securities held by them at any time. Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors.
75 SECTION 8.05. Indemnity for Government Obligations. The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against deposited U.S. Government Obligations or the principal and interest received on such U.S. Government Obligations. SECTION 8.06. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's and each Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture, each Subsidiary Guarantee and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 8 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8; provided, however, that, if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. ARTICLE 9 Amendments SECTION 9.01. Without Consent of Holders. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities without notice to or consent of any Holder: (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; (2) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under this Indenture in compliance with Article 5; (3) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; provided, however, that the uncertificated Securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code or in a manner such that the uncertificated Securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code; (4) to add Guarantees with respect to the Securities or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any such Guarantee when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under this Indenture; (5) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company; (6) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect, subject to the provisions of this Indenture;
76 (7) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with qualifying, or maintaining the qualification of, this Indenture under the TIA; (8) to make any amendment to the provisions of this Indenture relating to form, authentication, transfer and legending of Securities; provided, however, that (A) compliance with this Indenture as so amended would not result in Securities being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (B) such amendment does not materially affect the rights of Holders to transfer Securities; or (9) to provide for the issuance of the Exchange Securities or Additional Securities in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. After an amendment under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section. SECTION 9.02. With Consent of Holders. (a) The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Securities). Any existing Default or compliance with any provisions of this Indenture or the Securities may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, subject to the restrictions of Section 6.04 and this Section 9.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of each Holder affected thereby, an amendment or waiver may not: (1) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment; (2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Security; (3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Security; (4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which a Security may be redeemed pursuant to Article 3 hereto or paragraph 6 of the Securities; (5) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security; (6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, and interest on, such Holder's Securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder's Securities;
77 (7) make any change in Section 6.04 or 6.07 or the second sentence of this Section 9.02; or (8) make any change in, or release other than in accordance with this Indenture, any Subsidiary Guarantee that would adversely affect the Holders. (b) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section. SECTION 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment to this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect. SECTION 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers. A consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder. An amendment or waiver becomes effective upon the execution of such amendment or waiver by the Trustee. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date. SECTION 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment.
78 SECTION 9.06. Trustee To Sign Amendments. The Trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment the Trustee shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it and to receive, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. SECTION 9.07. Payment for Consent. Neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture or the Securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all Holders that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. ARTICLE 10 Subsidiary Guarantees SECTION 10.01. Guarantees. (a) Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment and performance of all of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor, jointly with the other Subsidiary Guarantors and severally. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors further agrees that its Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any such Guaranteed Obligation. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor of any of its Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee, notice of protest for nonpayment and all similar formalities. (b) Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Trustee or any Holder to any security held for the payment of its Guaranteed Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Trustee or any Holder in favor of the Company. (c) Except for termination of a Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder or a release of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Section 10.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each
79 Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Trustee or any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of this Indenture or otherwise; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Indenture or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Subsidiary Guarantor under this Agreement; (iii) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor; or (iv) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor). (d) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Subsidiary Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor, other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor. The Trustee may, at its election, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor have been fully and indefeasibly paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Subsidiary Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Subsidiary Guarantor against the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be. (e) Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, any other Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise. SECTION 10.02. Limitation on Liability. Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. SECTION 10.03. Successors and Assigns. This Article 10 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the successors, transferees and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and,
80 in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture. SECTION 10.04. No Waiver. Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 10 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 10 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. SECTION 10.05. Modification. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 10, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. SECTION 10.06. Release of Subsidiary Guarantor. A Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this Article 10 (other than any obligation that may have arisen under Section 10.07): (1) upon the sale (including any sale pursuant to any exercise of remedies by a holder of Indebtedness of the Company or of such Subsidiary Guarantor) or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (2) upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor; (3) upon the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, (4) unless there is then existing an Event of Default, at such time and for so long as any such Subsidiary Guarantor that became a Subsidiary Guarantor after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 4.11 does not Guarantee any Indebtedness that would have required such Subsidiary Guarantor to enter into a Supplemental Indenture pursuant to Section 4.11 and the Company provides an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee certifying that no such Guarantee is outstanding and the Company elects to have such Subsidiary Guarantor released from this Article 10, or (5) at any time during a Suspension Period if the Company provides an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee stating that the Company elects to have such Subsidiary Guarantor released from this Article 10, or
81 (6) upon the exercise by the Company of its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option or if the Obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Securities are discharged pursuant to Article 8; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (1) and (2) above, (i) such sale or other disposition is made to a Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) such sale or disposition is otherwise permitted by this Indenture and (iii) the Company complies with its obligations under Section 4.06. At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release. SECTION 10.07. Contribution. Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes a payment under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall be entitled upon payment in full of all Guaranteed Obligations under this Indenture to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Subsidiary Guarantor's pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Subsidiary Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. ARTICLE 11 Miscellaneous SECTION 11.01. Trust Indenture Act Controls. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision which is required to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, the required provision shall control.

Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to the Holder at the Holder's address as it appears on the registration books of the Registrar and shall be sufficiently given if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. SECTION 11.03. Communication by Holders with Other Holders. Holders may communicate pursuant to TIA Section 312(b) with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or the Securities. The Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor, the Trustee, the Registrar and anyone else shall have the protection of TIA Section 312(c). SECTION 11.04. Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Securities which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Also, subject to the foregoing, only Securities outstanding at the time shall be considered in any such determination. SECTION 11.07. Rules by Trustee, Paying Agent and Registrar. The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by or a meeting of Holders. The Registrar and the Paying Agent may make reasonable rules for their functions. SECTION 11.08. Legal Holidays.

By accepting a Security, each Holder shall waive and release all such liability. The waiver and release shall be part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities. SECTION 11.11. Successors.

The Rule 144A Global Security and the Permanent Regulation S Global Security are each referred to herein as a "Global Security" and are collectively referred to herein as "Global Securities", provided, that the term "Global Security" when used in Sections 2.1(b) 2.1(c), 2.3(g)(i), 2.3(h)(i) and 2.4 shall also include any Security in global form issued in connection with a Registered Exchange Offer. The aggregate principal amount of the Global Securities may from time to time be increased or
4 decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee and the Depositary or its nominee and on the schedules thereto as hereinafter provided. (c) Book-Entry Provisions. This Section 2.1(c) shall apply only to a Global Security deposited with or on behalf of the Depository. The Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.2 and pursuant to an order of the Company signed by two Officers, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities that (i) shall be registered in the name of the Depository for such Global Security or Global Securities or the nominee of such Depository and (ii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depository or pursuant to such Depository's instructions or held by the Trustee as Securities Custodian. Members of, or participants in, the Depository ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depository or by the Trustee as Securities Custodian or under such Global Security, and the Depository may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository or impair, as between the Depository and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices of such Depository governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Security. (d) Definitive Securities. Except as provided in Section 2.3 or 2.4, owners of beneficial interests in Global Securities will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Securities. 2.2 Authentication. The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery upon a written order of the Company signed by one Officer (a) original Securities for original issue on the date hereof in an aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000, (b) subject to the terms of this Indenture, Additional Securities in an unlimited aggregate principal amount and (c) the Exchange Securities for issue only in a Registered Exchange Offer pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement and for a like principal amount of Initial Securities exchanged pursuant thereto. Such order shall specify the amount of the Securities to be authenticated and the date on which the original issue of Securities is to be authenticated and whether the Securities are to be Initial Securities or Exchange Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Appendix or otherwise in this Indenture, any issuance of Additional Securities after the Closing Date shall be in a principal amount of at least $1,000. 2.3 Transfer and Exchange. (a) Transfer and Exchange of Definitive Securities. When Definitive Securities are presented to the Registrar with a request: (i) to register the transfer of such Definitive Securities; or
5 (ii) to exchange such Definitive Securities for an equal principal amount of Definitive Securities of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Definitive Securities surrendered for transfer or exchange: (1) shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing; and (2) in the case of Transfer Restricted Securities, are accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable: (A) if such Definitive Securities are being delivered to the Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, a certification from such Holder to that effect (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Initial Security); or (B) if such Definitive Securities are being transferred to the Company, a certification to that effect (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Initial Security); or (C) if such Definitive Securities are being transferred pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act or in reliance upon another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, (x) a certification to that effect (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Initial Security) and (y) if the Company so requests, an opinion of counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to it as to the compliance with the restrictions set forth in the legend set forth in Section 2.3(e)(i). (b) Restrictions on Transfer of a Definitive Security for a Beneficial Interest in a Global Security. A Definitive Security may not be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Security except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Definitive Security, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, together with: (i) certification (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Initial Security) that such Definitive Security is being transferred (1) to a QIB in accordance with Rule 144A or (2) outside the United States in an offshore transaction within the meaning of Regulation S and in compliance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act; and (ii) written instructions directing the Trustee to make, or to direct the Securities Custodian to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Security to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of
6 the Securities represented by the Global Security, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depository account to be credited with such increase, then the Trustee shall cancel such Definitive Security and cause, or direct the Securities Custodian to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depository and the Securities Custodian, the aggregate principal amount of Securities represented by the Global Security to be increased by the aggregate principal amount of the Definitive Security to be exchanged and shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Security equal to the principal amount of the Definitive Security so canceled. If no Global Securities are then outstanding and the Global Security has not been previously exchanged for certificated securities pursuant to Section 2.4, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate, a new Global Security in the appropriate principal amount. (c) Transfer and Exchange of Global Securities. The transfer and exchange of Global Securities or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depository in accordance with this Indenture (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depository therefor. A transferor of a beneficial interest in a Global Security shall deliver a written order given in accordance with the Depository's procedures containing information regarding the participant account of the Depository to be credited with a beneficial interest in such Global Security or another Global Security and such account shall be credited in accordance with such order with a beneficial interest in the applicable Global Security and the account of the Person making the transfer shall be debited by an amount equal to the beneficial interest in the Global Security being transferred. Transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Security to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest either through the Temporary Regulation S Global Security or the Permanent Regulation S Global Security, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, shall be made only upon receipt by the Trustee of a certification in the form provided on the reverse of the Initial Securities from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or (if available) Rule 144 under the Securities Act. (i) If the proposed transfer is a transfer of a beneficial interest in one Global Security to a beneficial interest in another Global Security, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and an increase in the principal amount of the Global Security to which such interest is being transferred in an amount equal to the principal amount of the interest to be so transferred, and the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a corresponding decrease in the principal amount of the Global Security from which such interest is being transferred. (ii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Appendix (other than the provisions set forth in Section 2.4), a Global Security may not be transferred
7 as a whole except by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository, or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor Depository or a nominee of such successor Depository. (iii) In the event that a Global Security is exchanged for Definitive Securities pursuant to Section 2.4 prior to the consummation of a Registered Exchange Offer or the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement with respect to such Securities, such Securities may be exchanged only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.3 (including the certification requirements set forth on the reverse of the Initial Securities intended to ensure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A, Regulation S or such other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act, as the case may be) and such other procedures as may from time to time be adopted by the Company.

(i) Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Security may only be sold, pledged or transferred in accordance with the Applicable Procedures and only (1) to the Company, (2) when and for so long as such security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person whom the selling holder reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (3) in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S, (4) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 144 (if applicable) under the Securities Act or (5) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Security to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through the Rule 144A Global Security shall be made only in accordance with Applicable Procedures and upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor of the beneficial interest in the form provided on the reverse of the Initial Security to the effect that such transfer is being made to a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Such written certification shall no longer be required after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period. (ii) Upon the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Security shall be transferable in accordance with applicable law and the other terms of this Indenture.

10 Security is exchanged for Definitive Securities, transferred in exchange for an interest in another Global Security, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, the principal amount of Securities represented by such Global Security shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the Trustee (if it is then the Securities Custodian for such Global Security) with respect to such Global Security, by the Trustee or the Securities Custodian, to reflect such reduction.

3 [FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF INITIAL SECURITY] 9.00% Senior Note due 2015 1. Interest (a) THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY, an Ohio corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above. The Company shall pay interest semiannually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Interest on the Securities shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from June 23, 2005 until the principal hereof is due. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. (b) Additional Interest--Registration. The Holder of this Security is entitled to the benefits of a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2005, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and certain purchasers of the Securities named therein (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Capitalized terms used in this paragraph (b) but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Registration Rights Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Registration Default, the Company shall notify the Trustee of such Registration Default and pay additional interest to each Holder of Registrable Securities, during the period of such Registration Default in such amounts and subject to such limitations as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. All accrued additional interest shall be paid to Holders in the same manner as interest payments on the Securities on semi-annual payment dates which correspond to interest payment dates for the Securities. Following the cure of all outstanding Registration Defaults, the accrual of additional interest shall cease. The Trustee shall have no responsibility with respect to the determination of the amount of any such additional interest. (c) Additional Interest--General All references to payments of interest include payments of additional interest, if any. 2. Method of Payment The Company shall pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on the December 15 or June 15 next preceding the interest payment date even if Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company shall pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in money of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company or any successor Depository. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest), at the office of the Paying Agent, except that,
4 at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided, however, that payments on a Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States of America if such Holder has elected payment by wire transfer by providing written wire instructions to the Trustee or the Paying Agent on or after the Closing Date but, in any event, no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion). 3. Paying Agent and Registrar Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. 4. Indenture The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of June 23, 2005 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Section 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "TIA"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Holders (as defined in the Indenture) are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of such terms and provisions. The Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. This Security is one of the Initial Securities referred to in the Indenture. The Securities include the Initial Securities and any Exchange Securities issued in exchange for Initial Securities pursuant to the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement. The Initial Securities, any Exchange Securities and all other Securities are treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, among other things, make certain Investments and other Restricted Payments, pay dividends and other distributions, incur Indebtedness, enter into consensual restrictions upon the payment of certain dividends and distributions by such Restricted Subsidiaries, sell assets, including shares of capital stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, enter into or permit certain transactions with Affiliates and create or incur Liens. The Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its property. Following the first day (the "Suspension Date") that (i) the Securities have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.11 and Section 5.01(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants") of the Indenture. In addition, the Company may elect to suspend the Subsidiary Guarantees. Upon and following any Reversion Date, the Company and its
5 Restricted Subsidiaries shall again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events and the Subsidiary Guarantees shall be reinstated. 5. Guarantee The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium and interest on, the Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Indenture. The precise terms of the Guarantee of the Securities and the Guaranteed Obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors are expressly set forth in Article 10 of the Indenture. 6. Optional Redemption Except as set forth below in this paragraph 6 the Company will not be entitled to redeem the Securities. After July 1, 2010, the Company may redeem the Securities, in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing on July 1 of the years set forth below: In addition, prior to July 1, 2008, the Company may, on one or more occasions, redeem up to a maximum of 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Securities (calculated giving effect to any issuance of Additional Securities) with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings by the Company, at a redemption price equal to 109.000% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that (1) at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Securities (calculated giving effect to any issuance of Additional Securities) remains outstanding after giving effect to any such redemption and (2) any such redemption by the Company is made within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering and is made in accordance with certain procedures set forth in the Indenture. In addition, prior to July 1, 2010, the Company may at its option redeem the Securities, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
6 relevant interest payment date). Notice of such redemption must be mailed by first-class mail to each Holder's registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. "Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a Security at any redemption date, the greater of (1) 1.00% of the principal amount of such Security and (2) the excess of (A) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Security on July 1, 2010 (such redemption price being described in the first paragraph in this section exclusive of any accrued interest), plus (ii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Security through July 1, 2010 (but excluding accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Adjusted Treasury Rate, over (B) the principal amount of such note on such redemption date. "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after July 1, 2010, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date, in each case calculated on the third Business Day immediately preceding the redemption date, in each case of (1) and (2), plus 0.50%. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities from the redemption date to July 1, 2010, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of U.S. Dollar denominated corporate debt securities of a maturity most nearly equal to July 1, 2010. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, if clause (2) of the Adjusted Treasury Rate is applicable, the average of three, or if not possible, such lesser number as is obtained by the Company, Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date. "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and its successors and assigns and two other nationally recognized investment banking firms selected by the Company that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers.
7 "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding such redemption date. 7. Sinking Fund The Securities are not subject to any sinking fund. 8. Notice of Redemption Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at his, her or its registered address. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest on all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Securities (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 9. Repurchase of Securities at the Option of Holders Upon a Change of Control, any Holder of Securities will have the right, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture, to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Securities of such Holder at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. In accordance with Section 4.06 of the Indenture, the Company will be required to offer to purchase Securities upon the occurrence of certain events. 10. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and whole multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Securities for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Securities to be redeemed or for a period of 15 days prior to an interest payment date.
8 11. Persons Deemed Owners Except as provided in paragraph 2 hereof, the registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 12. Unclaimed Money If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors and the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further liability with respect to such monies. 13. Discharge and Defeasance Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate some of or all its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of, and interest on the Securities to redemption, or maturity, as the case may be. 14. Amendment, Waiver Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities then outstanding voting as a single class and (ii) any Default may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all of the Securities then outstanding voting as a single class; provided, however, that if any amendment, waiver or other modification will affect only the Securities, only the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities (and not the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all Securities) shall be required. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; (ii) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture in compliance with Article 5 of the Indenture; (iii) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; (iv) to add Guarantees with respect to the Securities or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any such Guarantee or security when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under the Indenture; (v) to add additional covenants or to surrender rights and powers conferred on the Company; (vi) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect, subject to the provisions of the Indenture; (vii) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA; (viii) to make any amendment to provisions of the Indenture relating to form, authentication, transfer and legending of Securities; provided, however, that compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Securities being transferred in violation of the Securities Act; or (ix) to provide for the
9 issuance of the Exchange Securities or Additional Securities in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. 15. Defaults and Remedies An "Event of Default" occurs if: (i) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Security when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for 30 days; (ii) the Company defaults in the payment of principal of any Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption or required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (iii) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 5.01 of the Indenture; (iv) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with Section 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 or 4.12 of the Indenture (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Securities) and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (v) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with its agreements contained in the Securities or the Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (vi) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary under Sections 6.01(7) and (8) of the Indenture; (viii) any final and nonappealable judgment or decree (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) is rendered against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary and such final judgment or decree remains outstanding and is not satisfied, discharged or waived within a period of 60 days following such judgment; or (ix) any Subsidiary Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect in all material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under the Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice specified below. The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether such Event of Default is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a default under clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) (only with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary) shall not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities notify the Company and the Trustee of the default and the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, does not cure such default within any applicable time specified in clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) hereof after receipt of such notice.
10 If an Event of Default occurs (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all of the outstanding Securities may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Securities and its consequences. 16. Trustee Dealings with the Company Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 17. No Recourse Against Others A director, officer, employee or shareholder, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities. 18. Authentication This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security. 19. Abbreviations Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act). 20. Governing Law THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.

[FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF EXCHANGE SECURITY] 9.00% Senior Note due 2015 1. Interest (a) THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY, an Ohio corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above. The Company shall pay interest semiannually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Interest on the Securities shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from June 23, 2005 until the principal hereof is due. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. (b) Additional Interest--General All references to payments of interest include payments of additional interest, if any. 2. Method of Payment The Company shall pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on the December 15 or June 15 next preceding the interest payment date even if Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company shall pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in money of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company or any successor Depository. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest), at the office of the Paying Agent, except that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided, however, that payments on a Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States of America if such Holder has elected payment by wire transfer by providing written wire instructions to the Trustee or the Paying Agent on or after the Closing Date but, in any event, no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).
2 3. Paying Agent and Registrar Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. 4. Indenture The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of June 23, 2005 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "TIA"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Holders (as defined in the Indenture) are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of such terms and provisions. The Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. This Security is one of the Exchange Securities referred to in the Indenture. The Securities include the Initial Securities and the Exchange Securities issued in exchange for Initial Securities pursuant to the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement. The Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities and all other Securities are treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, among other things, make certain Investments and other Restricted Payments, pay dividends and other distributions, incur Indebtedness, enter into consensual restrictions upon the payment of certain dividends and distributions by such Restricted Subsidiaries, sell assets, including shares of capital stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, enter into or permit certain transactions with Affiliates and create or incur Liens. The Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its property. Following the first day (the "Suspension Date") that (i) the Securities have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.11 and Section 5.01(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants") of the Indenture. In addition, the Company may elect to suspend the Subsidiary Guarantees. Upon and following any Reversion Date, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events and the Subsidiary Guarantees shall be reinstated.
3 5. Guarantee The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium and interest on, the Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Indenture.

Sinking Fund The Securities are not subject to any sinking fund. 8. Notice of Redemption Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at his, her or its registered address. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000.

Discharge and Defeasance Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate some of or all its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of, and interest on the Securities to redemption, or maturity, as the case may be. 14.

Defaults and Remedies An "Event of Default" occurs if: (i) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Security when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for 30 days; (ii) the Company defaults in the payment of principal of any Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption or required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (iii) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 5.01 of the Indenture; (iv) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with Section 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 or 4.12 of the Indenture (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Securities) and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (v) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with its agreements contained in the Securities or the Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (vi) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary under Sections 6.01(7) and (8) of the Indenture; (viii) any final and nonappealable judgment or decree (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) is rendered against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary and such final judgment or decree remains outstanding and is not satisfied, discharged or waived within a period of 60 days following such judgment; or (ix) any Subsidiary Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect in all material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under the Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice specified below. The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether such Event of Default is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.
8 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a default under clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) (only with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary) shall not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities notify the Company and the Trustee of the default and the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, does not cure such default within any applicable time specified in clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default occurs (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all of the outstanding Securities may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Securities and its consequences. 16. Trustee Dealings with the Company Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 17. No Recourse Against Others A director, officer, employee or shareholder, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities. 18. Authentication This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security. 19. Abbreviations Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).

Governing Law THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. 21.

Shelf Registration. (a) In the event that (i) the Company and the Guarantors determine that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not 5
available or may not be completed as soon as practicable after the Exchange Date because it would violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason completed by March 20, 2006 or (iii) upon completion of the Exchange Offer any Initial Purchaser shall so request in connection with any offering or sale of Registrable Securities that were ineligible to be exchanged in the Exchange Offer, the Company and the Guarantors shall, at their own cost, prepare and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be filed as soon as reasonably practicable after such determination, date or request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415 of the Securities Act (the "Shelf Registration") and to have such Shelf Registration Statement declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable by the SEC; provided that the Company and the Guarantors shall not be required to file such Shelf Registration Statement or cause such Shelf Registration Statement to become and stay effective if and when, in the case of clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Exchange Offer Registration is available. In the event that the Company and the Guarantors are required to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company and the Guarantors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file and have declared effective by the SEC both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer. The Company and the Guarantors agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the date that is two years from the date hereof or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the "Shelf Effectiveness Period"). The Company and the Guarantors further agree to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration or if reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective and such Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus to become usable as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. The Company and the Guarantors agree to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities named in the Shelf Registration Statement copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC. (b) The Company and the Guarantors shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the performance by the Company and the Guarantors of their obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each Holder shall pay their own costs and expenses, including all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. 6
(c) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof or a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC. (d) In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, is not declared effective on or prior to March 20, 2006, the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by (x) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following March 20, 2006 and (y) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, up to a maximum of 1.00% per annum of additional interest, until the Exchange Offer is completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, is declared effective by the SEC or the Securities become freely tradable under the Securities Act. If the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 45 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by (x) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following such 45th day of ineffectiveness or lack of usability and (y) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each such subsequent 90-day period of ineffectiveness or lack of usability, up to a maximum of 1.00% per annum of additional interest, commencing on the 45th day in such 12-month period and ending on such date that the Shelf Registration Statement has again been declared effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable. The events described in the preceding two paragraphs are collectively referred to as "Registration Defaults." Upon the cure of all Registration Defaults relating to the Registrable Securities, the accrual of additional interest with respect to the Registrable Securities will cease. In no event shall such additional interest ever be greater than 1.00% per annum. (e) Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge that any failure by the Company or the Guarantors to comply with their obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 3(a) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 3(a) hereof; provided that the Initial Purchasers shall not be entitled to any monetary damages other than the additional interest provided for in this Agreement. 4. Registration Procedures. In connection with their obligations pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 3(a) hereof, the Company and the Guarantors shall as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on the appropriate form under the Securities Act, which form (x) shall be selected by the Company and the Guarantors, (y) shall, in the case of a Shelf Registration, be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the selling Holders thereof and (z) shall comply as to form in all material respects with the 7

any post-effective amendment thereto has been filed and becomes effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC or any state securities authority for amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement and Prospectus or for additional information after the Registration Statement has become effective, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC or any state securities authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) if, between the effective date of a Registration Statement and the closing of any sale of Registrable Securities covered thereby, the representations and warranties of the Company or any Guarantor contained in any underwriting agreement, securities sales agreement or other similar agreement, if any, relating to an offering of such Registrable Securities cease to be true and correct in all material respects, (v) if the Company or any Guarantor receives any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, (vi) of the happening of any event during the period a Registration Statement is effective that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or the related Prospectus untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in such Registration Statement or Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading (vii) of the suspension by the Company, in the exercise of its reasonable judgment, of the use of the Registration Statement or Prospectus in order to avoid premature disclosure of material non-public information, the premature disclosure of which the Company determines, in its good faith judgment, would be harmful to the Company and (viii) of any determination by the Company or any Guarantor, after consultation with counsel, that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement is necessary; (f) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement and the use of any related Prospectus and (ii) the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for offer or sale in any jurisdiction in which they have been qualified for sale, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable, and shall provide notice to each Holder and the Initial Purchasers of the withdrawal of any such orders or suspensions; (g) in the case of a Shelf Registration, furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities, without charge, at least one conformed copy of each Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto (without any documents incorporated therein by reference or exhibits thereto, unless requested); (h) in the case of a Shelf Registration, cooperate with the selling Holders of Registrable Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends and enable such Registrable Securities to be issued in such denominations and registered in such names (consistent with the provisions of the Indenture) as the selling Holders may reasonably request at least five Business Days prior to the closing of any sale of Registrable Securities; (i) in the case of a Shelf Registration or an Exchange Offer Registration, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 4(e)(vi) hereof, use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the 9
Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and the Company and the Guarantors shall notify the Holders of Registrable Securities included in the coverage of the Shelf Registration Statement or the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as the case may be, to suspend use of the Prospectus or as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such an event, and such Holders hereby agree to suspend use of the Prospectus until the Company and the Guarantors have amended or supplemented the Prospectus to correct such misstatement or omission (provided that the provisions of this section shall not otherwise limit the obligation of the Company to pay additional interest pursuant to Section 3(d)); (j) within a reasonable time (but in any event within three Business Days) prior to the filing of any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any amendment to a Registration Statement or amendment or supplement to a Prospectus or of any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or Prospectus after initial filing of a Registration Statement, provide copies of such document to the Initial Purchasers and their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, to the Holders of Registrable Securities included in the coverage of the Shelf Registration Statement and their counsel) and make such of the representatives of the Company and the Guarantors as shall be reasonably requested by the Initial Purchasers or their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, to the Holders of Registrable Securities included in the coverage of the Shelf Registration Statement and their counsel) available for discussion of such document; and the Company and the Guarantors shall not file any Registration Statement, Prospectus, amendment of or supplement to a Registration Statement or a Prospectus, or any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or a Prospectus after initial filing of a Registration Statement, of which the Initial Purchasers and their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders of Registrable Securities included in the coverage of the Shelf Registration Statement and their counsel) shall not have previously been advised and furnished a copy pursuant to this paragraph or to which the Initial Purchasers or their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders of Registrable Securities included in the coverage of the Shelf Registration Statement or their counsel) shall reasonably object within a reasonable period of time after receipt of such documents and in each case after having been afforded the opportunity to discuss such matters with the Company and the Guarantors; (k) obtain a CUSIP number for all Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be, not later than the effective date of a Registration Statement; (l) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act in connection with the registration of the Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be; cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture Act; and execute, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner; (m) in the case of a Shelf Registration, or in the case of an Exchange Offer Registration Statement, with respect to Participating Broker-Dealers that hold Registrable 10
Securities as a result of market-making or other trading activities, make available for inspection by a representative of the Holders of the Registrable Securities included in the coverage of the Shelf Registration Statement (an "Inspector"), any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, and attorneys and accountants (but in any event, only one law firm and one accounting firm to represent the Holders, in each case selected by the Majority Holders and reasonably acceptable to the Company) designated by the Holders, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, all pertinent financial and other records, documents and properties of the Company and the Guarantors, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective officers, directors and employees of the Company and the Guarantors to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement; provided that if any such information is identified by the Company or any Guarantor as being confidential or proprietary, each Person receiving such information shall agree in writing with Company pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in customary form to keep such information confidential. (n) in the case of a Shelf Registration, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities to be reserved for listing on any securities exchange or any automated quotation system on which similar securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any Guarantor are then listed no later than the date such Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective, and, cause all such Registrable Securities to be so listed, in all cases to the extent such Registrable Securities satisfy applicable listing requirements; (o) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, if reasonably requested by any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement, promptly incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect to such Holder as such Holder reasonably requests to be included therein and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment after the Company has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in such filing, amendment or supplement; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to file more than one post-effective amendment or supplement in any 30-day period as a result of any such request; and (p) in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary agreements and take all such other actions reasonably requested by the Holders in connection therewith in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, an Underwritten Offering (if requested by the Majority Holders) and in such connection, use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to the extent possible, make such representations and warranties to the Holders and any Underwriters of such Registrable Securities with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Registration Statement or Prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and confirm the same if and when requested, (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and the Guarantors (which counsel and opinions, in form, scope and substance, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and such Underwriters and their respective counsel) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings, (iii) obtain "comfort" letters from the independent certified public accountants of the Company and the Guarantors (and, if necessary, any other certified public accountant of any subsidiary of the Company or any 11
Guarantor, or of any business acquired by the Company or any Guarantor for which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings and (iv) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Majority Holders of the Registrable Securities being sold or the Underwriters, and which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors made pursuant to clause (i) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement. (q) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and the proposed disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company and the Guarantors may from time to time reasonably request in writing. (r) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, in the event that any broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act shall underwrite any Registrable Securities or participate as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or "assist in the distribution" (within the meaning of the Conduct Rules (the "Rules") of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.) thereof, whether as a Holder of such Registrable Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, the Company will, to the extent requested by such broker-dealer, assist such broker-dealer in complying with the requirements of such Rules, including, without limitation, by (i) if such Rules, including Rule 2720, shall so require, engaging a "qualified independent underwriter" (as defined in Rule 2720) to participate in the preparation of the Shelf Registration Statement relating to such Registrable Securities, to exercise usual standards of due diligence in respect thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by such Shelf Registration Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales agent, to recommend the yield of such Registrable Securities, (ii) indemnifying any such qualified independent underwriter to the extent of the indemnification of underwriters provided in Section 7 hereof and (iii) providing such information to such broker-dealer as is reasonably requested and may be required in order for such broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of the Rules; provided that the Company shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of any such qualified independent underwriter or any expenses incurred by any such broker-dealer in connection with its compliance with the Rules. (s) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and the Guarantors of the happening of any event of the kind described in clauses (ii), (iii), (v), (vii) and (viii) of Section 4(e) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 4(i) hereof and, if so directed by the Company and the Guarantors, such Holder will deliver to the Company and the Guarantors all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice. 12
If the Company and the Guarantors shall give any such notice pursuant to this Section 4(s) or Section 4(i) hereof to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall extend the period during which the Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. Any suspension shall be subject to the applicable increases in the interest rate borne by the Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3(d) hereof. The Company and the Guarantors may not suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities for any of the reasons specified in Section 4(e)(vi) or (vii) for more than 100 days in any 365 day period. 5. Underwritten Offerings. The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering under a Shelf Registration Statement, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering will be selected by the Majority Holders of the Registrable Securities included in such offering, and must be reasonably acceptable to the Company (each an "Underwriter"). 6. Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer. (a) The staff of the SEC has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "Participating Broker-Dealer") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. The staff of the SEC has also taken the position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act. (b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as would otherwise be contemplated by Section 4(i), if requested by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 6(a) above, for the period equal to the lesser of (i) 180 days after the Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 4 of this Agreement) and (ii) the date on which all such Participating Broker-Dealers have sold all such Exchange Securities held by them. Each such Participating Broker-Dealer agrees to promptly notify the Company when all such Exchange Securities have been sold by such Participating Broker-Dealer. The 13
Company and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 6. (c) The Participating Broker-Dealers shall be indemnified by the Company and the Guarantors with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 6(b) above. 7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit, action, proceeding, investigation, any claim asserted or appeal taken from the foregoing, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except (i) insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or any Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Initial Purchaser or such Holder expressly for use therein and (ii) with respect to any untrue statement in or omission from any preliminary prospectus relating to a Registration Statement, the indemnity agreement contained in the paragraph (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder to the extent that a Prospectus relating to such Securities was required to be delivered by such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer under the Securities Act and any such loss, claim, damage or liability results from the fact that (x) a copy of the Prospectus was not sent or given to such Person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such Person and (y) the untrue statement in or omission from such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the final Prospectus unless, in either case, such failure to deliver the Prospectus was a result of non-compliance by the Company with the provisions of this Agreement. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 5, the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement. (b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, their respective affiliates, the directors of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged 14
untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or any Prospectus. (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person, and such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Company; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, and such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Company. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by Citibank Global Markets Inc. and be reasonably acceptable to the Company, (y) for any Holder, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and be reasonably acceptable to the Company and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph (and shall be entitled to such reimbursement pursuant to the provisions hereof), the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding 15
effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person. (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 16
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity. (g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder, their respective affiliates or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors, their respective affiliates or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement. 8. General. (a) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company and the Guarantors represent, warrant and agree that (i) the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of any other outstanding securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any Guarantor under any other agreement and (ii) neither the Company nor any Guarantor has entered into, or on or after the date of this Agreement will enter into, any agreement that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. (b) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company and the Guarantors have obtained the written consent of the Majority Holders affected by such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent; provided that no amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent to any departure from the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall be effective as against any Holder of Registrable Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder, except for any such amendments, modifications, supplements or waivers that would not adversely effect such Holder in any respect. Any amendments, modifications, supplements, waivers or consents pursuant to this Section 8(b) shall be by a writing executed by each of the parties hereto. (c) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, registered first-class mail, telex, telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery (i) if to any Holder, at the most current address of such Holder maintained by the Trustee under the Indenture (provided that while the Securities are in book-entry form, notice to the Trustee shall serve as notice to the Holders); (ii) if to the Company and the Guarantors, initially at the Company's address set forth in the Purchase Agreement and thereafter at such other address, notice of which is given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8(c); and (iii) to such other persons at their respective addresses as provided in the Purchase Agreement and thereafter at such other address, notice of which is given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8(c). All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if 17
personally delivered; five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next Business Day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. Copies of all such notices, demands or other communications shall be concurrently delivered by the Person giving the same to the Trustee, at the address specified in the Indenture. (d) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Registrable Securities in violation of the terms of the Purchase Agreement or the Indenture. If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Registrable Securities in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof. The Initial Purchasers (in their capacity as Initial Purchasers) shall have no liability or obligation to the Company or the Guarantors with respect to any failure by a Holder to comply with, or any breach by any Holder of, any of the obligations of such Holder under this Agreement. (e) Purchases and Sales of Securities. The Company and the Guarantors shall not, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their affiliates (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) not to, purchase and then resell or otherwise transfer any Registrable Securities. (f) Third Party Beneficiaries. Each Holder shall be a third party beneficiary to the agreements made hereunder between the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it deems such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of other Holders hereunder. (g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. (h) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, are not a part of this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. (i) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS. (j) Miscellaneous. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all oral statements and prior writings with respect thereto. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable or against public 18
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. The Company, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions. 19
