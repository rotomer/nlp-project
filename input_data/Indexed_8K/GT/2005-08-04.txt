EXHIBIT 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     AKRON, Ohio, August 4, 2005  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company today reported net income of $69 million (34 cents per share) for the second quarter of 2005, reflecting record sales and increased unit volume. In the second quarter of 2004, the company had net income of $30 million (17 cents per share). All per share amounts are diluted.
     Sales of $5 billion were a record for any quarter, and a 10 percent increase from $4.5 billion during the 2004 period. The increase reflects improved pricing, product mix and volume, as well as the favorable impact of currency translation.
     Tire unit volume in the second quarter of 2005 was 56.4 million units, up from 55.0 million units in the 2004 period. Volume increases were driven by gains in the European, Latin American and Asia/Pacific markets.
     "Five of our businesses had record second quarter sales, and margins improved in our North American and European Union tire businesses," said Robert J. Keegan, Goodyear chairman and chief executive officer. "This success is further evidence that our strategies are working, and that our unwavering focus on key products, customers and markets is paying off. We continue to gain share in targeted markets," he said.
 
     "We have been successful in offsetting the impact of record high raw material costs through strategic pricing actions and by driving product mix enhancement. We will continue to concentrate on these areas to address the inevitable raw material cost increases that we expect in the second half of 2005," Keegan added.
     Raw material costs increased by approximately $133 million during the quarter, compared to a year ago. The company said it expects raw material costs to grow by approximately 10 percent for the full year of 2005 compared to 2004.
     The company estimates the effects of currency translation had a positive net impact on 2005 second quarter sales of approximately $108 million.
     The second quarter of 2005 includes net after-tax charges of $47 million (23 cents per share) related to financing fees, and $7 million (3 cents per share) primarily related to the settlement of prior-years tax liabilities. The quarter also included after-tax gains of $19 million (9 cents per share) from a previously disclosed environmental insurance settlement, $6 million (2 cents per share) related to fire loss recoveries, $5 million (2 cents per share) in net rationalization reversals, and $8 million (4 cents per share) related to general and product liability  discontinued products.
     The second quarter of 2005 also included $8 million (4 cents per share) in after-tax expense relating to prior periods.
     The 2004 second quarter included after-tax rationalization charges of $9 million (5 cents per share) and an after-tax charge of $9 million (5 cents per share) related to external professional fees associated with the previously disclosed accounting investigation, and
     $8 million (5 cents per share) related to general and product liability  discontinued products.
     The company anticipates continued year-over-year gains in operating performance during the second half of 2005, however the rate of those gains is expected to be less than they were in the first half.
Business Segments
     Second quarter total segment operating income was $316 million, an increase of 24 percent compared to $254 million in the 2004 period. All of Goodyear's tire businesses reported higher segment operating income compared to the year-ago period.
     See the note at the end of this release for further explanation and a reconciliation table.
 
     North American Tire sales reached a record for any quarter, increasing 6 percent compared to the 2004 period. The increase was driven by improved pricing and product mix, and higher volume in the consumer replacement and commercial original equipment markets. These increases were offset by an 8 percent decrease in shipments to consumer OE customers, reflecting a slowdown in the U.S. automotive industry and Goodyear's selective fitment strategy in this market.
     Second quarter segment operating income increased 34 percent compared to the 2004 period due to improved pricing and product mix, lower manufacturing costs and higher chemical and off-highway sales partially offset by higher raw material costs of approximately $75 million.
     European Union Tire sales were a second quarter record and increased 11 percent over the 2004 quarter as a result of strong price and product mix, volume increases driven by the consumer replacement and commercial OE markets, and a favorable impact from currency translation of approximately $26 million.
     Segment operating income increased 49 percent to a second quarter record primarily due to improved pricing and product mix, which offset higher raw material costs of approximately $11 million compared to the year-ago period.
 
     Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire's sales were up 14 percent and a second quarter record. The increase resulted from the favorable impact of currency translation, estimated at $12 million, improved volume, and price and product mix related to growth in replacement markets, price increases in emerging markets and continued growth in premium brands.
     Segment operating income improved 9 percent, reaching a second-quarter record due to improved pricing and product mix, foreign currency translation of approximately $7 million, and strong volume. Higher raw material costs of approximately $7 million had a negative impact on results.
     Latin American Tire sales increased 31 percent from the second quarter of 2004 due to higher volume, price increases and improved product mix, as well as the favorable impact of currency translation of approximately $37 million. Sales were the highest for any second quarter in the last seven years.
     Segment operating income was a second quarter record, and a 26 percent increase from 2004 due to improved pricing and product mix, volume and approximately $15 million in favorable currency translation, resulting from certain currency revaluations. Higher raw material costs of approximately $20 million had a negative impact on segment operating income.
     Asia/Pacific Tire sales were a record for any quarter and 12 percent higher than the 2004 quarter due primarily to favorable currency translation of approximately $21 million, and higher volume, particularly in OE markets.
 
     Segment operating income increased 18 percent in the 2005 quarter, reaching a record for any quarter due to improved pricing and product mix, which partially offset raw material cost increases of $13 million.
     Engineered Products' sales in the second quarter of 2005 were a record for any quarter and increased 16 percent compared to the 2004 period as a result of higher volume, mainly in the industrial channel, and the favorable effect of currency translation of approximately $11 million.
     Segment operating income decreased 9 percent due primarily to higher raw material costs of approximately $6 million, and higher administrative and manufacturing costs.
Year-to-Date Results
     Sales for the first six months of 2005 were a record $9.8 billion, an increase of 11 percent from $8.8 billion in the 2004 period. Tire unit volume was 112.3 million units, up from 110.7 million units a year ago.
     Net income for the first six months of 2005 was $137 million (69 cents per share), compared to a loss of $48 million (28 cents per share) during the year-ago period.
     Total segment operating income was $608 million in the first half of 2005, an increase of 40 percent from $435 million in the first six months of 2004.
     First-half 2005 raw material costs increased approximately $252 million compared to the year-ago period.
     In addition to the items listed for the second quarter, the first six months of 2005 includes net after-tax gains of $7 million (3 cents per share) from reversals of rationalization charges, and net after-tax charges of $12 million (6 cents per share) related to general and product liability  discontinued products.
 
     In addition to items listed for the second quarter of 2004, the first six months of that year also included the following after-tax items: a rationalization charge of $20 million (11 cents per share); a charge of $15 million (9 cents per share) related to external professional fees associated with the previously disclosed accounting investigation; an expense of $12 million (7 cents per share) relating primarily to a fire at a European tire manufacturing facility and $4 million (2 cents per share) for accelerated depreciation primarily related to the closure of a Latin American tire manufacturing facility.

Total Segment Operating Income Reconciliation Table
Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by the company's strategic business units ("SBUs") and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for internal performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBU's segment operating income as determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."
