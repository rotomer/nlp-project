FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
#23247fi.106
AKRON, Ohio, January 30, 2006  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company will report fourth quarter 2005 financial results prior to market open Thursday, February 16, to be followed by an investor conference call at 10 a.m. EST.
The company said it anticipates record sales of almost $20 billion for the full year and more than $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter. It expects 2005 segment operating income to be up between 20 and 25 percent from 2004. Excluding the impact of hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, fourth quarter segment operating income is expected to approximate the
$238 million achieved in the prior year period. (See the company's May 3, 2005 Form 8-K for details.)
Goodyear said raw material costs increased approximately 13 percent for the fourth quarter, more than it had anticipated. Consistent with its plans to focus on its cash and working capital requirements, Goodyear reduced global tire inventories through production adjustments during the quarter, particularly in Europe and Latin America.
"Our strong 2005 results show the impact of Goodyear's innovative new products around the world and improved marketing and give us a solid foundation for the next stage of our turnaround," said Robert J. Keegan, chairman and chief executive officer.
"During the quarter, global product demand, including that for new Goodyear tires such as Assurance in North America and Ultra Grip 7 in Europe, remained strong and continued to drive a richer product mix," he said.

"We are working worldwide to reduce our costs and working capital needs, as well as to further improve our product and brand mix," Keegan added. "Nevertheless, the escalating cost of raw materials and currency fluctuations continue to challenge our businesses."
Participating in the conference call will be Keegan; Richard J. Kramer, executive vice president and chief financial officer; and Darren R. Wells, senior vice president, business development and treasurer. They will review Goodyear's fourth quarter and full-year results.
Prior to the commencement of the call, the company will post the financial and other statistical information that will be presented on its investor relations Web site: investor.goodyear.com.
