On March 29, 2006, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company ("Goodyear" or the "Company") announced that the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has terminated its investigation into accounting matters included in Goodyear's restatement of financial results, which was announced in October 2003, and in subsequent public filings. The staff notified Goodyear that it will not recommend enforcement action against the Company. Goodyear also announced that it was informed that the staff has also terminated its investigation and will not recommend enforcement action against Goodyear's former chief financial officer and former chief accounting officer.
