Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On March 31, 2006, in connection with its efforts to extend and enhance its turnaround strategy and reduce high-cost manufacturing capacity, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the "Company") initiated plans to close its European Union Tire Segments Washington passenger tire manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. The Company expects to be substantially complete with the intended closure of the Washington facility by the end of the second quarter of 2006 and estimates the charges associated with the intended closure to be between $75 million and $85 million ($55 million and $65 million after-tax), of which between $35 million to $40 million is expected to be cash charges primarily related to severance payments and between $40 million and $45 million will be related to accelerated depreciation charges. The charges associated with the intended closure are expected to be between $30 million to $35 million ($20 million to $25 million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2006 and between $45 million to $50 million ($35 million to $40 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2006. When complete, the closure of the Washington facility is expected to generate annual cost savings of approximately $20 million. The Company has also initiated other restructuring actions, including the closure of retail stores in the European Union segment, the reduction of headcount within various segments and the closure of its bicycle tire and tube production facility in Debica, Poland. As a result of these actions as well as the intended closure of the Washington, U.K. facility, the Company expects to record total restructuring charges of between $105 million and $115 million (between $75 million and $85 million after-tax), of which $60 million to $65 million will be cash charges, primarily for severance payments and between $45 million and $50 million will be related to accelerated depreciation charges. Charges of approximately $55 million ($40 million after-tax) will be recognized in the first and second qua rters of 2006. The Company expects these actions will eliminate about 1,500 positions and generate annual cost savings of between $40 million and $50 million ($30 million to $40 million after-tax). All after-tax amounts presented in this Current Report on Form 8-K are also after minority interest.
