Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On June 29, 2006, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the "Company") announced that its South Pacific Tyres business had initiated consultation with its associates and union representatives regarding a proposal to close a tire manufacturing facility in Upper Hutt, New Zealand. The facility, which has about 400 associates, produces radial passenger car tires. If implemented, the proposal is expected to be complete within the next six to eight months and estimated charges associated with the intended closure are expected to be approximately $35 million ($35 million after-tax), of which approximately $20 million is expected to be cash charges primarily related to severance payments and approximately $15 million primarily related to accelerated depreciation charges. Charges associated with the proposal are expected to be approximately $15 million ($15 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2006 and approximately $10 million ($10 million after-tax) in each the third and fourth quarters of 2006. The proposa l is expected to generate annual cost savings of approximately $15 million. In addition, the Company has also approved restructuring actions in the European Union business unit to reduce selling, administrative and general expenses. As a result of these actions, the Company expects to record additional cash-related restructuring charges of approximately $20 million ($15 million after-tax), primarily related to severance payments. During the second quarter of 2006, charges of approximately $10 million ($5 million after-tax) will be recognized. The remaining $10 million ($10 million after-tax) of charges will be recognized during the third and fourth quarters of 2006. The Company expects these actions will eliminate about 150 positions and generate annual cost savings of over $10 million. All after-tax amounts presented in this Current Report on Form 8-K are also after minority interest.
