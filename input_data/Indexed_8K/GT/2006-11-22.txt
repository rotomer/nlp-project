ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
(a) Purchase Agreement.
     On November 21, 2006, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company ("Goodyear" or the "Company") completed an offering (the "Offering") of (i) $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.625% Senior Notes due 2011 (the "Fixed Rate Notes"), and (ii) $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2009 (the "Floating Rate Notes", the "Floating Rate Notes" and "Fixed Rate Notes" collectively referred to herein as the "Notes"). The Fixed Rate Notes were sold at par and will bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.625% per annum. The Floating Rate Notes were sold at 99% of the principal amount and will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 375 basis points. In connection with the Offering, Goodyear entered into a purchase agreement, dated as of November 16, 2006 (the "Purchase Agreement"), with Goldman, Sachs & Co. as the initial purchaser of the Notes (the "Initial Purchaser"). The Notes are guaranteed by Goodyear's U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee Goodyear's obligations under its senior secured credit facilities.
     Goodyear expects to receive net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting the Initial Purchaser's discount and offering expenses, of approximately $980 million. Goodyear intends to use the net proceeds (a) to repay at maturity $215 million principal amount of its 6 5/8% Notes due December 1, 2006, (b) to repay at maturity $300 million principal amount of its 8 /% Notes due March 15, 2007 and (c) for other general corporate purposes, which may include addressing the continuing strike by the United Steelworkers union.

     The Notes were offered in a private placement under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The offering and sale of the Notes were not registered under the Securities Act, and the Notes may not be reoffered or resold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
     A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The descriptions of the material terms of the Purchase Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibit.
(b) Indenture and Notes.
     The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of November 21, 2006 (the "Indenture"), among Goodyear, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Indenture provides, among other things, that the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Goodyear and will rank equally with all of the Company's other senior unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Interest is payable on the Notes on June 1 and December 1 of each year beginning on June 1, 2007. The Floating Rate Notes will mature on December 1, 2009 and the Fixed Rate Notes will mature on December 1, 2011. Goodyear may redeem some or all of the Floating Rate Notes at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. After December 1, 2009, Goodyear may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Fixed Rated Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture. Prior to December 1, 2009, Goodyear may redeem for cash some or all of the Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes plus the make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture. In addition, at any time prior to December 1, 2009, Goodyear may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture.
     The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit the ability of Goodyear and certain of its subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of the Goodyear's subsidiaries to pay dividends to Goodyear, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, if the Notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moody's and S&P and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended.
 
     The Indenture provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or other agreements in the Indenture, defaults in failure to pay certain other indebtedness, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all of Notes to be due and payable. In addition, in the event of a change in control, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
     A copy of the Indenture is attached as Exhibit 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The descriptions of the material terms of the Indenture and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibit.
(c) Registration Rights Agreement.
     On November 21, 2006, the Company also entered into separate registration rights agreements with the Initial Purchaser with respect to the Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes (both such agreements referred to herein as the "Registration Rights Agreements"). Under the Registration Rights Agreements, Goodyear agreed for the benefit of the holders of each series of Notes that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and cause to become effective a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange each series of Notes for an issue of registered notes (the "exchange notes") having substantially the same terms as the Notes (except that the exchange notes will not be subject to restrictions on transfer). If an exchange offer cannot be effected, Goodyear has agreed to file and keep effective a shelf registration statement for the resale of the Notes. If the exchange offer for a series of Notes is not completed (or a shelf registration is not declared effective) within 270 days or the Company fails to comply with certain of its other obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement for such series of Notes, the Company will be required to pay additional interest to holders of such Notes.
     Copies of the Registration Rights Agreements are attached as Exhibits 4.3 and 4.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are hereby incorporated by reference herein. The descriptions of the material terms of the Registration Rights Agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibits.

(a) The Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor, jointly and severally, represent and agree that, without the prior consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co., it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that, if the offering of the Securities contemplated by this Agreement were conducted as a public offering pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Act with the Commission, would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433 under the Act (any such offer is hereinafter referred to as a "Company Supplemental Disclosure Document"); (b) the Purchaser represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company, other than one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of securities, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to 13

(a) The Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Purchaser may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Purchaser in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular or any such amendment or supplement, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Purchaser through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein. (b) The Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular or any such amendment or supplement, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Purchaser expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the 16
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchaser on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchaser on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchaser on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Purchaser, in each case as set forth in the Offering Circular. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand or the Purchaser on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Purchaser agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred 17
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Purchaser shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which the Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 16.

"Closing Date" means November 21, 2006. "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. "Company" means the party named as such in this Indenture until a successor replaces it and, thereafter, means the successor and, for purposes of any provision contained herein and required by the TIA, each other obligor on the indenture securities.
5 "Consolidated Coverage Ratio" as of any date of determination means the ratio of: (1) the aggregate amount of EBITDA for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which financial statements have been filed with the SEC to (2) Consolidated Interest Expense for such four fiscal quarters; provided, however, that: (A) if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has Incurred any Indebtedness since the beginning of such period that remains outstanding on such date of determination or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Coverage Ratio is an Incurrence of Indebtedness, EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving effect on a pro forma basis to such Indebtedness as if such Indebtedness had been Incurred on the first day of such period and the discharge of any other Indebtedness repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with the proceeds of such new Indebtedness as if such discharge had occurred on the first day of such period, (B) if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged any Indebtedness since the beginning of such period or if any Indebtedness is to be repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged (in each case other than Indebtedness Incurred under any revolving credit facility unless such Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced) on the date of the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated on a pro forma basis as if such discharge had occurred on the first day of such period and as if the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary had not earned the interest income actually earned during such period in respect of cash or Temporary Cash Investments used to repay, repurchase, defease or otherwise discharge such Indebtedness, (C) if since the beginning of such period the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall have made any Asset Disposition, the EBITDA for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the EBITDA (if positive) directly
6 attributable to the assets that are the subject of such Asset Disposition for such period or increased by an amount equal to the EBITDA (if negative) directly attributable thereto for such period and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Interest Expense directly attributable to any Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with respect to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such Asset Disposition for such period (or, if the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary is sold, the Consolidated Interest Expense for such period directly attributable to the Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary to the extent the Company and its continuing Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer liable for such Indebtedness after such sale), (D) if since the beginning of such period the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise) shall have made an Investment in any Restricted Subsidiary (or any Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) or an acquisition of assets, including any acquisition of assets occurring in connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, which constitutes all or substantially all of an operating unit, division or line of a business, EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the Incurrence of any Indebtedness) as if such Investment or acquisition occurred on the first day of such period, and (E) if since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period shall have made any Asset Disposition or any Investment or acquisition of assets that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (C) or (D) above if made by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary during such period, EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Asset Disposition, Investment or acquisition of assets occurred on the first day of such period. For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition of assets, Asset Disposition or other Investment, the amount of income, EBITDA or

A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery Securities as set forth in Appendix A. The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Securities. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands. SECTION 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent. (a) The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency, where Securities may be presented for payment (the "Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the
36 Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents provided, however, that so long as Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, shall be the Trustee, without the consent of the Trustee, there shall be no more than one Registrar or Paying Agent. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the terms of the TIA. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Company or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary incorporated or organized within The United States of America may act as Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or transfer agent. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, and the Company may require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register transfers or exchanges of Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of Securities to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed, or any Securities for a period of 15 days before an interest payment date. The Holder of a Security may be treated as the owner of such Security for all purposes. (b) The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities and Securities Custodian with respect to the Global Securities. (c) The Company may remove any Registrar or Paying Agent upon written notice to such Registrar or Paying Agent and to the Trustee; provided, however, that no such removal shall become effective until (i) acceptance of an appointment by a successor as evidence by an appropriate agreement entered into by the Company and such successor Registrar or Paying Agent, as the case may be, and delivered to the Trustee or (ii) notification to the Trustee that the Trustee shall serve as Registrar or Paying Agent until the appointment of a successor in accordance with clause (i) above. SECTION 2.04. Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders of Securities of a series or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities of such series and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying
37 with this Section, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. SECTION 2.05. Lists of Holders of Securities. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders of Securities of each series. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date with respect to a series of Securities and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders of Securities of such series. SECTION 2.06. Transfer and Exchange. (a) The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only in compliance with Appendix A and upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer. When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture and Section 8-401(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met. (b) To permit registration of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all taxes, assessments or other governmental charges in connection with any transfer or exchange pursuant to this Section. The Company shall not be required to make and the Registrar need not register transfer or exchanges of Securities selected for redemption in accordance with the terms of this Indenture (except, in the case of Securities to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed or any Securities for a period of 15 days before an interest payment date. Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name a Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (subject to paragraph 2 of the Securities) interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security is overdue, and none of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, or the Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Security shall, by acceptance of such beneficial interest, agree that transfers of beneficial interest in such Global Security may be effected only through a book-entry system maintained by (a) the Holder of such Global Security (or its agent) or (b) any Holder of a beneficial interest in
38 such Global Security, and that ownership of a beneficial interest in such Global Security shall be required to be reflected in a book entry. All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of this Indenture shall evidence the same Indebtedness and shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange. SECTION 2.07. Replacement Securities. If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security. Every replacement Security is an additional Obligation of the Company. The provisions of this Section 2.07 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Securities. SECTION 2.08. Outstanding Securities. Securities of a series outstanding at any time are all Securities of such series authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. Subject to Section 11.06, a Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security. If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser. If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) of a series to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue. SECTION 2.09. Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for
39 temporary Securities upon surrender of such temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company, without charge to the Holder. SECTION 2.10. Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and destroy (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. The Trustee shall not authenticate Securities in place of cancelled Securities other than pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. SECTION 2.11. Defaulted Interest. If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on a series of the Securities, the Company shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) on such series in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest on such series to the persons who are Holders of Securities of such series on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed to each Holder of Securities of such series a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. SECTION 2.12. CUSIP Numbers and ISINs. The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers and ISINs (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers and ISINs in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided, however, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. SECTION 2.13. Issuance of Additional Securities. After the Closing Date, the Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance, at the time of and after giving effect to such issuance, with Section 4.03, to issue Additional Securities of any series under this Indenture, which Securities shall have identical terms as the applicable series of Initial Securities issued on the Closing Date, other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price. All Fixed Rate Securities issued under this Indenture (including any Additional Fixed Rate Securities) shall be treated as a single class for all purposes of this Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver, other modification or optional redemption by the Company. All Floating Rate Securities issued under this Indenture (including any Additional Floating Rate Securities) shall be treated as a single class for all purposes of this Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver, other modification or optional redemption by the Company.
40 The Fixed Rate Securities and the Floating Rate Securities shall be treated as separate classes for all purposes of this Indenture, including in respect of amendments, waivers, other modifications or optional redemptions and the application of, and determination of compliance with, the covenants contained in Article 4 hereof. With respect to any Additional Securities of a series, the Company shall set forth in an Officers' Certificate, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Trustee (along with a copy of the resolutions of the Board of Directors authorizing the Additional Securities of such series), the following information: (1) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture and the provision of Section 4.03 that the Company is relying on to issue such Additional Securities; (2) the series, the issue price, the issue date, the CUSIP number and ISIN of such Additional Securities; provided, however, that no Additional Fixed Rate Securities may be issued at a price that would cause such Fixed Rate Additional Securities to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code and no Additional Floating Rate Securities may be issued at a price that would cause such Floating Rate Securities to have "original issue discount" in excess of the "original issue discount" at which the Initial Floating Rate Securities were issued on the Closing Date; and (3) whether such Additional Securities shall be Initial Securities or shall be issued in the form of Exchange Securities as set forth in Exhibit 1(b) or 2(b), as the case may be. ARTICLE 3 Redemption SECTION 3.01. Notices to Trustee. If the Company elects to redeem Securities of any series pursuant to paragraph 6 of such series of Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the redemption date, the principal amount of such series of Securities to be redeemed and the paragraph of such series of Securities pursuant to which the redemption will occur. The Company shall give each notice to the Trustee provided for in this Section at least 45 days before the redemption date unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period. Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officers' Certificate to the effect that such redemption will comply with the conditions herein. Any such notice may be cancelled by the Company at any time prior to notice of such redemption being mailed to any Holder and shall thereby be void and of no effect unless the Trustee has sent the notice of redemption pursuant to Section 3.03 below. SECTION 3.02. Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed. If fewer than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee, subject to the procedures of DTC, shall select the Securities of such series to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by a
41 method that complies with applicable legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate. The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption. The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal amount of Securities of such series that have denominations larger than $2,000. Securities and portions of them the Trustee selects shall be in principal amounts of $2,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Securities or portions of Securities to be redeemed. SECTION 3.03. Notice of Redemption. At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a date for redemption of Securities of a series, the Company, or the Trustee (at the direction of the Company), shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class mail to each Holder of Securities of such series to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address. The notice shall identify the Securities of such series to be redeemed and shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the redemption price; (3) the name and address of the Paying Agent; (4) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price; (5) if fewer than all the outstanding Securities of such series are to be redeemed, the identification and principal amounts of the particular Securities to be redeemed; (6) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption payment, interest on Securities (or portion thereof) called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date; and (7) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number or ISIN, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Securities. At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense. In such event, the Company shall provide the Trustee with the information required by this Section. SECTION 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is mailed to Holders, Securities of a series called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price stated in the notice.
42 Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date if the redemption date is after a regular record date and on or prior to the interest payment date). Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder. SECTION 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on all Securities of a series or portions thereof to be redeemed on that date other than Securities of such series or portions of Securities of such series called for redemption which have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation. Interest shall cease to accrue on Securities or portions thereof called for redemption on and after the date the Company has deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the Securities to be redeemed, unless the Paying Agent is prohibited from making such payment pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. SECTION 3.06. Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder (at the Company's expense) a new Security equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered. ARTICLE 4 Covenants SECTION 4.01. Payment of Securities. The Company shall promptly pay the principal of and interest on the Securities on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities and in this Indenture. Principal and interest shall be considered paid on the date due if as of 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time on such date the Trustee or the Paying Agent holds in accordance with this Indenture money sufficient to pay all principal and interest then due. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate specified therefor in the Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. SECTION 4.02. SEC Reports. Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall file with the SEC and provide the Trustee and Holders and prospective Holders (upon request) within 15 days after it files them with the SEC, copies of its annual report and the information, documents and other reports that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee and the Holders, promptly upon their becoming available, copies of the annual report to shareholders and any other information provided by the Company to its public
43 shareholders generally. The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of Section 314(a) of the TIA. In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders of the Securities and to prospective investors, upon the requests of such Holders, any information with respect to the Company required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Securities are not freely transferable under the Securities Act. SECTION 4.03. Limitation on Indebtedness. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur, directly or indirectly, any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving effect thereto and the application of the proceeds therefrom the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.0:1.0. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur the following Indebtedness: (1) (x) U.S. Bank Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (A) $3,000,000,000, less the aggregate amount of all prepayments of principal applied to permanently reduce any such Indebtedness in satisfaction of the Company's obligations under Section 4.06 and (B) the sum of (i) 60% of the book value of the inventory of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries plus (ii) 80% of the book value of the accounts receivable of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than any accounts receivable pledged, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction), in each case, as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been filed with the SEC and (y) European Bank Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed E525,000,000; provided, however, that the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) shall be reduced by any amount of Indebtedness Incurred and then outstanding pursuant to the election provision of clause (10)(A)(ii) below; (2) Indebtedness of the Company owed to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owed to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that any subsequent event that results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each
44 case, to constitute the Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the issuer thereof; (3) Indebtedness (A) represented by the Securities issued on the Closing Date (not including any Additional Securities) and the Subsidiary Guarantees, (B) outstanding on the Closing Date (other than the Indebtedness described in clauses (1) and (2) above and clause (12) below), and (C) consisting of Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (3) (including Indebtedness that is Refinancing Indebtedness) or the foregoing paragraph (a); (4) (A) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary Incurred and outstanding on or prior to the date on which such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness Incurred in contemplation of, in connection with, as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Subsidiary of or was otherwise acquired by the Company); provided, however, that on the date that such Restricted Subsidiary is acquired by the Company, (i) the Company would have been able to Incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the foregoing paragraph (a) after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (4) or (ii) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio immediately after giving effect to such Incurrence and acquisition would be greater than such ratio immediately prior to such transaction and (B) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary in respect of Indebtedness Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to this clause (4); (5) Indebtedness (A) in respect of performance bonds, bankers' acceptances, letters of credit and surety or appeal bonds entered into by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business, and (B) Hedging Obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business to hedge risks with respect to the Company's or a Restricted Subsidiary's interest rate, currency or raw materials pricing exposure and not entered into for speculative purposes; (6) Purchase Money Indebtedness, Capitalized Lease Obligations and Attributable Debt and Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof in an aggregate principal amount on the date of Incurrence that, when added to all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (6) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (A) $600,000,000 and (B) 5.0% of Consolidated assets of the
45 Company as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been filed with the SEC; (7) Indebtedness Incurred by a Receivables Entity in a Qualified Receivables Transaction; (8) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of a Financial Officer's becoming aware of its Incurrence; (9) any Guarantee (other than the Subsidiary Guarantees) by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other obligations by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is permitted under the terms of this Indenture (other than Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (4) above); (10) (A) Indebtedness of Foreign Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount that, when added to all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (10)(A) and then outstanding, will not exceed (i) $900,000,000 plus (ii) any amount then permitted to be Incurred pursuant to clause (1) above that the Company instead elects to Incur pursuant to this clause (10)(A); and (B) Indebtedness of Foreign Subsidiaries Incurred in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction in an amount not to exceed E300,000,000 at any one time outstanding; (11) Indebtedness constituting unsecured Indebtedness or Secured Indebtedness in an amount not to exceed $850,000,000 and Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; (12) Indebtedness represented by the Senior Secured Notes and the related Guarantees by Subsidiaries of the Company and Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; and (13) Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount on the date of Incurrence that, when added to all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (13) and then outstanding, will not exceed $150,000,000.
46 (c) For purposes of determining the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this Section 4.03: (1) Outstanding Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any of the Credit Agreements prior to or on the Closing Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of paragraph (b) above; (2) Indebtedness permitted by this Section 4.03 need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness, and (3) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in this Section 4.03, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall classify such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) as of the time of Incurrence and will only be required to include the amount of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses (provided that any Indebtedness originally classified as Incurred pursuant to Sections 4.03(b)(2) through (b)(13) may later be reclassified as having been Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or any other of Sections 4.03(b)(2) through (b)(13) to the extent that such reclassified Indebtedness could be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or one of Sections 4.03(b)(2) through (b)(13), as the case may be, if it were Incurred at the time of such reclassification). (d) For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar or euro denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness where the Indebtedness Incurred is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Indebtedness will be the U.S. Dollar Equivalent or Euro Equivalent, as the case may be, determined on the date of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness; provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to U.S. dollars or euros, as the case may be, covering all principal, premium, if any, and interest payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollars or euros will be as provided in such Currency Agreement. The principal amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being Refinanced will be the U.S. Dollar Equivalent or Euro Equivalent, as appropriate, of the Indebtedness Refinanced determined on the date of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, except to the extent that (1) such U.S. Dollar Equivalent or Euro Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and (2) the principal amount of the Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being Refinanced, in which case the U.S. Dollar Equivalent or Euro Equivalent, as appropriate, of such excess will be determined on the date such Refinancing Indebtedness is Incurred.
47 SECTION 4.04. Limitation on Restricted Payments. (d) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to make any Restricted Payment if at the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes any Restricted Payment: (1) a Default will have occurred and be continuing (or would result therefrom); (2) the Company could not Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under Section 4.03(a); or (3) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments (the amount so expended, if other than in cash, to be determined in good faith by a Financial Officer of the Company, whose determination will be conclusive; provided, however, that with respect to any noncash Restricted Payment in excess of $25,000,000, the amount so expended shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the definition of Fair Market Value) declared or made subsequent to the Reference Date would exceed the sum, without duplication, of: (i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one accounting period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter immediately following the fiscal quarter during which the Reference Date occurs to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been filed with the SEC prior to the date of such Restricted Payment (or, in case such Consolidated Net Income will be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit); (ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company from the issuance or sale of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) subsequent to the Reference Date (other than an issuance or sale to a Subsidiary of the Company and other than an issuance or sale to an employee stock ownership plan or to a trust established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of their employees) and 100% of any cash capital contribution received by the Company from its shareholders subsequent to the Reference Date; (iii) the amount by which Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries is reduced on the Company's Consolidated balance sheet upon the conversion or exchange (other than by a Subsidiary of the Company) subsequent to the Reference Date of any Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries issued after the

SECTION 4.05. Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company; (2) make any loans or advances to the Company; or (3) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company, except: (A) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order or an agreement in effect at or entered into on the Closing Date; (B) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to an agreement relating to any Indebtedness Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary prior to the date on which such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Company (other than Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, in contemplation of, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company) and outstanding on such date; (C) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement effecting a Refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to an agreement referred to in Section 4.05(3)(A) or Section 4.05(3)(B) or this Section 4.05(3)(C) or contained in any amendment to an agreement referred to in Section 4.05(3)(A) or Section 4.05(3)(B) or this Section 4.05(3)(C); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such Refinancing agreement or amendment are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in such predecessor agreements;

52 affect the Company's ability to make principal or interest payments on the Securities, as determined in good faith by a Financial Officer of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive. SECTION 4.06. Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock. (d) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless: (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming sole responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition, (2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Additional Assets; provided, however, that the 75% consideration requirement of this Section 4.06(a)(2) shall not apply to any Specified Asset Sale, and (3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be): (A) first, to the extent the Company elects (or is required by the terms of any applicable Indebtedness) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase, repurchase, redeem, retire, defease or otherwise acquire for value Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor or (ii) to cause any loan commitment that is available to be drawn under the applicable credit facility and to be Incurred under this Indenture and that when drawn would constitute Secured Indebtedness, to be permanently reduced by the amount of Net Available Cash, in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company and other than obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock, within 365 days after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; (B) second, to acquire Additional Assets (or otherwise to make capital expenditures), in each case within 365 days after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; (C) third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with Section 4.06(a)(3)(A) and Section 4.06(a)(3)(B), to make an Offer (as defined in Section 4.06
53 (c)) to purchase Securities pursuant to and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.06(c); provided, however, that if the Company elects (or is required by the terms of any other Senior Indebtedness), such Offer may be made ratably to purchase the Securities and any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and (D) fourth, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with Sections 4.06(a)(3)(A), 4.06(a)(3)(B) and 4.06(a)(3)(C), for any general corporate purpose permitted by the terms of this Indenture; provided, however that in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition for value of Indebtedness pursuant to Section 4.06(a)(3)(A) or Section 4.06(a)(3)(C), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall retire such Indebtedness and shall cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased, repurchased, redeemed, retired, defeased or otherwise acquired for value. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.06(a)(3), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with this Section 4.06 except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions that is not applied in accordance with this Section 4.06 exceeds $25,000,000. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 4.06, such Net Available Cash may be used or invested in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture. (b) For the purposes of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption of Indebtedness or other obligations of the Company (other than obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock of the Company) or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or obligations in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) any Designated Noncash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, does not exceed at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of (1) $200,000,000 and (2) 1.5% of the total Consolidated
54 assets of the Company as shown on the most recent balance sheet of the Company filed with the SEC; (3) securities, notes or similar obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are promptly converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash; and (4) Temporary Cash Investments. (c) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Securities pursuant to Section 4.06(a)(3)(C), the Company shall be required (i) to purchase Securities tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Securities (the "Offer") at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription), set forth in Section 4.06(d) and (ii) to purchase other Senior Indebtedness of the Company on the terms and to the extent contemplated thereby; provided that in no event shall the Company offer to purchase such Senior Indebtedness of the Company at a purchase price in excess of 100% of its principal amount (without premium) or, unless otherwise provided for in such Senior Indebtedness, the accreted amount, if issued with original issue discount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. If the aggregate purchase price of Securities (and Senior Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to the Offer is less than the Net Available Cash allotted to the purchase of the Securities (and other Senior Indebtedness), the Company will apply the remaining Net Available Cash in accordance with Section 4.06(a)(3)(D). The Company shall not be required to make an Offer for Securities (and Senior Indebtedness) pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in Section 4.06(a)(3)(A) and Section 4.06(a)(3)(B)) is less than $25,000,000 for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amount will be carried forward for purposes of determining whether an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). (d) (1) If the aggregate purchase price of Securities (and other Senior Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to the Offer exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company shall select the Securities (and other Senior Indebtedness) to be purchased on a pro rata basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that only Securities and other Senior Indebtedness in denominations of $2,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall be purchased). (2) Promptly, and in any event within 10 days after the Company becomes obligated to make an Offer, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by first-class mail to each Holder, a written notice stating that the Holder may elect to have his Securities purchased by the Company either in whole or in part (subject to prorating as described in Section 4.06(d)(1) in the event the Offer is oversubscribed) in integral multiples of $2,000 of principal amount at the applicable purchase price. The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date").
55 (3) Not later than the date upon which written notice of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided below, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as to (A) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), including information as to any other Senior Indebtedness included in the Offer for repurchase, (B) the allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Dispositions pursuant to which such Offer is being made and (C) the compliance of such allocation with the provisions of Section 4.06(a) and (c). By 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Purchase Date, the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) in Temporary Cash Investments, maturing on the last day prior to the Purchase Date or on the Purchase Date if funds are immediately available by open of business, an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the Offer includes other Senior Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made with any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the Securities or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the Securities delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the Securities, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period for application in accordance with this Section 4.06. (4) Holders electing to have a Security purchased shall be required to surrender the Security, with an appropriate form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date. A Holder shall be entitled to withdraw its election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the Purchase Date, a telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of the Security which was delivered for purchase by such Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Security purchased. Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part shall be issued new Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered. (5) At the time the Company delivers Securities to the Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company shall also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such Securities are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section. A Security shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time the Trustee, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers payment therefor to the surrendering Holder.
56 (e) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Securities pursuant to this Section 4.06. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.06, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 4.06 by virtue thereof. SECTION 4.07. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an "Affiliate Transaction") unless such transaction is on terms: (1) that are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained at the time of such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate, (2) that, in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate amount in excess of $25,000,000, (A) are set forth in writing, and (B) have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors having no personal stake in such Affiliate Transaction and, (3) that, in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $75,000,000, have been determined by a nationally recognized appraisal, accounting or investment banking firm to be fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. (b) The provisions of Section 4.07(a) will not prohibit: (1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be paid pursuant to Section 4.04, (2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans approved by the Board of Directors, (3) the grant of stock options or similar rights to employees and directors of the Company pursuant to plans approved by the Board of Directors,
57 (4) loans or advances to employees in the ordinary course of business of the Company, (5) the payment of reasonable fees and compensation to, or the provision of employee benefit arrangements and indemnity for the benefit of, directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, (6) any transaction between or among any of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any joint venture or similar entity which would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Restricted Subsidiary, joint venture or similar entity, (7) the issuance or sale of any Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, (8) any agreement as in effect on the Closing Date and described in the Private Placement Memorandum or in the Company's SEC filings as filed on or prior to the Closing Date, or any renewals, extensions or amendments of any such agreement (so long as such renewals, extensions or amendments are not less favorable in any material respect to the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries) and the transactions evidenced thereby, (9) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture which are fair to the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party, or (10) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Transaction. SECTION 4.08. Change of Control. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder shall have the right to require the Company to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in accordance with Section 4.08(b). (b) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee (the "Change of Control Offer"), stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such Holder has the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of such Holder's
58 Securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change of Control; (3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); and (4) the instructions determined by the Company, consistent with this Section 4.08, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Securities purchased. (c) The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to a series of Securities upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 4.08 applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Securities of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. In addition, the Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to a series of Securities upon a Change of Control if any such Securities have been called for redemption to the extent that the Company mails a valid notice of redemption to Holders prior to the Change of Control, and thereafter redeems all Securities of such series called for redemption in accordance with the terms set forth in such redemption notice. (d) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Securities pursuant to this Section 4.08. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.08, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 4.08 by virtue thereof. (e) On the purchase date, all Securities purchased by the Company under this Section 4.08 shall be delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall pay the purchase price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Holders entitled thereto. SECTION 4.09. Limitation on Liens. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Incur or permit to exist any Lien (the "Initial Lien") of any nature whatsoever on any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned at the Closing Date or thereafter acquired securing any Indebtedness, other than Permitted Liens, without effectively providing that the Notes shall be secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) the obligations so secured for so long as such obligations are so secured.
59 Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien. SECTION 4.10. Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback Transaction with respect to any property unless: (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to: (A) Incur Indebtedness with respect to such Sale/Leaseback Transaction pursuant to Section 4.03 and (B) create a Lien on such property securing such Indebtedness without equally and ratably securing the Securities pursuant to Section 4.09; (2) the gross proceeds payable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such Sale/Leaseback Transaction are at least equal to the Fair Market Value of such property; and (3) the transfer of such property is permitted by, and, if applicable, the Company applies the proceeds of such transaction in compliance with, Section 4.06. SECTION 4.11. Future Subsidiary Guarantors. The Company shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that Guarantees any Indebtedness of the Company or of any Subsidiary Guarantor to become a Subsidiary Guarantor, and if applicable, execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form set forth in Exhibit 3 hereto pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall Guarantee payment of the Securities. Each Subsidiary Guarantee shall be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be Guaranteed by that Subsidiary Guarantor, without rendering the Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. SECTION 4.12. Suspension of Certain Covenants. (a) Following the first day (the "Suspension Date") that: (1) a series of Securities has an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies, and (2) no Default has occurred and is continuing hereunder with respect to such series of Securities, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.11 and Section 5.01(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants").
60 In addition, the Company may elect to suspend the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to such series of Securities. (b) In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time with respect to a series of Securities as a result of the foregoing and on any subsequent date (the "Reversion Date") one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to such Securities below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to such series of Securities with respect to future events and the Subsidiary Guarantees shall be reinstated with respect to such series of Securities. The period of time between the Suspension Date for such series of Securities and the Reversion Date for such series of Securities is referred to herein as the "Suspension Period." (c) Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated with respect to a series of Securities, no default shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants with respect to such series of Securities during the Suspension Period. During any Suspension Period with respect to a series of Securities, the Company shall not designate any Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary with respect to such series of Securities unless the Company would have been permitted to designate such Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary with respect to such series of Securities if a Suspension Period with respect to such series of Securities had not been in effect for any period. (d) On the Reversion Date with respect to a series of Securities, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period shall be classified to have been Incurred with respect to such series of Securities pursuant to Section 4.03 (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date with respect to such series of Securities and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Period with respect to such series of Securities and outstanding on the Reversion Date with respect to such series of Securities). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or Section 4.03(b), such Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been outstanding on the Closing Date, so that it is classified as permitted under Section 4.03(b)(3)(B). Calculations made after the Reversion Date with respect to a series of Securities of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under Section 4.04 shall be made as though Section 4.04 had been in effect with respect to such series of Securities since the Closing Date and throughout the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period with respect to a series of Securities shall reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments with respect to such series of Securities under Section 4.04(a) and the items specified in Section 4.04(a)(3) shall increase the amount available to be made under Section 4.04(a). For purposes of determining compliance with Section 4.06(a) and Section 4.06(b) with respect to a series of Securities, the Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions not applied in accordance with Section 4.06 shall be deemed to be reset to zero with respect to such series of Securities after the Reversion Date.
61 (e) In addition, without causing a Default or Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may honor any contractual commitments to take actions after a Reversion Date with respect to such series of Securities as long as such contractual commitments were entered into during a Suspension Period with respect to such series of Securities and not in anticipation of such Securities' no longer having an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies. SECTION 4.13. Compliance Certificate. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company an officers' certificate signed by a Financial Officer complying with TIA Section 314(a)(4) stating (i) that a review of the activities of the Company and the Subsidiaries during the preceding fiscal year has been made with a view to determining whether the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors have fulfilled their obligations under this Indenture and (ii) that, to the knowledge of such Financial Officer, no Default or Event of Default occurred during such period (or, if a Default or Event of Default hereunder shall have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default hereunder of which such Financial Officer may have knowledge and what action the Company has taken, is taking and/or proposes to take with respect thereto). SECTION 4.14. Further Instruments and Acts. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purpose of this Indenture.

(a) The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets, in one or a series of related transactions, to, any Person, unless: (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") will be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
62 (3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, (A) the Successor Company would be able to Incur an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness under Section 4.03(a) or (B) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company would be greater than such ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and (4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with this Indenture. (b) The Successor Company shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture, and the predecessor Company, other than in the case of a lease, shall be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Securities. (c) The Company shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets, in or a series of related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) except in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor (i) that has been disposed of in its entirety to another Person (other than to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), whether through a merger, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock or assets or (ii) that, as a result of the disposition of all or a portion of its Capital Stock, ceases to be a Subsidiary, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Guarantor") shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and such Person (if not such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (3) the Company will have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with this Indenture. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) any Restricted Subsidiary may Consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor and
63 (2) the Company may merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction within the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia to realize tax or other benefits. ARTICLE 6 Defaults and Remedies SECTION 6.01. Events of Default. An "Event of Default" occurs with respect to a series of Securities if: (1) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on such series of Securities when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for 30 days; (2) the Company defaults in the payment of principal of any Security of such series when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption or required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (3) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 5.01; (4) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with Section 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 or 4.12 (in each case, other than a failure to purchase such Securities) and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (5) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with its agreements with respect to such Securities contained in this Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (6) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent; (7) the Company or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law: (A) commences a voluntary case; (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case;
64 (C) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property; or (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; (8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (A) is for relief against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case; (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its property; or (C) orders the winding up or liquidation of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; (9) any final and nonappealable judgment or decree (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) is rendered against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary and such final judgment or decree remains outstanding and is not satisfied, discharged or waived within a period of 60 days following such judgment; or (10) any Subsidiary Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect in all material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice specified below. The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default with respect to a series of Securities whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether such Event of Default is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a default under Section 6.01(4), 6.01(5), 6.01(6), 6.01(9) or 6.01(10) (only with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary) shall not constitute an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities until the Trustee notifies the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such series notify the Company and the Trustee of the default and the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, does
65 not cure such default within any applicable time specified in Section 6.01(4), 6.01(5), 6.01(6), 6.01(9) or 6.01(10) hereof after receipt of such notice. The term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, United States Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any Event of Default under Section 6.01(6) or 6.01(10) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under Section 6.01(4), 6.01(5) or 6.01(9), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. SECTION 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or 6.01(8)) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such series by notice to the Company may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities of such series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or 6.01(8) with respect to the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of a series of Securities by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration with respect to such series of Securities and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default with respect to such series of Securities have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto. SECTION 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities of such series or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities of such series or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative. SECTION 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of a series of Securities by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default with respect to such series of Securities and its consequences except (a) a Default
66 in the payment of the principal of or interest on a Security of such series (b) a Default arising from the failure to redeem or purchase any Security of such series when required pursuant to this Indenture or (c) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected. When a Default is waived with respect to a series of Securities, it is deemed cured with respect to such series, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right. SECTION 6.05. Control by Majority. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of a series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Security of such series or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Subject to Section 7.01, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of a series of Securities, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against any loss, liability or expense which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. SECTION 6.06. Limitation on Suits. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Security of a series may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities of such series unless: (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such series make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period. A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder.
67 SECTION 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or 6.01(2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07. SECTION 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. SECTION 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money or property with respect to a series of Securities pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order: FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07 with respect to such series; SECOND: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities of such series for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and THIRD: to the Company. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before such record date, the Company shall mail to each Holder and the Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid. SECTION 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in
68 its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the Securities of a series. SECTION 6.12. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE 7 Trustee SECTION 7.01. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person's own affairs. (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture. (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own wilful misconduct, except that: (1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section; (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
69 (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05. (d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section. (e) (e) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. (f) Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. (g) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (h) Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and to the provisions of the TIA. SECTION 7.02. Rights of Trustee. (a) The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document. (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. (c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care. (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Trustee's conduct does not constitute wilful misconduct or negligence. (e) The Trustee may consult with counsel, and the advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Securities shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel. (f) The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety in respect of the performance of its powers and duties hereunder
70 (g) The Trustee shall not be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any covenants, conditions, or agreements on the part of the Company, except as otherwise set forth herein, but the Trustee may require of the Company full information and advice as to the performance of the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein. (h) The permissive rights of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty and, with respect to such permissive rights, the Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its negligence or willful misconduct; (i) Except for a default under Sections 6.01(1) or (2) hereof, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice or be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer shall have received from the Company or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding written notice thereof at its address set forth in Section 11.02 hereof, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture. In the absence of any such notice, the Trustee may conclusively assume that no Default or Event of Default exists. SECTION 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or co-paying agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11. SECTION 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement of the Company in this Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the sale of the Securities or in the Securities other than the Trustee's certificate of authentication. SECTION 7.05. Notice of Defaults. If a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a Trust Officer, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of the Securities of each series to which such Default applies notice of the Default within the earlier of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any Security (including payments pursuant to the redemption provisions of such Security), the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. SECTION 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. At the expense of the Company, as promptly as practicable after each November 30 beginning with November 30, 2007, and in any event prior to January 1 in each following year, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such November 30 that complies with TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b).
71 A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders of a series shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Securities of such series are listed. The Company agrees to notify promptly the Trustee whenever the Securities of either series become listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof. SECTION 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its services as shall be agreed to in writing from time to time by the Company and the Trustee. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee's agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee, its agents, representatives, officers, directors, employees and attorneys against any and all loss, liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by it in connection with the administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall provide reasonable cooperation in such defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company, provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay such fees and expenses if the Company assumes such defense unless there is a conflict of interest between the Company and the Trustee in connection with such defense as determined by Trustee in consultation with counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own wilful misconduct, negligence or bad faith. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities. The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law. SECTION 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to a series of Securities by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of a series may remove the Trustee with respect to such series by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee with respect to such series. The Company shall remove the Trustee if:
72 (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; (2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; (3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of a series with respect to such series and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee with respect to such series, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee with respect to the applicable series of Securities shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture with respect to the applicable series of Securities. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders of such series of Securities. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee in respect of the applicable series of Securities to the successor Trustee of such series, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the applicable series of Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee for such series of Securities. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, unless the Trustee's duty to resign is stayed as provided in TIA Section 310(b), any Holder of a series of Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to such series of Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such series. Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee. SECTION 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger. If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee. In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of
73 the Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have. SECTION 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA Section 310(a). The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 310(b); provided, however, that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA Section 310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA Section 310(b)(1) are met. SECTION 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated. ARTICLE 8 Discharge of Indenture; Defeasance SECTION 8.01. Discharge of Liability on Securities; Defeasance. (a) When (1) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Securities of a series (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07) for cancellation or (2) all outstanding Securities of a series have become due and payable, whether at maturity or on a redemption date as a result of the mailing of a notice of redemption pursuant to Article 3 hereof and, in the case of clause (2), the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee funds or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Securities of such series, including premium, if any, and interest thereon to maturity or such redemption date (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07), and if in either case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company with respect to such series, then this Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.01(c), cease to be of further effect with respect to such series. Upon satisfaction of the above conditions, the Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such series. (b) Subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.02, the Company at any time may terminate (1) all its obligations under the Securities of a series and this Indenture with respect to any such series of Securities ("legal defeasance option") or (2) its obligations with respect to a series of Securities under Sections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.12 and the operation of Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7),
74 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) and the limitations contained in Section 5.01(a)(3) ("covenant defeasance option"). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option with respect to a series of Securities, payment of the Securities of such series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such series. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to a series of Securities, payment of the applicable series of Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such series specified in Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(a)(3). In the event that the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option with respect to a series of Securities, each Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee of such series. Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates. (c) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 7.07 and 7.08 and in this Article 8 with respect to a series of Securities shall survive until the Securities of such series have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 with respect to such series shall survive. SECTION 8.02. Conditions to Defeasance. The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option with respect to a series of Securities only if: (1) the Company irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee money in U.S. Dollars in an amount sufficient or U.S. Government Obligations, the principal of and interest on which shall be sufficient, or a combination thereof sufficient, to pay the principal of, premium (if any) and interest in respect of the Securities of such series to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Securities of such series to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
75 (3) 91 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 91-day period no Default with respect to such series specified in Sections 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company occurs which is continuing at the end of the period; (4) the deposit does not constitute a default under any other material agreement binding on the Company; (5) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940; (6) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred; and (7) in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and covenant defeasance had not occurred. Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date in accordance with Article 3. SECTION 8.03. Application of Trust Money. The Trustee shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article 8. It shall apply the deposited money and the money from U.S. Government Obligations, as the case may be, through the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of and interest on the applicable series of Securities. SECTION 8.04. Repayment to Company. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly turn over to the Company upon request any excess money or securities held by them at any time. Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter,
76 Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors. SECTION 8.05. Indemnity for Government Obligations. The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against deposited U.S. Government Obligations or the principal and interest received on such U.S. Government Obligations. SECTION 8.06. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's and each Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture with respect to the applicable series of Securities, each Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to such Securities and the Securities of such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 8 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8; provided, however, that, if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Securities of such series because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such series of Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. ARTICLE 9 Amendments SECTION 9.01. Without Consent of Holders. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend this Indenture with respect to a series of Securities or the Securities of such series without notice to or consent of any Holder of such series: (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; (2) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under this Indenture in compliance with Article 5; (3) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities of such series; provided, however, that the uncertificated Securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code or in a manner such that the uncertificated Securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code; (4) to add Guarantees with respect to the Securities of such series or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any such Guarantee with respect to such series when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under this Indenture;
77 (5) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of such series or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company with respect to such series; (6) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of such series in any material respect, subject to the provisions of this Indenture; (7) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with qualifying, or maintaining the qualification of, this Indenture under the TIA; (8) to make any amendment to the provisions of this Indenture relating to form, authentication, transfer and legending of Securities; provided, however, that (A) compliance with this Indenture as so amended would not result in Securities being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (B) such amendment does not materially affect the rights of Holders to transfer Securities; or (9) to provide for the issuance of the Exchange Securities or Additional Securities in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. After an amendment under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section. SECTION 9.02. With Consent of Holders. (a) The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend this Indenture with respect to a series of Securities or the Securities of such series with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for such Securities). Any existing Default or compliance with any provisions of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of a series or such Securities may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding voting as a single class, subject to the restrictions of Section 6.04 and this Section 9.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of each Holder of a series affected thereby, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to such series: (1) reduce the amount of such Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment; (2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any such Security; (3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Security;
78 (4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which such Security may be redeemed pursuant to Article 3 hereto or paragraph 6 of such Securities; (5) make any such Security payable in money other than that stated in such Security; (6) impair the right of any Holder of such Securities to receive payment of principal of, and interest on, such Holder's Securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder's Securities; (7) make any change in Section 6.04 or 6.07 or the second sentence of this Section 9.02; or (8) make any change in, or release other than in accordance with this Indenture, any Subsidiary Guarantee that would adversely affect the Holders of such series of Securities. (b) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders of the applicable series a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section. SECTION 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment to this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect. SECTION 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers. A consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment or waiver with respect to a series of Securities becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder of such series. An amendment or waiver becomes effective upon the execution of such amendment or waiver by the Trustee. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent
79 previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date. SECTION 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment. SECTION 9.06. Trustee To Sign Amendments. The Trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment the Trustee shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it and to receive, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. SECTION 9.07. Payment for Consent. Neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder of a series of Securities for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture with respect to such series of Securities or such Securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all Holders of such series that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. ARTICLE 10 Subsidiary Guarantees SECTION 10.01. Guarantees. (a) Each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment and performance of all of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series of Securities, jointly with the other Subsidiary Guarantors of such series and severally. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors of a series of Securities further agrees that its Guaranteed Obligations with respect to such series of Securities may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any such Guaranteed Obligation. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors of a series of Securities waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor of such series of any of its Guaranteed Obligations with respect to
80 such series of Securities, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee, notice of protest for nonpayment and all similar formalities. (b) Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors of a series of Securities further agrees that its guarantee of such series hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Trustee or any Holder of such series to any security held for the payment of its Guaranteed Obligations with respect to such series or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Trustee or any Holder of such series in favor of the Company. (c) Except for termination of a Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations with respect to a series of Securities hereunder or a release of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series pursuant to Section 10.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Trustee or any Holder of such series to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of this Indenture with respect to such series or otherwise; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Indenture or any other agreement with respect to such series, including with respect to any other Subsidiary Guarantor under this Agreement; (iii) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series; or (iv) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor with respect to such series). (d) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor of such series or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor of such series, other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series. The Trustee may, at its election, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations with respect to a series of Securities, make any other accommodation with the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor of such series or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor of such series, in each case without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Subsidiary Guarantor of such series hereunder except to the
81 extent the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series have been fully and indefeasibly paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Subsidiary Guarantor of a series of Securities waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Subsidiary Guarantor against the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor of such series, as the case may be. (e) Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors of a series of Securities agrees that its guarantee with respect to such series hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to such series is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, any other Subsidiary Guarantor of such series or otherwise. SECTION 10.02. Limitation on Liability. Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to a series of Securities shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. SECTION 10.03. Successors and Assigns. This Article 10 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the successors, transferees and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture. SECTION 10.04. No Waiver. Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 10 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 10 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. SECTION 10.05. Modification. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 10, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
82 SECTION 10.06. Release of Subsidiary Guarantor. A Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this Article 10 (other than any obligation that may have arisen under Section 10.07): (1) upon the sale (including any sale pursuant to any exercise of remedies by a holder of Indebtedness of the Company or of such Subsidiary Guarantor) or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (2) upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor; (3) upon the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, (4) unless there is then existing an Event of Default, at such time and for so long as any such Subsidiary Guarantor that became a Subsidiary Guarantor after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 4.11 does not Guarantee any Indebtedness that would have required such Subsidiary Guarantor to enter into a Supplemental Indenture pursuant to Section 4.11 and the Company provides an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee certifying that no such Guarantee is outstanding and the Company elects to have such Subsidiary Guarantor released from this Article 10, or (5) at any time during a Suspension Period with respect to a series of Securities if the Company provides an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee stating that the Company elects to have such Subsidiary Guarantor released from this Article 10 with respect to such series, or (6) upon the exercise by the Company of its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option with respect to a series of Securities or if the Obligations of the Company under the Indenture with respect to a series of Securities and such Securities are discharged pursuant to Article 8; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (1) and (2) above, (i) such sale or other disposition is made to a Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) such sale or disposition is otherwise permitted by this Indenture and (iii) the Company complies with its obligations under Section 4.06. At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release. SECTION 10.07. Contribution. Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes a payment under its Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to a series of Securities shall be entitled upon payment in full of all Guaranteed Obligations under this Indenture with respect to such series to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor of such series in an amount equal to such other Subsidiary Guarantor's pro rata portion of such
83 payment based on the respective net assets of all the Subsidiary Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. ARTICLE 11 Miscellaneous SECTION 11.01. Trust Indenture Act Controls.

Also, subject to the foregoing, only Securities outstanding at the time shall be considered in any such determination.
85 SECTION 11.07. Rules by Trustee, Paying Agent and Registrar. The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by or a meeting of Holders.

Interest (a) THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY, an Ohio corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Fixed Rate Security at the rate per annum shown above. The Company shall pay interest semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Interest on the Fixed Rate Securities shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from November 21, 2006 until the principal hereof is due. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Fixed Rate Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. (b) Additional Interest--Registration. The Holder of this Fixed Rate Security is entitled to the benefits of a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of November 21, 2006, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and certain purchasers of the Fixed Rate Securities named therein (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Capitalized terms used in this paragraph (b) but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Registration Rights Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Registration Default, the Company shall notify the Trustee of such Registration Default and pay additional interest to each Holder of Registrable Securities, during the period of such Registration Default in such amounts and subject to such limitations as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. All accrued additional interest shall be paid to Holders in the same manner as interest payments on the Fixed Rate Securities on semi-annual payment dates which correspond to interest payment dates for the Fixed Rate Securities. Following the cure of all outstanding Registration Defaults, the accrual of additional interest shall cease. The Trustee shall have no responsibility with respect to the determination of the amount of any such additional interest. (c) Additional Interest--General All references to payments of interest include payments of additional interest, if any. 2. Method of Payment The Company shall pay interest on the Fixed Rate Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on the May 15 or November 15 next preceding the interest payment date even if Fixed Rate Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company shall pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in money of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Fixed Rate Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company or any successor Depository. The Company will make all
4 payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest), at the office of the Paying Agent, except that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided, however, that payments on a Fixed Rate Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States of America if such Holder has elected payment by wire transfer by providing written wire instructions to the Trustee or the Paying Agent on or after the Closing Date but, in any event, no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion). 3. Paying Agent and Registrar Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. 4. Indenture The Company issued the Fixed Rate Securities under an Indenture dated as of November 21, 2006 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Fixed Rate Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "TIA"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Fixed Rate Securities are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Holders (as defined in the Indenture) are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of such terms and provisions. The Fixed Rate Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. This Fixed Rate Security is one of the Initial Securities referred to in the Indenture. The Fixed Rate Securities include the Initial Fixed Rate Securities and any Fixed Rate Exchange Securities issued in exchange for Initial Fixed Rate Securities pursuant to the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement. The Initial Fixed Rate Securities, any Fixed Rate Exchange Securities and all other Fixed Rate Securities are treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, among other things, make certain Investments and other Restricted Payments, pay dividends and other distributions, incur Indebtedness, enter into consensual restrictions upon the payment of certain dividends and distributions by such Restricted Subsidiaries, sell assets, including shares of capital stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, enter into or permit certain transactions with Affiliates and create or incur Liens. The Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its property. Following the first day (the "Suspension Date") that (i) the Fixed Rate Securities have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06,
5 4.07, 4.11 and Section 5.01(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants") of the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities. In addition, the Company may elect to suspend the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities. Upon and following any Reversion Date, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities with respect to future events and the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities shall be reinstated. 5. Guarantee The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium and interest on, the Fixed Rate Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Indenture. The precise terms of the Guarantee of the Fixed Rate Securities and the Guaranteed Obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities are expressly set forth in Article 10 of the Indenture. 6. Optional Redemption Except as set forth below in this paragraph 6 the Company will not be entitled to redeem the Fixed Rate Securities. After December 1, 2009, the Company may redeem the Fixed Rate Securities, in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing on December 1 of the years set forth below: In addition, prior to December 1, 2009, the Company may, on one or more occasions, redeem up to a maximum of 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Securities (calculated giving effect to any issuance of Additional Fixed Rate Securities) with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings by the Company, at a redemption price equal to 108.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that (1) at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Securities (calculated giving effect to any issuance of Additional Fixed Rate Securities) remains outstanding after giving effect to any such redemption and (2) any such redemption by the Company is made within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering and is made in accordance with certain procedures set forth in the Indenture.
6 In addition, prior to December 1, 2009, the Company may at its option redeem the Fixed Rate Securities, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Securities plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Notice of such redemption must be mailed by first-class mail to each Holder's registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. "Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a Fixed Rate Security at any redemption date, the greater of (1) 1.00% of the principal amount of such Security and (2) the excess of (A) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Fixed Rate Security on December 1, 2009 (such redemption price being described in the first paragraph in this section exclusive of any accrued interest), plus (ii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Fixed Rate Security through December 1, 2009 (but excluding accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Adjusted Treasury Rate, over (B) the principal amount of such note on such redemption date. "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after December 1, 2009, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date, in each case calculated on the third Business Day immediately preceding the redemption date, in each case of (1) and (2), plus 0.50%. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Fixed Rate Securities from the redemption date to December 1, 2009, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of U.S. Dollar denominated corporate debt securities of a maturity most nearly equal to December 1, 2009. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, if clause (2) of the Adjusted Treasury Rate is applicable, the average of three, or if not possible, such lesser number as is obtained by the Company, Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date.
7 "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its successors and assigns and two other nationally recognized investment banking firms selected by the Company that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding such redemption date. 7. Sinking Fund The Fixed Rate Securities are not subject to any sinking fund. 8. Notice of Redemption Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Fixed Rate Securities to be redeemed at his, her or its registered address. Fixed Rate Securities in denominations larger than $2,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $2,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest on all Fixed Rate Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Fixed Rate Securities (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 9. Repurchase of Securities at the Option of Holders Upon a Change of Control, any Holder of Fixed Rate Securities will have the right, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture, to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Fixed Rate Securities of such Holder at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. In accordance with Section 4.06 of the Indenture, the Company will be required to offer to purchase Fixed Rate Securities upon the occurrence of certain events. 10. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange The Fixed Rate Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Fixed Rate Securities in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer
8 or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Fixed Rate Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Fixed Rate Securities for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Fixed Rate Securities to be redeemed or for a period of 15 days prior to an interest payment date. 11. Persons Deemed Owners Except as provided in paragraph 2 hereof, the registered Holder of this Fixed Rate Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 12. Unclaimed Money If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors and the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further liability with respect to such monies. 13. Discharge and Defeasance Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate some of or all its obligations under the Fixed Rate Securities and the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of, and interest on the Fixed Rate Securities to redemption, or maturity, as the case may be. 14. Amendment, Waiver Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities or the Fixed Rate Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all of the Fixed Rate Securities then outstanding voting as a single class and (ii) any Default with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all of the Fixed Rate Securities then outstanding voting as a single class. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder of Fixed Rate Securities, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities or the Fixed Rate Securities (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; (ii) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture in compliance with Article 5 of the Indenture; (iii) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; (iv) to add Guarantees with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any such Guarantee or security with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities when such release, termination or discharge is permitted

Defaults and Remedies An "Event of Default" with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities occurs if: (i) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Fixed Rate Security when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for 30 days; (ii) the Company defaults in the payment of principal of any Fixed Rate Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption or required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (iii) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 5.01 of the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities; (iv) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with Section 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 or 4.12 of the Indenture (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Securities) with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (v) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with its agreements contained in the Fixed Rate Securities or the Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above) with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (vi) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary under Sections 6.01(7) and (8) of the Indenture; (viii) any final and nonappealable judgment or decree (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) is rendered against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary and such final judgment or decree remains outstanding and is not satisfied, discharged or waived within a period of 60 days following such judgment; or (ix) any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities ceases to be in full force and effect in all material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under the Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice specified below. The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether such Event of Default is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by
10 operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a default under clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) (only with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary) shall not constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities until the Trustee notifies the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Fixed Rate Securities notify the Company and the Trustee of the default and the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, does not cure such default within any applicable time specified in clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities occurs (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all of the outstanding Fixed Rate Securities may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Fixed Rate Securities to be due and payable. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Fixed Rate Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Fixed Rate Securities may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Securities and its consequences. 16. Trustee Dealings with the Company Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Fixed Rate Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 17. No Recourse Against Others A director, officer, employee or shareholder, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Fixed Rate Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Fixed Rate Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Fixed Rate Securities. 18. Authentication This Fixed Rate Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security. 19. Abbreviations
11 Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act). 20. Governing Law THIS FIXED RATE SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. 21.

No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Fixed Rate Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest), at the office of the Paying Agent, except that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided, however, that payments on a Fixed Rate Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States of America if such Holder has elected payment by wire transfer by providing written wire instructions to the Trustee or the Paying Agent on or after the Closing Date but, in any event, no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).
2 3. Paying Agent and Registrar Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. 4. Indenture The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of November 21, 2006 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Fixed Rate Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "TIA"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Fixed Rate Securities are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Holders (as defined in the Indenture) are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of such terms and provisions. The Fixed Rate Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. This Fixed Rate Security is one of the Fixed Rate Exchange Securities referred to in the Indenture. The Fixed Rate Securities include the Initial Fixed Rate Securities and the Fixed Rate Exchange Securities issued in exchange for Initial Fixed Rate Securities pursuant to the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement. The Initial Fixed Rate Securities, the Fixed Rate Exchange Securities and all other Fixed Rate Securities are treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, among other things, make certain Investments and other Restricted Payments, pay dividends and other distributions, incur Indebtedness, enter into consensual restrictions upon the payment of certain dividends and distributions by such Restricted Subsidiaries, sell assets, including shares of capital stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, enter into or permit certain transactions with Affiliates and create or incur Liens. The Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its property. Following the first day (the "Suspension Date") that (i) the Fixed Rate Securities have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.11 and Section 5.01(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants") of the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities. In addition, the Company may elect to suspend the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities. Upon and following any Reversion Date, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to the Fixed
3 Rate Securities with respect to future events and the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities shall be reinstated. 5. Guarantee The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium and interest on, the Fixed Rate Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Indenture. The precise terms of the Guarantee of the Fixed Rate Securities and the Guaranteed Obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities are expressly set forth in Article 10 of the Indenture. 6. Optional Redemption Except as set forth below in this paragraph 6 the Company will not be entitled to redeem the Fixed Rate Securities. After December 1, 2009, the Company may redeem the Fixed Rate Securities, in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing on December 1 of the years set forth below: In addition, prior to December 1, 2009, the Company may, on one or more occasions, redeem up to a maximum of 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Securities (calculated giving effect to any issuance of Additional Fixed Rate Securities) with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings by the Company, at a redemption price equal to 108.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that (1) at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Securities (calculated giving effect to any issuance of Additional Fixed Rate Securities) remains outstanding after giving effect to any such redemption and (2) any such redemption by the Company is made within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering and is made in accordance with certain procedures set forth in the Indenture.
4 In addition, prior to December 1, 2009, the Company may at its option redeem the Fixed Rate Securities, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Securities plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Notice of such redemption must be mailed by first-class mail to each Holder's registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. "Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a Fixed Rate Security at any redemption date, the greater of (1) 1.00% of the principal amount of such Security and (2) the excess of (A) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Fixed Rate Security on December 1, 2009 (such redemption price being described in the first paragraph in this section exclusive of any accrued interest), plus (ii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Fixed Rate Security through December 1, 2009 (but excluding accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Adjusted Treasury Rate, over (B) the principal amount of such note on such redemption date. "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after December 1, 2009, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date, in each case calculated on the third Business Day immediately preceding the redemption date, in each case of (1) and (2), plus 0.50%. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Fixed Rate Securities from the redemption date to December 1, 2009, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of U.S. Dollar denominated corporate debt securities of a maturity most nearly equal to December 1, 2009. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, if clause (2) of the Adjusted Treasury Rate is applicable, the average of three, or if not
5 possible, such lesser number as is obtained by the Company, Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date. "Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its successors and assigns and two other nationally recognized investment banking firms selected by the Company that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding such redemption date. 7. Sinking Fund The Fixed Rate Securities are not subject to any sinking fund. 8. Notice of Redemption Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Fixed Rate Securities to be redeemed at his, her or its registered address. Fixed Rate Securities in denominations larger than $2,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $2,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest on all Fixed Rate Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Fixed Rate Securities (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 9. Repurchase of Securities at the Option of Holders Upon a Change of Control, any Holder of Fixed Rate Securities will have the right, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture, to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Fixed Rate Securities of such Holder at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. In accordance with Section 4.06 of the Indenture, the Company will be required to offer to purchase Fixed Rate Securities upon the occurrence of certain events.
6 10. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange The Fixed Rate Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Fixed Rate Securities in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Fixed Rate Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Fixed Rate Securities for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Fixed Rate Securities to be redeemed or for a period of 15 days prior to an interest payment date. 11. Persons Deemed Owners Except as provided in paragraph 2 hereof, the registered Holder of this Fixed Rate Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 12. Unclaimed Money If money for the payment of principal, interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors and the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further liability with respect to such monies. 13. Discharge and Defeasance Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate some of or all its obligations under the Fixed Rate Securities and the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of, and interest on the Fixed Rate Securities to redemption, or maturity, as the case may be. 14. Amendment, Waiver Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities or the Fixed Rate Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all of the Fixed Rate Securities then outstanding voting as a single class and (ii) any Default with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all of the Fixed Rate Securities then outstanding voting as a single class. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder of Fixed Rate Securities, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the
7 Trustee may amend the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities or the Fixed Rate Securities (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; (ii) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture in compliance with Article 5 of the Indenture; (iii) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; (iv) to add Guarantees with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any such Guarantee or security when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under the Indenture; (v) to add additional covenants for the benefit of the Holders of the Fixed Rate Securities or to surrender rights and powers conferred on the Company; (vi) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of Fixed Rate Securities in any material respect, subject to the provisions of the Indenture; (vii) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA; (viii) to make any amendment to provisions of the Indenture relating to form, authentication, transfer and legending of the Fixed Rate Securities; provided, however, that compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Fixed Rate Securities being transferred in violation of the Securities Act; or (ix) to provide for the issuance of the Fixed Rate Exchange Securities or Additional Fixed Rate Securities in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. 15. Defaults and Remedies An "Event of Default" with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities occurs if: (i) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Fixed Rate Security when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for 30 days; (ii) the Company defaults in the payment of principal of any Fixed Rate Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption or required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (iii) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 5.01 of the Indenture with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities ; (iv) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with Section 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 or 4.12 of the Indenture (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Securities) with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (v) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with its agreements contained in the Fixed Rate Securities or the Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above) with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (vi) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary under Sections 6.01(7) and (8) of the Indenture; (viii) any final and nonappealable judgment or decree (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) is
8 rendered against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary and such final judgment or decree remains outstanding and is not satisfied, discharged or waived within a period of 60 days following such judgment; or (ix) any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities ceases to be in full force and effect in all material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under the Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice specified below. The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether such Event of Default is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a default under clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) (only with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary) shall not constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities until the Trustee notifies the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Fixed Rate Securities notify the Company and the Trustee of the default and the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, does not cure such default within any applicable time specified in clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default with respect to the Fixed Rate Securities occurs (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all of the outstanding Fixed Rate Securities may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Fixed Rate Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Fixed Rate Securities may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Securities and its consequences. 16. Trustee Dealings with the Company Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Fixed Rate Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 17. No Recourse Against Others A director, officer, employee or shareholder, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company
9 under the Fixed Rate Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Fixed Rate Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Fixed Rate Securities. 18. Authentication This Fixed Rate Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security. 19. Abbreviations Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act). 20. Governing Law THIS FIXED RATE SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. 21.

No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Fixed Rate Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

The Applicable Floating Rate will be reset semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Company shall pay interest semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Interest on the Floating Rate Securities shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from November 21, 2006 until the principal hereof is due. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Floating Rate Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. "Applicable Floating Rate" means, for each semi-annual period during which any Floating Rate Security is outstanding subsequent to the initial semi-annual period, 375 basis points over the rate determined by the Company (notice of such rate to be sent to the Trustee by the Company on the date of determination thereof), equal to the British Bankers' Association LIBOR rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of six months as reported by any generally recognized financial information service as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) two Business Days immediately prior to the first day of such semi-annual period; provided, however, that, if no British Bankers' Association LIBOR rate is available to the Company, the Applicable Floating Rate for the relevant semi-annual period shall instead be at the rate at which Goldman, Sachs & Co. or one of its affiliate banks offers to place deposits in U.S. dollars with first-class banks in the London interbank market for a period of six months at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) two Business Days immediately prior to the first day of such semi-annual period, in amounts equal to $1.0 million. The semi-annual periods referred to in this definition shall commence on June 1 and December 1 of each year; provided, however, that the Applicable Floating Rate for the initial semi-annual period commencing upon original issuance of the Floating Rate Securities shall be [_____]%. The interest rate on the Floating Rate Securities will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by U.S. law of general application. (b) Additional Interest--Registration. The Holder of this Floating Rate Security is entitled to the benefits of a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of November 21, 2006, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and certain purchasers of the Floating Rate Securities named therein (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Capitalized terms used in this paragraph (b) but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Registration Rights Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Registration Default, the Company shall notify the Trustee of such Registration Default and pay additional interest to each Holder of Registrable
4 Securities, during the period of such Registration Default in such amounts and subject to such limitations as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. All accrued additional interest shall be paid to Holders in the same manner as interest payments on the Floating Rate Securities on semi-annual payment dates which correspond to interest payment dates for the Floating Rate Securities. Following the cure of all outstanding Registration Defaults, the accrual of additional interest shall cease. The Trustee shall have no responsibility with respect to the determination of the amount of any such additional interest. (c) Additional Interest--General All references to payments of interest include payments of additional interest, if any. 2. Method of Payment The Company shall pay interest on the Floating Rate Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on the May 15 or November 15 next preceding the interest payment date even if Floating Rate Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company shall pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in money of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Floating Rate Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company or any successor Depository. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest), at the office of the Paying Agent, except that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided, however, that payments on a Floating Rate Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States of America if such Holder has elected payment by wire transfer by providing written wire instructions to the Trustee or the Paying Agent on or after the Closing Date but, in any event, no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion). 3. Paying Agent and Registrar Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. 4. Indenture The Company issued the Floating Rate Securities under an Indenture dated as of November 21, 2006 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Floating Rate Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "TIA"). Terms defined in the Indenture
5 and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Floating Rate Securities are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Holders (as defined in the Indenture) are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of such terms and provisions. The Floating Rate Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. This Floating Rate Security is one of the Initial Floating Rate Securities referred to in the Indenture. The Floating Rate Securities include the Initial Floating Rate Securities and any Floating Rate Exchange Securities issued in exchange for Initial Floating Rate Securities pursuant to the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement. The Initial Floating Rate Securities, any Floating Rate Exchange Securities and all other Floating Rate Securities are treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, among other things, make certain Investments and other Restricted Payments, pay dividends and other distributions, incur Indebtedness, enter into consensual restrictions upon the payment of certain dividends and distributions by such Restricted Subsidiaries, sell assets, including shares of capital stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, enter into or permit certain transactions with Affiliates and create or incur Liens. The Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its property. Following the first day (the "Suspension Date") that (i) the Floating Rate Securities have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default with respect to the Floating Rate Securities has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.11 and Section 5.01(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants") of the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities. In addition, the Company may elect to suspend the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the Floating Rate Securities. Upon and following any Reversion Date, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to the Floating Rate Securities with respect to future events and the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the Floating Rate Securities shall be reinstated. 5. Guarantee The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium and interest on, the Floating Rate Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Indenture. The precise terms of the Guarantee of the Floating Rate Securities and the Guaranteed Obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors with respect to the Floating Rate Securities are expressly set forth in Article 10 of the Indenture. 6. Optional Redemption The Company may redeem the Floating Rate Securities, in whole or in part, at any time on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at 100.000% of principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders
6 of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). 7. Sinking Fund The Floating Rate Securities are not subject to any sinking fund. 8. Notice of Redemption Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Floating Rate Securities to be redeemed at his, her or its registered address. Floating Rate Securities in denominations larger than $2,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $2,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest on all Floating Rate Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Floating Rate Securities (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 9. Repurchase of Securities at the Option of Holders Upon a Change of Control, any Holder of Floating Rate Securities will have the right, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture, to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Floating Rate Securities of such Holder at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. In accordance with Section 4.06 of the Indenture, the Company will be required to offer to purchase Floating Rate Securities upon the occurrence of certain events. 10. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange The Floating Rate Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Floating Rate Securities in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Floating Rate Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Floating Rate Securities for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Floating Rate Securities to be redeemed or for a period of 15 days prior to an interest payment date.
7 11. Persons Deemed Owners Except as provided in paragraph 2 hereof, the registered Holder of this Floating Rate Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 12. Unclaimed Money If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors and the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further liability with respect to such monies. 13. Discharge and Defeasance Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate some of or all its obligations under the Floating Rate Securities and the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of, and interest on the Floating Rate Securities to redemption, or maturity, as the case may be. 14. Amendment, Waiver Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities or the Floating Rate Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all of the Floating Rate Securities then outstanding voting as a single class and (ii) any Default with respect to the Floating Rate Securities may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all of the Floating Rate Securities then outstanding voting as a single class. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder of the Floating Rate Securities, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities or the Floating Rate Securities (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; (ii) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture in compliance with Article 5 of the Indenture; (iii) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; (iv) to add Guarantees with respect to the Floating Rate Securities or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any such Guarantee or security with respect to the Floating Rate Securities when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under the Indenture; (v) to add additional covenants for the benefit of the Floating Rate Securities or to surrender rights and powers conferred on the Company; (vi) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of Floating Rate Securities in any material respect, subject to the provisions of the Indenture; (vii) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA; (viii) to make any amendment to provisions of the Indenture relating to form, authentication, transfer and legending of the Floating Rate Securities; provided, however, that compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Floating Rate
8 Securities being transferred in violation of the Securities Act; or (ix) to provide for the issuance of the Floating Rate Exchange Securities or Additional Floating Rate Securities in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. 15. Defaults and Remedies An "Event of Default" with respect to the Floating Rate Securities occurs if: (i) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Floating Rate Security when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for 30 days; (ii) the Company defaults in the payment of principal of any Floating Rate Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption or required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (iii) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 5.01 of the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities; (iv) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with Section 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 or 4.12 of the Indenture (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Securities) with respect to the Floating Rate Securities and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (v) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with its agreements contained in the Floating Rate Securities or the Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above) with respect to the Floating Rate Securities and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (vi) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary under Sections 6.01(7) and (8) of the Indenture; (viii) any final and nonappealable judgment or decree (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) is rendered against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary and such final judgment or decree remains outstanding and is not satisfied, discharged or waived within a period of 60 days following such judgment; or (ix) any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Floating Rate Securities ceases to be in full force and effect in all material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under the Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Floating Rate Securities and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice specified below. The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether such Event of Default is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a default under clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) (only with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary) shall not constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Floating Rate Securities until the Trustee notifies the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Floating Rate Securities notify the Company and the Trustee of the default and the Company or
9 the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, does not cure such default within any applicable time specified in clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default with respect to the Floating Rate Securities occurs (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all of the outstanding Floating Rate Securities may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Floating Rate Securities to be due and payable. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Floating Rate Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Floating Rate Securities may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Securities and its consequences. 16. Trustee Dealings with the Company Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Floating Rate Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 17. No Recourse Against Others A director, officer, employee or shareholder, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Floating Rate Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Floating Rate Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Floating Rate Securities. 18. Authentication This Floating Rate Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security. 19. Abbreviations Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
10 20. Governing Law THIS FLOATING RATE SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. 21. CUSIP Numbers and ISINs The Company has caused CUSIP numbers and ISINs to be printed on the Floating Rate Securities and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers and ISINs in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Floating Rate Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

[FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF FLOATING RATE EXCHANGE SECURITY] Floating Rate Senior Note due 2009 1. Interest (a) THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY, an Ohio corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Floating Rate Security at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Floating Rate. The Applicable Floating Rate will be reset semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Company shall pay interest semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Interest on the Floating Rate Securities shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from November 21, 2006 until the principal hereof is due. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Floating Rate Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful. "Applicable Floating Rate" means, for each semi-annual period during which any Floating Rate Security is outstanding subsequent to the initial semi-annual period, 375 basis points over the rate determined by the Company (notice of such rate to be sent to the Trustee by the Company on the date of determination thereof), equal to the British Bankers' Association LIBOR rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of six months as reported by any generally recognized financial information service as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) two Business Days immediately prior to the first day of such semi-annual period; provided, however, that, if no British Bankers' Association LIBOR rate is available to the Company, the Applicable Floating Rate for the relevant semi-annual period shall instead be at the rate at which Goldman, Sachs & Co. or one of its affiliate banks offers to place deposits in U.S. dollars with first-class banks in the London interbank market for a period of six months at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) two Business Days immediately prior to the first day of such semi-annual period, in amounts equal to $1.0 million. The semi-annual periods referred to in this definition shall commence on June 1 and December 1 of each year; provided, however, that the Applicable Floating Rate for the initial semi-annual period commencing upon original issuance of the Floating Rate Securities shall be [_____]%. The interest rate on the Floating Rate Securities will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by U.S. law of general application. (b) Additional Interest--General All references to payments of interest include payments of additional interest, if any.
2 2. Method of Payment The Company shall pay interest on the Floating Rate Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on the May 15 or November 15 next preceding the interest payment date even if Floating Rate Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company shall pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in money of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Floating Rate Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company or any successor Depository. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest), at the office of the Paying Agent, except that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided, however, that payments on a Floating Rate Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States of America if such Holder has elected payment by wire transfer by providing written wire instructions to the Trustee or the Paying Agent on or after the Closing Date but, in any event, no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion). 3. Paying Agent and Registrar Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. 4. Indenture The Company issued the Floating Rate Securities under an Indenture dated as of November 21, 2005 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Floating Rate Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "TIA"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Floating Rate Securities are subject to all terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Holders (as defined in the Indenture) are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of such terms and provisions. The Floating Rate Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. This Floating Rate Security is one of the Floating Rate Exchange Securities referred to in the Indenture. The Floating Rate Securities include the Initial Floating Rate Securities and the Floating Rate Exchange Securities issued in exchange for Initial
3 Floating Rate Securities pursuant to the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement. The Initial Floating Rate Securities, the Floating Rate Exchange Securities and all other Floating Rate Securities are treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, among other things, make certain Investments and other Restricted Payments, pay dividends and other distributions, incur Indebtedness, enter into consensual restrictions upon the payment of certain dividends and distributions by such Restricted Subsidiaries, sell assets, including shares of capital stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, enter into or permit certain transactions with Affiliates and create or incur Liens. The Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its property. Following the first day (the "Suspension Date") that (i) the Floating Rate Securities have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default with respect to the Floating Rate Securities has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.11 and Section 5.01(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants") of the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities. In addition, the Company may elect to suspend the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the Floating Rate Securities. Upon and following any Reversion Date, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to the Floating Rate Securities with respect to future events and the Subsidiary Guarantees with respect to the Floating Rate Securities shall be reinstated. 5. Guarantee The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium and interest on, the Floating Rate Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Indenture. The precise terms of the Guarantee of the Floating Rate Securities and the Guaranteed Obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors with respect to the Floating Rate Securities are expressly set forth in Article 10 of the Indenture. 6. Optional Redemption The Company may redeem the Floating Rate Securities, in whole or in part, at any time on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at 100.000% of principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). 7. Sinking Fund The Floating Rate Securities are not subject to any sinking fund.
4 8. Notice of Redemption Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Floating Rate Securities to be redeemed at his, her or its registered address. Floating Rate Securities in denominations larger than $2,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $2,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest on all Floating Rate Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Floating Rate Securities (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 9. Repurchase of Securities at the Option of Holders Upon a Change of Control, any Holder of Floating Rate Securities will have the right, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture, to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Floating Rate Securities of such Holder at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. In accordance with Section 4.06 of the Indenture, the Company will be required to offer to purchase Floating Rate Securities upon the occurrence of certain events. 10. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange The Floating Rate Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and whole multiples of $2,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Floating Rate Securities in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Floating Rate Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Floating Rate Securities for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Floating Rate Securities to be redeemed or for a period of 15 days prior to an interest payment date. 11. Persons Deemed Owners Except as provided in paragraph 2 hereof, the registered Holder of this Floating Rate Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
5 12. Unclaimed Money If money for the payment of principal, interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors and the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further liability with respect to such monies. 13. Discharge and Defeasance Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate some of or all its obligations under the Floating Rate Securities and the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of, and interest on the Floating Rate Securities to redemption, or maturity, as the case may be. 14. Amendment, Waiver Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities or the Floating Rate Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all of the Floating Rate Securities then outstanding voting as a single class and (ii) any Default with respect to the Floating Rate Securities may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all of the Floating Rate Securities then outstanding voting as a single class. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder of the Floating Rate Securities, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities or the Floating Rate Securities (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; (ii) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture in compliance with Article 5 of the Indenture; (iii) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; (iv) to add Guarantees with respect to the Floating Rate Securities or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any such Guarantee or security with respect to the Floating Rate Securities when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under the Indenture; (v) to add additional covenants for the benefit of the Floating Rate Securities or to surrender rights and powers conferred on the Company; (vi) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of Floating Rate Securities in any material respect, subject to the provisions of the Indenture; (vii) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA; (viii) to make any amendment to provisions of the Indenture relating to form, authentication, transfer and legending of the Floating Rate Securities; provided, however, that compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Floating Rate Securities being transferred in violation of the Securities Act; or (ix) to provide for the issuance of the Floating Rate Exchange
6 Securities or Additional Floating Rate Securities in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. 15. Defaults and Remedies An "Event of Default" with respect to the Floating Rate Securities occurs if: (i) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Floating Rate Security when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for 30 days; (ii) the Company defaults in the payment of principal of any Floating Rate Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption or required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (iii) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 5.01 of the Indenture with respect to the Floating Rate Securities; (iv) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with Section 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 or 4.12 of the Indenture (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Securities) with respect to the Floating Rate Securities and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (v) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to comply with its agreements contained in the Floating Rate Securities or the Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above) with respect to the Floating Rate Securities and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice from the Trustee or the Holders specified below; (vi) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary under Sections 6.01(7) and (8) of the Indenture; (viii) any final and nonappealable judgment or decree (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not so covered) is rendered against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary and such final judgment or decree remains outstanding and is not satisfied, discharged or waived within a period of 60 days following such judgment; or (ix) any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Floating Rate Securities ceases to be in full force and effect in all material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under the Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Floating Rate Securities and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice specified below. The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether such Event of Default is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a default under clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) (only with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary) shall not constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Floating Rate Securities until
7 the Trustee notifies the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Floating Rate Securities notify the Company and the Trustee of the default and the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, does not cure such default within any applicable time specified in clause (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) or (ix) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default with respect to the Floating Rate Securities occurs (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all of the outstanding Floating Rate Securities may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Floating Rate Securities to be due and payable. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Floating Rate Securities shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Floating Rate Securities may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Securities and its consequences. 16. Trustee Dealings with the Company Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Floating Rate Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 17. No Recourse Against Others A director, officer, employee or shareholder, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Floating Rate Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Floating Rate Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Floating Rate Securities. 18. Authentication This Floating Rate Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security. 19. Abbreviations Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).

Governing Law THIS FLOATING RATE SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. 21. CUSIP Numbers and ISINs The Company has caused CUSIP numbers and ISINs to be printed on the Floating Rate Securities and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers and ISINs in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Floating Rate Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

Registration Under the Securities Act. (a) Except as set forth in Section 2(b) below, the Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to file under the Securities Act a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange (such registration statement, the "Exchange Registration Statement", and such offer, the "Exchange Offer") any and all of the Securities for a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities issued by the Company and guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors, which debt securities and guarantees are substantially identical to the Securities and the related Guarantees, respectively (and are entitled to the benefits of a trust indenture which is substantially identical to the Indenture or is the Indenture and which has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act), except that they have been registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and do not contain provisions for the additional interest contemplated in Section 2(c) below (such new debt securities hereinafter called "Exchange Securities"). The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act. The Exchange Offer will be registered under the Securities Act on the appropriate form and will comply in all material respects with all applicable tender offer rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. The Company further agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Exchange Offer no later than 60 days after its commencement, hold the Exchange Offer open for at least 20 business days and exchange Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn on or prior to the expiration of the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer will be deemed to have been "completed" only if the debt securities and related guarantees received by holders other than Restricted Holders in the Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities are, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and without material restrictions under the blue sky or securities laws of a substantial majority of the States of the United States of America. The Exchange Offer shall be deemed to have been completed upon the Company having exchanged, pursuant to the Exchange Offer, Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the Exchange Offer, which shall be on a date that is at least 20 business days following the commencement of the Exchange Offer. If any broker-dealer receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities, and any such broker-dealer so requests, the Company agrees (x) to include in the Exchange Registration Statement a prospectus for use in any resales by any holder of Exchange Securities that is such a broker-dealer and (y) to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Exchange Registration Statement effective for a period (the "Resale Period") beginning when Exchange Securities are first issued in the Exchange Offer and ending upon the earlier of the expiration of the 180th day after the Exchange Offer has been completed or such time as such broker-dealers notify the Company that they no longer own any Registrable Securities. With respect to such Exchange Registration Statement, such holders shall have the benefit of the rights of indemnification and contribution set forth in Sections 6(a), (c), (d) and (e) hereof. (b) If (i) on or prior to the time the Exchange Offer is completed existing Commission interpretations are changed such that the debt securities or the related guarantees received by holders other than Restricted Holders in the Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities 4
are not or would not be, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the Securities Act, (ii) the Exchange Offer has not been completed within 270 days following the Closing Date or (iii) any holder of the Securities notifies the Company prior to the 20th business day following the consummation of the Exchange Offer that the Exchange Offer is not available to such holder, the Company shall, in lieu of (or, in the case of clause (iii), in addition to) conducting the Exchange Offer contemplated by Section 2(a), use commercially reasonable efforts to file under the Securities Act a "shelf" registration statement providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders of, all of the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission (such filing, the "Shelf Registration" and such registration statement, the "Shelf Registration Statement"). The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (x) to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective and to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective for a period ending on the earlier of the second anniversary of the Closing Date or such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding, provided, however, that no holder shall be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities unless such holder is an Electing Holder, and (y) after the Effective Time of the Shelf Registration Statement, promptly upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities that is not then an Electing Holder, to take any action reasonably necessary to enable such holder to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, any action necessary to identify such holder as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement, provided, however, that nothing in this Clause (y) shall relieve any such holder of the obligation to return a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company in accordance with Section 3(d)(iii) hereof, provided further, that each holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish such additional information as may be required from time to time to be disclosed in order to make the information previously provided to the Company not misleading. The Company further agrees to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement, as and when required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration, and the Company agrees to furnish to each Electing Holder copies of any such supplement or amendment prior to its being used or promptly following its filing with the Commission. (c) In the event that (i) the Exchange Offer is not completed (or, if required pursuant to Section 2(b), the Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective) on or before the date that is 270 days after the Closing Date, or (ii) any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement required by Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof is filed and declared effective but shall fail to be usable for its intended purpose, shall be suspended by the Company or shall become subject to an effective stop order issued pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement (except as specifically permitted herein), in each case for a period in excess of 45 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, (each such event referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), a "Registration Default" and each period during which a Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, a "Registration Default Period") then, as liquidated damages for such Registration Default, special interest ("Special 5

(b) Any documents incorporated by reference in any prospectus referred to in Section 5(a) hereof, when they become or became effective or are or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform or conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of such documents will contain or contained an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use therein. (c) The compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is subject, nor 16

(d) This Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. 6. Indemnification. (a) Indemnification by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each of the holders of Registrable Securities included in an Exchange Registration Statement, each of the Electing Holders of Registrable Securities included in a Shelf Registration Statement and each person who participates as a placement or sales agent or as an underwriter in any offering or sale of such Registrable Securities against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such holder, agent or underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such holder, Electing Holder, agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such holder, such Electing Holder, such agent and such underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be liable to any such person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, or preliminary, final or summary prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such person expressly for use therein. (b) Indemnification by the Holders and any Agents and Underwriters. The Company may require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof and to entering into any underwriting agreement with respect thereto, that the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from the Electing Holder of such Registrable Securities and from each underwriter named in any such underwriting agreement, severally and not jointly, to (i) 17
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, and all other holders of Registrable Securities, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or such other holders of Registrable Securities may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such Electing Holder, agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Electing Holder or underwriter expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company and any of the Subsidiary Guarantors for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that no such Electing Holder shall be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Electing Holder from the sale of such Electing Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration. (c) Notices of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the 18
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders' and any underwriters' obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, agent and underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and any agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder, agent or underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company or the Guarantor) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. 7. Underwritten Offerings. (a) Selection of Underwriters. If any of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration are to be sold pursuant to an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or 19
underwriters thereof shall be designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering, provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are reasonably acceptable to the Company. (b) Participation by Holders. Each holder of Registrable Securities hereby agrees with each other such holder that no such holder may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees to sell such holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 8. Rule 144. The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that it shall comply with the reporting and information covenant in the Indenture. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with that holder's sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 9. Miscellaneous. (a) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that it has not granted, and shall not grant, registration rights with respect to Registrable Securities or any other securities which would be inconsistent with the terms contained in this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement. (b) Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge that there would be no adequate remedy at law if the Company fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder and that the Purchaser and the holders from time to time of the Registrable Securities may be irreparably harmed by any such failure, and accordingly agree that the Purchaser and such holders, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, shall be entitled to compel specific performance of the obligations of the Company under this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, in any court of the United States or any State thereof having jurisdiction. (c) Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered by hand, if delivered personally or by courier, or three days after being deposited in the mail (registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested), except that notices of changes of address shall be effective only upon receipt, as follows: If to the Company, to it at Attn: Secretary, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, 1444 East Market Street, Akron, Ohio 44316, and if to a holder, to the address of such holder set forth in the security register or other records of the Company, or to such other address as the Company or any such holder may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, provided that while the Securities are in book-entry form, notice to the Trustee shall serve as notice to the holders. (d) Parties in Interest. All the terms and provisions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and the holders from time to time of the Registrable 20
Securities and the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto and such holders. In the event that any transferee of any holder of Registrable Securities shall acquire Registrable Securities, in any manner, whether by gift, bequest, purchase, operation of law or otherwise, such transferee shall, without any further writing or action of any kind, be deemed a beneficiary hereof for all purposes and such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such transferee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of, and be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by all of the applicable terms and provisions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement. If the Company shall so request, any such successor, assign or transferee shall agree in writing to acquire and hold the Registrable Securities subject to all of the applicable terms hereof. (e) Survival. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and each other provision set forth in this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement or made pursuant hereto shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation (or statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any holder of Registrable Securities, any director, officer or partner of such holder, any agent or underwriter or any director, officer or partner thereof, or any controlling person of any of the foregoing, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the transfer and registration of Registrable Securities by such holder and the consummation of an Exchange Offer. (f) Governing Law. This Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. (g) Headings. The descriptive headings of the several Sections and paragraphs of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement are inserted for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement.

Each holder of any Registrable Securities at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any amendment or waiver effected pursuant to this Section 9(h), whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment or waiver appears on such Registrable Securities or is delivered to such holder. (i) Inspection. For so long as this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement shall be in effect, this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement and a complete list of the names and addresses of all the holders of Registrable Securities shall be made available for inspection and copying on any business day by any holder of Registrable Securities for proper purposes only (which shall include any purpose related to the rights of the holders of Registrable Securities under the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement) at the offices of the Company at the address thereof set forth in Section 9(c) above and at the office of the Trustee under the Indenture. 21

Registration Under the Securities Act. (a) Except as set forth in Section 2(b) below, the Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to file under the Securities Act a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange (such registration statement, the "Exchange Registration Statement", and such offer, the "Exchange Offer") any and all of the Securities for a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities issued by the Company and guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors, which debt securities and guarantees are substantially identical to the Securities and the related Guarantees, respectively (and are entitled to the benefits of a trust indenture which is substantially identical to the Indenture or is the Indenture and which has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act), except that they have been registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and do not contain provisions for the additional interest contemplated in Section 2(c) below (such new debt securities hereinafter called "Exchange Securities"). The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act. The Exchange Offer will be registered under the Securities Act on the appropriate form and will comply in all material respects with all applicable tender offer rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. The Company further agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Exchange Offer no later than 60 days after its commencement, hold the Exchange Offer open for at least 20 business days and exchange Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn on or prior to the expiration of the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer will be deemed to have been "completed" only if the debt securities and related guarantees received by holders other than Restricted Holders in the Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities are, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and without material restrictions under the blue sky or securities laws of a substantial majority of the States of the United States of America. The Exchange Offer shall be deemed to have been completed upon the Company having exchanged, pursuant to the Exchange Offer, Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the Exchange Offer, which shall be on a date that is at least 20 business days following the commencement of the Exchange Offer. If any broker-dealer receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities, and any such broker-dealer so requests, the Company agrees (x) to include in the Exchange Registration Statement a prospectus for use in any resales by any holder of Exchange Securities that is such a broker-dealer and (y) to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Exchange Registration Statement effective for a period (the "Resale Period") beginning when Exchange Securities are first issued in the Exchange Offer and ending upon the earlier of the expiration of the 180th day after the Exchange Offer has been completed or such time as such broker-dealers notify the Company that they no longer own any Registrable Securities. With respect to such Exchange Registration Statement, such holders shall have the benefit of the rights of indemnification and contribution set forth in Sections 6(a), (c), (d) and (e) hereof. (b) If (i) on or prior to the time the Exchange Offer is completed existing Commission interpretations are changed such that the debt securities or the related guarantees received by holders other than Restricted Holders in the Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities 4
are not or would not be, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the Securities Act, (ii) the Exchange Offer has not been completed within 270 days following the Closing Date or (iii) any holder of the Securities notifies the Company prior to the 20th business day following the consummation of the Exchange Offer that the Exchange Offer is not available to such holder, the Company shall, in lieu of (or, in the case of clause (iii), in addition to) conducting the Exchange Offer contemplated by Section 2(a), use commercially reasonable efforts to file under the Securities Act a "shelf" registration statement providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders of, all of the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission (such filing, the "Shelf Registration" and such registration statement, the "Shelf Registration Statement"). The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (x) to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective and to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective for a period ending on the earlier of the second anniversary of the Closing Date or such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding, provided, however, that no holder shall be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities unless such holder is an Electing Holder, and (y) after the Effective Time of the Shelf Registration Statement, promptly upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities that is not then an Electing Holder, to take any action reasonably necessary to enable such holder to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, any action necessary to identify such holder as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement, provided, however, that nothing in this Clause (y) shall relieve any such holder of the obligation to return a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company in accordance with Section 3(d)(iii) hereof, provided further, that each holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish such additional information as may be required from time to time to be disclosed in order to make the information previously provided to the Company not misleading. The Company further agrees to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement, as and when required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration, and the Company agrees to furnish to each Electing Holder copies of any such supplement or amendment prior to its being used or promptly following its filing with the Commission. (c) In the event that (i) the Exchange Offer is not completed (or, if required pursuant to Section 2(b), the Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective) on or before the date that is 270 days after the Closing Date, or (ii) any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement required by Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof is filed and declared effective but shall fail to be usable for its intended purpose, shall be suspended by the Company or shall become subject to an effective stop order issued pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement (except as specifically permitted herein), in each case for a period in excess of 45 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, (each such event referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), a "Registration Default" and each period during which a Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, a "Registration Default Period") then, as liquidated damages for such Registration Default, special interest ("Special 5
Interest"), in addition to the Base Interest, shall accrue at a per annum rate of 0.25% for the first 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum rate of 0.50% for the second 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum rate of 0.75% for the third 90 days of the Registration Default Period and at a per annum rate of 1.00% thereafter for the remaining portion of the Registration Default Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (a) in the case of clause (i) above, upon the completion of the Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration Statement being declared effective, as applicable, or (b) in the case of clause (ii) above, upon the occurrence of any event (including the filing of an appropriate amendment to the relevant Registration Statement, another Registration Statement being declared effective, or the taking of other appropriate action) that causes the Exchange Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, to again be declared effective or made usable, the Special Interest payable as a result of clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, shall cease to accrue. The Special Interest provided for in this Section 2(c) shall be the exclusive monetary remedy available to holders of Securities for Registration Defaults. (d) The Company shall take, and shall cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to take, all actions necessary to be taken by it to ensure that the transactions contemplated herein are effected as so contemplated, including all actions necessary or desirable to register the Guarantees under the registration statement contemplated in Section 2(a) or 2(b) hereof, as applicable. (e) Any reference herein to a registration statement as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time and any reference herein to any post-effective amendment to a registration statement as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time. (f) Subject to the Company's obligation to pay Special Interest in accordance with Section 2(c) above, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to suspend any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement by notice to each broker-dealer or holder of Registrable Securities, as applicable. 3. Registration Procedures. If the Company files a registration statement pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b), the following provisions shall apply: (a) At or before the Effective Time of the Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration, as the case may be, the Company shall qualify the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. (b) In the event that such qualification would require the appointment of a new trustee under the Indenture, the Company shall appoint a new trustee thereunder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture. (c) In connection with the Company's obligations with respect to the registration of Exchange Securities as contemplated by Section 2(a) (the "Exchange Registration"), if applicable, the Company shall: (i) prepare and file with the Commission an Exchange Registration Statement on any form which may be utilized by the Company and which shall permit the Exchange Offer and resales of Exchange Securities by broker-dealers during the Resale Period to be effected as contemplated by Section 2(a), and use commercially 6

other actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable each such Electing Holder, agent, if any, and underwriter, if any, to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of such Registrable Securities; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be required for any such purpose to (1) qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for the requirements of this Section 3(d)(xii), (2) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction or become subject to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (3) make any changes to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or any agreement between it and its stockholders; (xiii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent or approval of each governmental agency or authority, whether federal, state or local, which may be required to effect the Shelf Registration or the offering or sale in connection therewith or to enable the selling holder or holders to offer, or to consummate the disposition of, their Registrable Securities, subject to the proviso in clause (xii) above; (xiv) unless any Registrable Securities shall be in book-entry only form, cooperate with the Electing Holders and the managing underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold, which certificates, if so required by any securities exchange upon which any Registrable Securities are listed, shall be penned, lithographed or engraved, or produced by any combination of such methods, on steel engraved borders, and which certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends; and, in the case of an underwritten offering, enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriters may request at least two business days prior to any sale of the Registrable Securities; (xv) provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities, not later than the applicable Effective Time; (xvi) enter into one or more underwriting agreements, engagement letters, agency agreements, "best efforts" underwriting agreements or similar agreements, as appropriate, including customary provisions relating to indemnification and contribution, and take such other actions in connection therewith as any Electing Holders aggregating at least 20% in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities at the time outstanding shall request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities; (xvii) whether or not an agreement of the type referred to in Section 3(d)(xvi) hereof is entered into and whether or not any portion of the offering contemplated by the Shelf Registration is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales agent or any other entity, (A) make such representations and warranties to the Electing Holders and the placement or sales agent, if any, therefor and the underwriters, if any, thereof in form, substance and scope as are customarily made in connection with an offering of debt securities pursuant to any appropriate agreement or to a registration statement filed on the form applicable to the Shelf Registration; (B) obtain an opinion of counsel to the Company in customary form and covering such matters, of the type customarily covered by such an opinion, as the managing underwriters, if any, or as any Electing Holders of at least 20% in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities at the time outstanding may reasonably request, addressed to such Electing Holder or Electing Holders and the placement or sales agent, if any, therefor and the underwriters, if any, thereof and dated the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement (and if such Shelf Registration 12

("NASD") or any successor thereto, as amended from time to time) thereof, whether as a holder of such Registrable Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, assist such broker-dealer in complying with the requirements of such Conduct Rules, including by (A) if such Conduct Rules shall so require, engaging a "qualified independent underwriter" (as defined in such Conduct Rules) to participate in the preparation of the Shelf Registration Statement relating to such Registrable Securities, to exercise usual standards of due diligence in respect thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by such Shelf Registration Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales agent, to recommend the yield of such Registrable Securities, (B) indemnifying any such qualified independent underwriter to the extent of the indemnification of underwriters provided in Section 6 hereof (or to such other customary extent as may be requested by such 13

(e) In the event that the Company would be required, pursuant to Section 3(d)(viii)(F) above, to notify the Electing Holders, the placement or sales agent, if any, therefor and the managing underwriters, if any, thereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and furnish to each of the Electing Holders, to each placement or sales agent, if any, and to each such underwriter, if any, a reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall conform in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing. If so directed by the Company, each Electing Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Electing Holder's possession of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. (f) Each broker-dealer and Electing Holder agrees that upon receipt of any notice from the Company pursuant to Section 3(c)(iii)(F) or (G), or Section 3(d)(viii)(F) or (G), such broker-dealer or Electing Holder, as applicable, shall forthwith discontinue the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, until (A) in the case of Section 3(c)(iii)(F) or Section 3(d)(viii)(F), such broker-dealer or Electing Holder, as applicable, shall have received copies of an amended or supplemented prospectus in accordance with Section 3(c)(iv) or Section 3(e), as applicable, or (B) in the case of Section 3(c)(iii)(G) or Section 3(d)(viii)(G), such broker-dealer or Electing Holder, as applicable, shall have received notice that the Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, is no longer suspended pursuant to Section 2(f). (g) In the event of a Shelf Registration, in addition to the information required to be provided by each Electing Holder in its Notice Questionnaire, the Company may require such Electing Holder to furnish to the Company such additional information regarding such Electing Holder and such Electing Holder's intended method of distribution of Registrable Securities as may be required in order to comply with the Securities Act. Each such Electing Holder agrees to notify the Company as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished by such Electing Holder to the Company or of the occurrence of any event in either case as a result of which any prospectus relating to such Shelf Registration contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact regarding such Electing Holder or such Electing Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities or omits to state any material fact regarding such Electing Holder or such Electing Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in 14
light of the circumstances then existing, and promptly to furnish to the Company any additional information required to correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that such prospectus shall not contain, with respect to such Electing Holder or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing. (h) Until the expiration of two years after the Closing Date, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its "affiliates" (as defined in Rule 144) to, resell any of the Securities that have been reacquired by any of them except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. 4.

To the extent that any Registration Expenses are incurred, assumed or paid by any holder of Registrable Securities or any placement or sales agent therefor or underwriter thereof, the Company shall reimburse such person for the full amount of the Registration Expenses so incurred, assumed or paid promptly after receipt of a request therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of the Registrable Securities being registered shall pay all agency fees and commissions and underwriting discounts and commissions attributable 15
to the sale of such Registrable Securities and the fees and disbursements of any counsel or other advisors or experts retained by such holders (severally or jointly), other than the counsel and experts specifically referred to above. 5. Representations and Warranties. The Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to, and agree with, each Purchaser and each of the holders from time to time of Registrable Securities that: (a) Each registration statement covering Registrable Securities and each prospectus (including any preliminary or summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(d) or Section 3(c) hereof and any further amendments or supplements to any such registration statement or prospectus, when it becomes effective or is filed with the Commission, as the case may be, and, in the case of an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities, at the time of the closing under the underwriting agreement relating thereto, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and at all times subsequent to the Effective Time when a prospectus would be required to be delivered under the Securities Act, other than from (i) such time as a notice has been given to holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3(d)(viii)(F) or Section 3(c)(iii)(F) hereof until (ii) such time as the Company furnishes an amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to Section 3(e) or Section 3(c)(iv) hereof, each such registration statement, and each prospectus (including any summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(d) or Section 3(c) hereof, as then amended or supplemented, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use therein. (b) Any documents incorporated by reference in any prospectus referred to in Section 5(a) hereof, when they become or became effective or are or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform or conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of such documents will contain or contained an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use therein. (c) The compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is subject, nor 16
will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, as amended, or the by-laws of the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any of their properties except for any such conflict, breach or violation that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement); and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation by the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors of the transactions contemplated by this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, except the registration under the Securities Act of the Securities, qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under State securities or blue sky laws in connection with the offering and distribution of the Securities. (d) This Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. 6. Indemnification. (a) Indemnification by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each of the holders of Registrable Securities included in an Exchange Registration Statement, each of the Electing Holders of Registrable Securities included in a Shelf Registration Statement and each person who participates as a placement or sales agent or as an underwriter in any offering or sale of such Registrable Securities against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such holder, agent or underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such holder, Electing Holder, agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such holder, such Electing Holder, such agent and such underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be liable to any such person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, or preliminary, final or summary prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such person expressly for use therein. (b) Indemnification by the Holders and any Agents and Underwriters. The Company may require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof and to entering into any underwriting agreement with respect thereto, that the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from the Electing Holder of such Registrable Securities and from each underwriter named in any such underwriting agreement, severally and not jointly, to (i) 17
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, and all other holders of Registrable Securities, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or such other holders of Registrable Securities may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such Electing Holder, agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Electing Holder or underwriter expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company and any of the Subsidiary Guarantors for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that no such Electing Holder shall be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Electing Holder from the sale of such Electing Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration. (c) Notices of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the 18
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders' and any underwriters' obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, agent and underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and any agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder, agent or underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company or the Guarantor) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. 7. Underwritten Offerings. (a) Selection of Underwriters. If any of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration are to be sold pursuant to an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or 19
underwriters thereof shall be designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering, provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are reasonably acceptable to the Company. (b) Participation by Holders. Each holder of Registrable Securities hereby agrees with each other such holder that no such holder may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees to sell such holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 8. Rule 144. The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that it shall comply with the reporting and information covenant in the Indenture. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with that holder's sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 9. Miscellaneous. (a) No Inconsistent Agreements.
