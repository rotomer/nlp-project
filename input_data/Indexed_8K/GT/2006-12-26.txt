AKRON, Ohio, December 22, 2006  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company said today that its tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union supports Goodyear's strategy to significantly reduce costs and improve competitiveness in its North American operations.
"Our goal was always to reach a fair agreement that improves our ability to compete and win with customers. This agreement would accomplish that goal," said Robert J. Keegan, chairman and chief executive officer.
The tentative agreement, which covers workers at 12 tire and engineered products plants in the United States, gives Goodyear the ability to reduce excess high-cost manufacturing capacity, reduce legacy costs, improve productivity and reduce labor costs consistent with the four point cost reduction plan that was announced to investors in 2005. The tentative agreement:
Goodyear will hold a conference call in January for investors, financial analysts and media to discuss specifics of the new contract if the tentative agreement is ratified by the USW membership. The timing of that call will be announced at a later date.
The 12 master contract plants and their workers covered by the tentative agreement are: Akron, Ohio; Buffalo, N.Y.; Danville, Va.; Fayetteville, N.C.; Gadsden, Ala.; Lincoln, Neb.; Marysville, Ohio; St. Marys, Ohio; Sun Prairie, Wis.; Topeka, Kan.; Tyler, Texas; and Union City, Tenn.
