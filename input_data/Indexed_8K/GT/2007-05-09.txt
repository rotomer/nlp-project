     As set forth below, we are revising and updating our description of capital stock that will be available for incorporation by reference into our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
     
Description of Capital Stock
     The following summary contains a description of the material terms of our capital stock. The description is based on our articles of incorporation, as amended ("Articles of Incorporation"), our code of regulations, as amended ("Code of Regulations"), and applicable provisions of Ohio law. This summary is not complete. The Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations are incorporated herein by reference and attached as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively.
Voting Rights
     Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter (other than the election of directors) voted upon by shareholders, subject to the rights of the holders of shares of preferred stock, if any, that may be outstanding.
     Except as may otherwise be required by our Articles of Incorporation, our Code of Regulations or Ohio law in respect of certain matters, the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record date is required for any proposal to be adopted. Various matters, including the approval of certain transactions and certain amendments to the Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations, require the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of common stock outstanding.
     In voting for the election of directors, each share is entitled to one vote for each director to be elected. In the election of directors, the candidates for directorships to be filled receiving the most votes will be elected. Any holder of shares of common stock may request that voting for the election of directors be cumulative. In voting cumulatively, a shareholder may give any one candidate for director a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of shares he or she is entitled to vote, or may distribute his or her votes on the same principle among two or more candidates as desired.
     If any shares of a series of preferred stock are outstanding and if six quarterly dividends thereon have not been paid as provided by the terms of that outstanding series of preferred stock, then the holders of the preferred stock have the right to elect, as a class, two members of our board of directors, which rights continue until the dividend payment default is cured. In addition, the separate affirmative vote or consent of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock may be required to authorize certain corporate actions, including mergers and certain amendments to our Articles of Incorporation.
Dividend Rights
     The holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends and other distributions if, as and when declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. These rights are subject to any preferential rights and any sinking fund, redemption or repurchase rights of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. We are not permitted to pay dividends to holders of our common stock if we have not paid or provided for the dividends, if any, fixed with respect to any outstanding shares of preferred stock. The terms of our principal credit agreements and other indebtedness limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock.
 
Liability for Calls and Assessments
     The outstanding shares of our common stock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
Preemptive Rights
     Holders of shares of our common stock do not have preemptive rights or conversion rights as to additional issuances of shares of our common stock or of securities convertible into, or entitling the holder to purchase, shares of our common stock.
Liquidation Rights
     If the Company were voluntarily or involuntarily liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock would be entitled to share in the distribution of all assets remaining after payment of all of our liabilities and after satisfaction of prior distribution rights and payment of any distributions owing to holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock.
Other Information
     Holders of shares of our common stock have no conversion, redemption or call rights related to their shares. We may, pursuant to action authorized by our board of directors, offer to repurchase or otherwise reacquire shares of our common stock, but we may not redeem issued and outstanding shares.
Policy Regarding Shareholder Rights Plans
     We do not have a shareholder rights plan. The board of directors has agreed to the following policy, which is set forth in our corporate governance guidelines, with respect to the future adoption of a rights plan:
Certain Provisions of Ohio Law and the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations
     There are statutory provisions of Ohio law and provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management of the Company, including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the then current market prices for their shares.
   Articles and Code of Regulations
     Our Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations contain various provisions that may have the effect, either alone or in combination with each other, of making more difficult or discouraging a business combination or an attempt to obtain control of the Company that is not approved by the board of directors. These provisions include:
 
   Ohio Law Provisions
     Various laws may affect the legal or practical ability of shareholders to dispose of shares of the Company. Such laws include the Ohio statutory provisions described below.
     Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code prohibits an interested shareholder (defined as a beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent (10%) or more of the voting power of any issuing public Ohio corporation) or any affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder (as defined in Section 1704.01 of the Ohio Revised Code) from engaging in certain transactions with the corporation during the three-year period after the interested shareholder's share acquisition date.
     The prohibited transactions include mergers, consolidations, majority share acquisitions, certain asset sales, loans, certain sales of shares, dissolution, and certain reclassifications, recapitalizations, or other transactions that would increase the proportion of shares held by the interested shareholder.
     After expiration of the three-year period, the corporation may participate in such a transaction with an interested shareholder only if, among other things:
     The prohibitions do not apply if, before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors of the corporation approves either the interested shareholder's acquisition of shares or the otherwise prohibited transaction. The restrictions also do not apply if a person inadvertently becomes an interested shareholder or was an interested shareholder prior to the adoption of the statute on April 11, 1990, unless, subject to certain exceptions, the interested shareholder increases his, her or its proportionate share interest on or after April 11, 1990.
     Pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 1707.043, a public corporation formed in Ohio may recover profits that a shareholder makes from the sale of the corporation's securities within eighteen (18) months after making a proposal to acquire control or publicly disclosing the possibility of a proposal to acquire control. The corporation may not, however, recover from a person who proves in a court of competent jurisdiction either of the following:
 
     Also, before the corporation may obtain any recovery, the aggregate amount of the profit realized by such person must exceed $250,000. Any shareholder may bring an action on behalf of the corporation if a corporation fails or refuses to bring an action to recover these profits within sixty (60) days of a written request. The party bringing such an action may recover attorneys' fees if the court having jurisdiction over such action orders recovery of any profits.
     
Control Share Acquisition Act
     We are also subject to Ohio's Control Share Acquisition Act (Ohio Revised Code 1701.831). The Control Share Acquisition Act provides that, with certain exceptions, a person may acquire beneficial ownership of shares in certain ranges (one-fifth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more) of the voting power of the outstanding shares of an Ohio corporation meeting certain criteria, which the Company meets, only if such person has submitted an "acquiring person statement" and the proposed acquisition has been approved by both (i) the vote of a majority of the voting power of the Company and (ii) by a majority of the voting power of the Company excluding "interested shares," as defined in Section 1701.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
     On May 2, 2007, the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, announced that it had executed search and arrest warrants against a number of companies and their executives in connection with an investigation into allegations of price fixing in the marine hose industry. Goodyear received a grand jury document subpoena on May 2, 2007 relating to that investigation. Neither Goodyear nor any of its executives has been named in any criminal complaint and no search warrant has been executed at any Goodyear facility in connection with the investigation. Goodyear does not believe that it is a target in this investigation and is cooperating with the Department of Justice Antitrust Division.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(i) The conditions or restrictions, if any, upon the issue of any additional shares of the same series or of any other class or series. The Board of Directors is authorized to adopt from time to time amendments to the Amended Articles of Incorporation fixing, with respect to each series, the matters described in clauses (a) to (i), inclusive, of this Section 1. Section 1-A. Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock, Without Par Value. A series of Preferred Stock is hereby created having the following terms: 1. Designation. The shares of such series are designated as: "Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock, without par value." 2
2. Authorized Number of Shares - Fractional Shares. The authorized number of shares constituting the Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock is 3,000,000. Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a shares which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock. 3. Dividends and Distributions. (A) Subject to any prior to superior rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock with respect to dividends that may be authorized by the Amended Articles of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock shall be entitled prior to the payment of any dividends on shares ranking junior to the Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of January, April, July and October in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $10.00 or (b) subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after July 28, 1986 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Payment Date, a dividend of $10.00 per share on the Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. 3
(D) Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. (E) Dividends in full shall not be declared or paid or set apart for payment on the Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock for a dividend period termination on a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date unless dividends in full have been declared or paid or set apart for payment on the Preferred Stock of all series (other than series with respect to which dividends are not cumulative from a date prior to such dividend date) for the respective dividend periods terminating on such dividend date. When the dividends are not paid in full on all series of the Preferred Stock, the shares of all series shall share ratably in the payment of dividends, including accumulations, if any, in accordance with the sums which would be payable on said shares if all dividends were declared and paid in full. 4. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. (A) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock shall have received $10.00 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "Series A Liquidation Preference"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 100 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively. (B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock. (C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock there were 4
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 5. Conversion on Merger, Consolidation, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any merger, consolidation, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 6. Redemption. The outstanding shares of Series A $10.0 Referred Stock shall not be redeemable. 7. Condition to Issuance of any other Series. The Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be further amended to provide for the issuance of any other series of Preferred Stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A $10.00 Preferred Stock, voting separately as one voting group. Section 2. Dividends. (a) The holders of Preferred Stock of each series, in preference of the holders of shares of Common Stock and of any other class of shares ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to receive out of any funds legally available and when and as declared by the Board of Directors dividends in cash at the rate for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Part B and no more, payable on the dividend payment dates fixed for such series. Such dividends shall be cumulative, in the case of shares of each particular series, from and after the date or dates fixed with respect to such series. No dividend may be paid upon or declared or set apart for any series of the Preferred Stock at any time unless at the same time a like proportionate dividend for the dividend periods terminating on the same date or any earlier date, ratably in proportion to the respective annual dividend rates, shall have been paid upon or declared or funds therefor set apart for all shares of Preferred Stock of all series then issued and outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend. (b) So long as any Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, no dividend, except a dividend payable in Common Stock or other shares ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, shall be paid or declared or any distribution be made except as aforesaid on the Common Stock or any other shares ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, nor shall any shares of Common Stock or any other shares ranking junior to the Preferred Stock be purchased, retired or otherwise acquired by the Corporation (except out of the proceeds of the sale of Common Stock or other shares ranking junior to the Preferred Stock received by the Corporation on or subsequent to the date on which shares of Preferred Stock are first issued), unless (i) all accrued and unpaid dividends upon all Preferred Stock then outstanding payable on all dividend payment dates occurring on or prior to the date of such 5
action shall have been declared and paid or funds sufficient therefor, set apart, and (ii) at the date of such action there shall be no arrearages with respect to the redemption of Preferred Stock of any series from any sinking fund provided for shares of such series in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Part B. Section 3. Redemption (a) Subject to the express terms of each series, the Corporation may from time to time redeem all or any part of the Preferred Stock of any series at the time outstanding (i) at the option of the Board of Directors at the applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Part B or (ii) in fulfillment of the requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the applicable sinking fund redemption price fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of this Part B, together in each case with (1) all then unpaid dividends upon such shares payable on all dividend payment dates for such series occurring on or prior to the redemption date, plus (2) if the redemption date is not a dividend payment date for such series, a proportionate dividend, based on the number of elapsed days, for such series, for the period from the day following the most recent such dividend payment date through the redemption date. (b) Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the holders of record of the Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption. At any time after notice has been given as above provided and before the date of redemption specified in such notice the Corporation may deposit the aggregate redemption price of the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed, together with an amount equal to the aggregate amount of dividends payable upon such redemption, with any bank or trust company in New York, New York, having capital and surplus of more than $100,000,000, named in such notice, and direct that such deposited amount be paid to the respective holders of the shares of Preferred Stock so to be redeemed upon surrender of the stock certificate or certificates held by such holders. After the mailing of such notice and the making of such deposit of money, such holders shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation with respect to such shares, except only the right to receive such money from such bank or trust company without interest or to exercise, before the redemption date, any unexpired privileges of conversion. (c) In the event less than all of the outstanding shares of any series of Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall select pro rata or by lot the shares so to be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors. (d) If the holders of shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been called for redemption shall not, without six years after such deposit, claim the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders. (e) Any shares of Preferred Stock (i) redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3, (ii) purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund requirements provided for shares of any series of Preferred Stock, (iii) converted in accordance with the express terms of any such series, or (iv) otherwise acquired by the Corporation, shall resume the status of authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock without serial designation. Section 4. Liquidation. (a) The holders of Preferred Stock of any series shall,in cash of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, be 6
entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or distributed among the holders of shares of Common Stock or any other shares ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, the amounts fixed with respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section 1 of this Part B, plus an amount equal to (i) all then unpaid dividends upon such shares payable on all dividend payment dates for such series occurring on or prior to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, plus (ii) if such date is not a dividend payment date for such series, a proportionate dividend, based on the number of elapsed days, for the period from the day following the most recent such dividend payment date through such date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In case the net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient to permit the payment upon all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock of the full preferential amount to which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be distributed ratably upon outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount to which each such share is entitled. After payment to holders of Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts as aforesaid, holders of Preferred Stock as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. (b) The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the property or business of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section 4. Section 5. Voting. (a) The holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote upon matters presented to the shareholders, except as provided in this Section 5 or as required by law. (b) Whenever, and so long as, the Corporation shall be in default of the payment of the equivalent of six full quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) on any series of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or declared, the holders of Preferred Stock of all series, voting separately as a class without regard to series, shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall not have or exercise such special class voting rights except at meetings of such shareholders for the election of directors at which the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock of all series then outstanding are present in person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting rights provided for in this paragraph, when the same shall have become vested, shall remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock of all series then outstanding shall have been paid, whereupon the holders of Preferred Stock shall be divested of this special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in the event of the occurrence of the default hereinabove specified in this Subsection (b). In the event of a default entitling the holders of Preferred Stock to elect two Directors as specified in this Subsection (b), a special meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing such directors shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called by, the holders of record of at least 10% of the shares of Preferred Stock of all series at the time outstanding, and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be held within 120 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the holders of Preferred Stock. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect Directors, the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock of all series, present 7
in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect the members of the Board of Directors which the holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to elect as hereinabove provided. Notwithstanding any provision of these Amended Articles of Incorporation or the Code of Regulations of the Corporation or any action taken by the holders of any class of shares fixing the number of Directors of the Corporation, the two Directors who may be elected by the holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Subsection (b) shall serve in addition to any other Directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection (b). Nothing in this Subsection (b) shall present any change otherwise permitted in the total number of Directors of the Corporation or require the resignation of any Director elected otherwise than pursuant to this Subsection (b). Notwithstanding any classification of the other Directors of the Corporation, the two Directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. (c) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting or consenting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the following (but so far as the holders of Preferred Stock are concerned, such action may be effected with such vote or consent): (1) Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the Amended Articles of Incorporation or of the Code of Regulations of the Corporation which adversely affects the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Preferred Stock; provided, however, that for the purpose of this Subsection (c) only, neither the Amendment of the Amended Articles of Incorporation so as to authorize, create or change the authorized or outstanding amount of Preferred Stock or of any shares of any class ranking on a parity with or junior to the Preferred Stock nor the amendment of the provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to change the number of directors of the Corporation shall be deemed to affect adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of the holders of Preferred Stock; and provided further, that if such amendment, alteration or repeal affects adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of one or more but not all series of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, only the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the number of the shares at the time outstanding of the series so affected shall be required; (2) The purchase or redemption (for sinking fund purposes or otherwise) of less than all of the Preferred Stock then outstanding expect in accordance with a stock purchase offer made to all holders of record of Preferred Stock, unless all dividends on all Preferred Stock then outstanding for all previous dividend periods shall have been declared and paid for funds therefor set apart and all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable thereto shall have been complied with; or (3) The authorization, creation or the increase in the authorized amount of any shares of any class or any security convertible into shares of any class, in either case ranking prior to the Preferred Stock. (d) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting or consenting separately as a class, given in person or by proxy either in writing or at a meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the following (but so far as the holders of Preferred Stock are concerned, such action may be effected with such vote or consent): (1) The sale, lease or conveyance by the Corporation of all or substantially all of its property or business; 8
(2) The consolidation of the Corporation with or its merger into any other corporation, unless the corporation resulting from such consolidation or surviving such merger will not have after such consolidation or merger any class of shares either authorized or outstanding ranking prior to or on a parity with the Preferred Stock except the same number of shares ranking prior to or on a parity with the Preferred Stock and having the same rights and preferences as the shares of the Corporation authorized and outstanding immediately preceding such consolidation or merger (and each holder of Preferred Stock immediately preceding such consolidation or merger shall receive the same number of shares with the same rights and preferences of the resulting or surviving corporation); or (3) The authorization of any shares ranking on a parity with the Preferred Stock or an increase in the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock. (e) Neither the vote, consent nor any adjustment of the voting rights of holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be required for an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock authorized or issued or for stock splits of the Common Stock or for stock dividends on any class of stock payable solely in Common Stock; and none of the foregoing action shall be deemed to affect adversely the preferences or voting or other rights of Preferred stock within the meaning and for the purpose of this Part B. Section 6. Convertible Series. If and to the extent that there are created series of Preferred Stock which are convertible (hereinafter referred to as "convertible series") into shares of Common Stock or into shares of any other class or series of the Corporation (hereinafter collectively called "conversion shares"), the following terms and provisions shall be applicable to all convertible series, except as may be otherwise expressly provided in the terms of any such series. (a) The holder of each share of a convertible series may exercise the conversion privilege in respect thereof by delivering to any transfer agent for the respective series the certificate for the share to be converted and written notice that the holder elects to convert such share. Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date when such delivery is made, and such date is referred to in this Section as the "conversion date". On the conversion date or as promptly thereafter as practicable, the Corporation shall deliver to the holder of the stock surrendered for conversion, or as otherwise directed by him in writing, a certificate for the number of full conversion shares deliverable upon the conversion of such stock and a check or cash in respect of any fraction of a share as provided in subsection (b) of this Section 6. The person in whose name the stock certificate is to be registered shall be deemed to have become a holder of the conversion shares of record on the conversion date. No adjustment shall be made for any dividends on shares of stock surrendered for conversion or for dividends on the conversion shares delivered on conversion. (b) The Corporation shall not be required to deliver fractional shares upon conversion of shares of a convertible series. If more than one share shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full conversion shares deliverable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares so surrendered. If any fractional interest in a conversion share would otherwise be deliverable upon the conversion, the Corporation shall in lieu of delivering a fractional share therefor make an adjustment therefor in cash at the current market value thereof, computed (to the nearest cent) on the basis of the closing price of the conversion share on the last business day before the conversion date. For the purpose of this Section, the "closing price of the conversion share" on any business day shall be the last reported sales price regular way per share on such day, or, in 9
case no such reported sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices regular way, in either case on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if the conversion shares are not then listed or admitted to trading on such Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which the conversion shares are listed or admitted to trading as determined by the Board of Directors, or if not so listed or admitted, the mean between the average bid and asked prices per conversion shares in the over-the-counter market as furnished by any member of the National Association of Securities Dealers or other nationally recognized organization of securities dealers selected from time to time by the Board of Directors for that purpose; and "business day" shall be each day on which the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange or over-the-counter market used for the purposes of the above calculation is open for trading. (c) Upon conversion of shares of any convertible series, the stated capital of the conversion shares delivered upon such conversion shall be the aggregate par value of the shares so delivered having par value, or, in the case of shares without par value, shall be an amount equal to the stated capital represented by each such share outstanding at the time of such conversion multiplied by the number of such shares delivered upon such conversion. The stated capital of the Corporation shall be correspondingly increased or reduced to reflect the difference between the stated capital of the shares of the convertible series so converted and the stated capital of the shares delivered upon such conversion. (d) In the event of any reclassification or change of outstanding conversion shares (except a split or combination, or a change in par value, or a change from par value to no par value, or a change from no par value to par value), provision shall be made as part of the terms of such reclassification or change that the holder of each share of each convertible series then outstanding shall have the right to receive upon the conversion of such share, at the conversion rate or price which otherwise would be in effect at the time of conversion, with substantially the same protection against dilution as is provided in the terms of such convertible series, the same kind and amount of stock and other securities and property as he would have owned or have been entitled to receive upon the happening of any of the events described above had such share been converted immediately prior to the happening of the event. (e) In the event the Corporation shall be consolidated with or shall merge into any other corporation, provision shall be made as a part of the terms of such consolidation or merger whereby the holder of each share of each convertible series outstanding immediately prior to such event shall thereafter be entitled to such rights with respect to securities of the Corporation resulting from such consolidation or merger so that rights of such holders as specified in the terms of such convertible series shall not be substantially prejudiced; provided, however, that the provisions of this Subsection (e) shall be inapplicable if such consolidation or merger shall be approved by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of such convertible series of Preferred Stock. (f) The Corporation hereby reserves and shall at all times reserve and keep available free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares, for the purpose of delivery upon conversion of shares of each convertible series, such number of conversion shares as shall from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of all convertible series of Preferred Stock. Section 7. Preemptive Rights - Purchase of Shares by Corporation. (a) No holder of Preferred stock, present, past or future, shall be entitled as such as a matter of right to subscribe for or purchase any part of any new or additional stock of any series or class or of securities of the Corporation convertible into stock of any class whatsoever, whether now or hereafter authorized, and whether issued for cash, property, services or otherwise. 10
(b) The Corporation is authorized to purchase any shares of any series of Preferred Stock from time to time and at such times, in such manner, for such reasons and on such terms and conditions as shall be deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. Section 8. Definitions. For the purpose of this Part B: Whenever reference is made to shares "ranking prior to the Preferred Stock," such reference shall mean and include all shares of the Corporation in respect of which the rights of the holders thereof either as to the payment of dividends or as to distribution in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are given preference over the right of the holders of Preferred Stock; whenever reference is made to shares "on a parity with the Preferred Stock", such reference shall mean and include all shares of the Corporation in respect of which the right of the holders thereof (i) are not given preference over the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to distributions in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and (ii) either as to the payment of dividends or as to distributions in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, or as to both, rank on an equality (except as to the amounts fixed therefor) with the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock; and whenever reference is made to shares "ranking junior to the Preferred Stock" such reference shall mean and include all shares of the Corporation in respect of which the rights of the holders thereof both as to the payment of dividends and as to distributions in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are junior and subordinate to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, said Hoyt M. Wells, President, and James Boyazis, Secretary, of THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY, acting for and on behalf of said corporation, have hereunto subscribed their names and caused the seal of said corporation to be hereunto affixed this 6th day of April, 1993.

EXHIBIT 3.1 Continued CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT TO AMENDED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OF THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY Samir F. Gibara, President, and James Boyazis, Secretary, of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, an Ohio corporation, with its principal office located at Akron, Summit County, Ohio, do hereby certify that, pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of said corporation by Section 1 of Part B of ARTICLE FOURTH of the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the said corporation and by the Ohio General Corporation Law, at a meeting of the Board of Directors of said corporation duly called and held on the 4th day of June, 1996, at which meeting a quorum of the Board of Directors was at all times present, the Board of Directors was without shareholder action, which shareholder action was not required, the following resolution: RESOLVED, that The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company hereby adopts the following amendment to its Amended Articles of Incorporation, as amended to date, and that the Chairman of the Board, the President or a Vice President and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company are hereby authorized and directed to sign and file in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio a certificate containing a copy of the resolution adopting the amendment and a statement of the manner of its adoption: The Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company are hereby amended to create a new series of Preferred Stock by adding a new Section 1-B to PART B of ARTICLE FOURTH as follows: Section 1-B. Series B Preferred Stock, Without Par Value. A series of Preferred Stock is hereby created having the following terms: 1. Designation. The shares of such series are designated as: "Series B Preferred Stock, without par value." 2. Authorized Number of Shares - Fractional Shares. The authorized number of shares constituting the Series B Preferred Stock is 7,000,000. Series B Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series B Preferred Stock. 3. Dividends and Distributions. (A) Subject to any prior and superior rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series B Preferred Stock with 1
respect to dividends that may be authorized by the Amended Articles of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled prior to the payment of any dividends on shares ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of January, April, July and October in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater (a) $25.00 or (b) subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after July 29, 1996 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $25.00 per share on the Series B Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. (D) Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, 2
which record date shall be no more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. (E) Dividends in full shall not be declared or paid or set apart for payment on the Series B Preferred Stock for a dividend period terminating on the quarterly Dividend Payment Date unless dividends in full have been declared or paid or set apart for payment on the Preferred Stock of all series (other than series with respect to which dividends are not cumulative from a date prior to such dividend date) on such dividend date. When the dividends are not paid in full on all series of the Preferred Stock, the shares of all series shall share ratably in the payment of dividends, including accumulations, if any, in accordance with the sums which would be payable on such shares if all dividends were declared and paid in full. 4. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up (A) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have received $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "Series B Liquidation Preference"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series B Liquidation Preference, no additional distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series B Liquidation Preference by (ii) 100 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series B Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock respectively, holders of Series B Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively. (B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series B Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock. (C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of 3
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 5. Conversion on Merger, Consolidation, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any merger, consolidation, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall at the time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 6. Redemption. The outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable. 7. Condition to Issuance of any other Series. The Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be further amended to provide for the issuance of any other series of Preferred Stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting separately as one voting group.

Exhibit 3.2 ================================================================================ THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY ---------- CODE OF REGULATIONS ---------- ADOPTED NOVEMBER 22, 1955 AS AMENDED APRIL 5, 1965, APRIL 7, 1980, APRIL 6, 1981, APRIL 13, 1987, MAY 7, 2003, APRIL 26, 2005 AND APRIL 11, 2006 ================================================================================
CODE OF REGULATIONS ARTICLE I SHAREHOLDERS SECTION 1. Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of shareholders of the Company for the election of directors, the consideration of reports to be laid before such meeting, and the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before such meeting, shall be held at the principal office of the Company in Akron, Ohio, at ten o'clock a.m., or at such other time as may be designated by the Board of Directors, by the Chairman of the Board, or by the President and specified in the notice of the meeting, on the first Monday of April in each year, unless the Board of Directors by a resolution adopted on or before the first day of March of any year, shall fix a different date, which date may be any day, other than a Sunday or a legal holiday, during the period beginning April 1 and ending April 15 of such year, in which event the meeting shall be held on the date set by such resolution. SECTION 2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders of the Company may be held on any business day, when called by the Chairman of the Board, or by the President, or by a Vice President, or by the Board acting at a meeting, or by a majority of the directors acting without a meeting, or by the persons who hold twenty-five percent of all shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereat. Upon request in writing delivered either in person or by registered mail to the President or the Secretary by any persons entitled to call a meeting of shareholders, such officer shall forthwith cause to be given to the shareholders entitled thereto notice of a meeting to be held on a date not less than seven or more than sixty days after the receipt of such request, as such officer may fix. If such notice is not given within thirty days after the delivery or mailing of such request, the persons calling the meeting may fix the time of the meeting and give notice thereof in the manner provided by law or as provided in these Regulations, or cause such notice to be given by any designated representative. Each special meeting shall be called to convene between nine o'clock a.m. and four o'clock p.m. and shall be held at the principal office of the Company in Akron, Ohio, unless the same is called by the directors, acting with or without a meeting, in which case such meeting may be held at any place either within or without the State of Ohio designated by the directors and specified in the notice of such meeting. SECTION 3. Notice of Meetings. Not less than seven or more than sixty days before the date fixed for a meeting of shareholders, written notice stating the time, place, and purposes of such meeting shall be given by or at the direction of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or any other person or persons required or permitted by these Regulations to give such notice. The notice shall be given by personal delivery, by mail, by overnight delivery service or by any other means of communication authorized by the shareholder to whom notice is given, to each shareholder entitled to notice of the meeting 2
who is of record as of the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if a record date therefor is duly fixed, of record as of said date; if mailed or sent by overnight delivery service, the notice shall be addressed to the shareholders at their respective addresses as they appear on the records of the Company. If sent by any other means of communication authorized by the shareholder, the notice shall be sent to the address furnished by the shareholder for those transmissions. Notice of the time, place, and purposes of any meeting of shareholders may be waived in writing, either before or after the holding of such meeting, by any shareholder, which writing shall be filed with or entered upon the records of the meeting. SECTION 4. Quorum; Adjournment. Except as may be otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation, at any meeting of the shareholders the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of the Company present in per- son or by proxy shall constitute a quorum for such meeting; provided, however, that no action required by law, the Articles, or these Regulations to be authorized or taken by a designated proportion of the shares of the Company may be authorized or taken by a lesser proportion; and provided, further, that the holders of a majority of the voting shares represented thereat, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn such meeting from time to time; if any meeting is adjourned, notice of such adjournment need not be given if the time and place to which it is adjourned are fixed and announced at such meeting. SECTION 5. Proxies. Persons entitled to vote shares or to act with respect to shares may vote or act in person or by proxy. The person appointed as proxy need not be a share- holder. SECTION 6. Approval and Ratification of Acts of Officers and Board. Except as otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or by law, any contract, act, or transaction, prospective or past, of the Company, or of the Board, or of the officers may be approved or ratified by the affirmative vote at a meeting of the shareholders, or by the written consent, with or without a meeting, of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of the Company, and such approval or ratification shall be as valid and binding as though affirmatively voted for or consented to by every shareholder of the Company. ARTICLE II BOARD OF DIRECTORS SECTION 1. Number; Authority. The Board of Directors shall be composed of eleven members unless the number of members of the Board of Directors is changed by action of the shareholders taken in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, the Articles of Incorporation and these Regulations or by a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office. The directors may, from time to time, increase or decrease the number of directors, provided that the directors shall not increase the number of directors to more than fifteen persons or decrease the number of 3
directors to less than nine persons. Any director's office that is created by an increase in the number of directors pursuant to action taken by the Board of Directors may be filled by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office. No reduction in the number of directors by action taken by the shareholders or the directors shall, of itself, shorten the term or result in the removal of any incumbent director. Except where the law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Regulations require action to be authorized or taken by the shareholders, all of the authority of the Company shall be exercised by the directors. SECTION 2. Election of Directors; Term of Office. At each annual meeting of shareholders, or at a special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors, each director shall be elected for a term of one year and shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders following his or her election as a director and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office or death. At a meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected, only persons nominated as candidates shall be eligible for election as directors and the candidates receiving the greatest number of votes shall be elected. SECTION 3. Vacancies; Resignations; Removal of Directors. In the event of the occurrence of any vacancy or vacancies in the Board, however caused, the remaining directors, though less than a majority of the whole authorized number of directors, may, by the vote of a majority of their number, fill any such vacancy for the unexpired term of the class in which such vacancy occurred. Any director may resign at any time by oral statement to that effect made at a meeting of the Board or in a writing to that effect delivered to the Secretary, such resignation to take effect immediately or at such other time as the director may specify. All the directors, or all the directors of a particular class, or any individual director, may be removed from office by the vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise two-thirds of the voting power of the Company entitled to vote to elect directors in place of the director or directors to be removed, provided that unless all the directors, or all the directors of a particular class, are removed, no individual director shall be removed if the votes of a sufficient number of shares are cast against such director's removal which, if cumulatively voted at an election of all the directors, or all of the directors of a particular class, as the case may be, would be sufficient to elect at least one director; provided further, that, if shareholders do not have the right to vote cumulatively under the law of Ohio or the Articles of Incorporation, such directors, class of directors or individual director may be removed from office by the vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise two-thirds of the voting power of the Company entitled to vote to elect directors in place of the director or directors to be removed. In the event of any such removal, a new director may be elected at the same meeting for the unexpired term of each director removed. Failure to elect a director to fill the unexpired term of any director so removed from office shall be deemed to create a vacancy in the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding Article X of these Regulations, the provisions of this Section 3 of Article II may be amended, repealed or supplemented only by the shareholders at a meeting held for such purpose by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise two-thirds of the voting power of the Company on such proposal. 4
SECTION 4. Meetings. Immediately after each annual meeting of the shareholders, the newly elected directors shall hold an organization meeting for the purpose of electing officers and transacting any other business. Notice of such meeting need not be given. Other meetings of the Board may be held at any time within or without the State of Ohio in accordance with the bylaws, resolutions, or other action by the Board. Unless otherwise expressly stated in the notice thereof, any business may be transacted at any meeting of the Board. SECTION 5. Quorum; Adjournment. A quorum of the Board shall consist of a majority of the directors then in office; provided that a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn such meeting from time to time; if any meeting is adjourned, notice of adjournment need not be given if the time and place to which it is adjourned are fixed and announced at such meeting. At each meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present, all questions and business shall be determined by a majority vote of those present except as in these Regulations otherwise expressly provided. SECTION 6. Committees. The Board may from time to time create or appoint an Executive Committee, a Finance Committee, a combined Executive and Finance Committee, and any other committee or committees deemed advisable by the Board for the proper transaction of the Company's business. Any such committee shall be composed of not less than three directors (not less than five directors in the case of an Executive and Finance Committee), each of whom shall serve at the pleasure of, and be subject at all times to the control and direction of, the Board. Any such committee shall act only in the intervals between meetings of the Board and shall have such authority as adheres to the committee by virtue of the provisions of this section or as may, from time to time, be delegated by the Board, except that no committee shall have authority to fill vacancies in the Board or in any committee of the Board. Subject to the aforesaid exceptions, and in the absence of express delegation of authority by the Board, the Executive Committee may transact all business and do and perform all things which may or might be transacted or done by the Board, the Finance Committee shall have the authority usually and ordinarily possessed by finance committees, and the combined Executive and Finance Committee shall have the aforesaid authority of the Executive Committee and of the Finance Committee. Subject to the aforesaid exceptions with respect to the filling of vacancies in the Board or in any committee, any person dealing with the Company shall be entitled to rely upon any act of, or authorization of any act by, such committees, to the same extent as an act or authorization of the Board. Each committee shall keep full and complete records of all meetings and actions, which shall be open to inspection by the directors. Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, any such committee may prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings, and for its own method of procedure, and may act by a majority of its members at a meeting or without a meeting by a writing or writings signed by all of its members. The directors may appoint one or more alternate members of any such committee to take the place of any absent member or members at any meeting of such committee and, if permitted by law, to join in any action of such committee authorized or taken without a meeting; each such alternate shall serve at the pleasure of, and be subject at 5
all times to the control and direction of, the Board. SECTION 7. Bylaws. The Board may adopt bylaws for its own government, not inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation or these Regulations. ARTICLE III OFFICERS SECTION 1. Election and Designation of Officers. The Board, at its organization meeting, may elect a Chairman of the Board and shall elect a President, a Secretary, a Treasurer, and, in its discretion, at any meeting of the Board, may elect one or more Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries, one or more Assistant Treasurers, a Comptroller, one or more Assistant Comptrollers, and such other officers as the Board may deem necessary. The Chairman of the Board and the President shall be directors, but no one of the other officers need be a director. Any two or more of such offices may be held by the same person, but no officer shall execute, acknowledge, or verify any instrument in more than one capacity, if such instrument is required to be executed, acknowledged, or verified by two or more officers. SECTION 2. Term of Office; Vacancies. The officers of the Company shall hold office until the next organization meeting of the Board and until their successors are elected, except in case of resignation, death, or removal. The Board may remove any officer at any time with or without cause by a two-thirds vote of the members of the Board then in office. Any vacancy in any office may be filled by the Board. SECTION 3. Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of the Board, if any, shall preside at all meetings of shareholders and of the Board and shall have such authority and perform such duties as the Board may determine. SECTION 4. President. Except for meetings at which the Chairman of the Board, if any, presides in accordance with the preceding Section, the President shall preside at all meetings of shareholders and of the Board. Subject to directions of the Board, he shall have general executive supervision over the property, business, and affairs of the Company. SECTION 5. Vice Presidents. In case of the absence or disability of the President, or when circumstances prevent the President from acting, the Vice Presidents of the Company shall perform all the duties and possess all the authority of the President, and shall have priority in the performance of such duties and exercise of such authority in the order of their election by the Board. SECTION 6. Secretary. The Secretary shall keep the minutes of meetings of the shareholders and of the Board. He shall keep such books as may be required by the Board, and shall give notices of shareholders' meetings and of Board meetings required by law, or by these Regulations, or otherwise. SECTION 7. Treasurer. The Treasurer shall receive and have in charge all money, 6
bills, notes, bonds, stocks in other corporations, and similar property belonging to the Company, and shall do with the same as may be ordered by the Board. He shall keep accurate financial accounts and hold the same open for the inspection and examination of the directors. SECTION 8. Comptroller. The Comptroller shall exercise a general check upon the disbursement of funds of the Company and shall have general charge and supervision of the preparation of financial reports. SECTION 9. Other Officers. The Assistant Secretaries, Assistant Treasurers, and Assistant Comptrollers, if any, in addition to such authority and duties as the Board may determine, shall have such authority and perform such duties as may be directed by their respective principal officers. SECTION 10. Authority and Duties. The officers shall have such authority and perform such duties, in addition to those specifically set forth in these Regulations, as the Board may determine. The Board is authorized to delegate the duties of any officer to any other officer and generally to control the action of the officers and to require the performance of duties in addition to those mentioned herein. ARTICLE IV COMPENSATION The Board, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors in office, and irrespective of any personal interest of any of them, shall have authority to establish reasonable compensation, which may include pension, disability and death benefits, for services to the Company by directors and officers, or to delegate such authority to one or more officers or directors. ARTICLE V INDEMNIFICATION The Company shall indemnify each person who is or was director, officer or employee of the Company, or of any other corporation which he served as such at the request of the Company, against any and all liability and reasonable expense that may be incurred by him in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding (whether brought by or in the right of the Company or such other corporation or otherwise), civil or criminal, or in connection with an appeal relating thereto, in which he may become involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of his being or having been a director, officer, or employee of the Company or of such other corporation, or by reason of any past or future action taken or not taken in his capacity as such director, officer, or employee, whether or not he continues to be such at the time such liability or expense is 7
incurred, provided such person acted, in good faith, in what he reasonably believed to be the best interests of the Company or such other corporation, as the case may be, and, in addition, in any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. As used in this Article, the terms "liability" and "expense" shall include, but shall not be limited to, counsel fees and disbursements and amounts of judgments, fines, or penalties against, and amounts paid in settlement by, a director, officer, or employee, other than amounts paid to the Company itself or to such other corporation served at the Company's request. The termination of any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, civil or criminal, by judgment, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction or upon a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that a director, officer, or employee did not meet the standards of conduct set forth in the first sentence of this Article. Any such director, officer, or employee referred to in this Article who has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, with respect to any claim, action, suit, or proceeding of the character described herein shall be entitled to indemnification as of right. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, any indemnification hereunder shall be made at the discretion of the Company, but only if (1) the Board, acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to (or who have been wholly successful with respect to) such claim, action, suit, or proceeding, shall find that the director, officer, or employee has met the standards of conduct set forth in the first sentence of this Article, or (2) independent legal counsel (who may be the regular counsel of the Company) shall deliver to it their written advice that, in their opinion, such director, officer, or employee has met such standards. Expense incurred with respect to any such claim, action, suit, or proceeding may be advanced by the Company prior to the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the recipient to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to indemnification under this Article. The rights of indemnification provided in this Article shall be in addition to any rights to which any person concerned may otherwise be entitled by contract or as a matter of law, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of any such person. ARTICLE VI RECORD DATES For any lawful purpose, including, without limitation, the determination of the shareholders who are entitled to: (1) receive notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, (2) receive payment of any dividend or distribution, (3) receive or exercise rights of purchase of or subscription for, or exchange or conversion of, shares or other securities, subject to contract rights with respect thereto, or (4) participate in the execution of written consents, waivers, or releases, the Board may fix a record date which shall not be a date earlier than the date on which the 8
record date is fixed and, in the cases provided for in clauses (1), (2), and (3) above, shall not be more than sixty days preceding the date of the meeting of shareholders, or the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or distribution, or the date fixed for the receipt or the exercise of rights, as the case may be. The record date for the purpose of the determination of the shareholders who are entitled to receive notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall continue to be the record date for all adjournments of such meeting, unless the Board or the persons who shall have fixed the original record date shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article, fix another date, and in case a new record date is so fixed, notice thereof and of the date to which the meeting shall have been adjourned shall be given to shareholders of record as of such date in accordance with the same requirements as those applying to a meeting newly called. The Board may close the share transfer books against transfers of shares during the whole or any part of the period provided for in this Article, including the date of the meeting of shareholders and the period ending with the date, if any, to which adjourned. ARTICLE VII EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS Except as otherwise provided in these Regulations, or by specific or general resolutions of the Board, all documents evidencing conveyances by or contracts or other obligations of the Company shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President, or a Vice President, and attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. ARTICLE VIII CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES SECTION 1. Form of Certificates and Signatures. Each holder of shares is entitled to one or more certificates, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or a Vice President and by the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, the Treasurer, or an Assistant Treasurer of the Company, which shall certify the number and class of shares held by him in the Company, but no certificate for shares shall be executed or delivered until such shares are fully paid. When such a certificate is countersigned by an incorporated transfer agent or registrar, the signature of any of said officers of the Company may be facsimile, engraved, stamped, or printed. Although any officer of the Company whose manual or facsimile signature is affixed to such a certificate so countersigned ceases to be such officer before the certificate is delivered, such certificate nevertheless shall be effective in all respects when delivered. SECTION 2. Transfer of Shares. Shares of the Company shall be transferable upon the books of the Company by the holders thereof, in person, or by a duly authorized attorney, upon surrender and cancellation of certificates for a like number of shares of the same class or series, with duly executed assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, and with such proof of the authenticity of the signatures to such assignment and power of transfer as the Company or its agents may reasonably require. 9
SECTION 3. Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. The Company may issue a new certificate for shares in place of any certificate theretofore issued by it and alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, and the Board may, in its discretion, require the owner, or his legal representatives, to give the Company a bond containing such terms as the Board may require to protect the Company or any person injured by the execution and delivery of a new certificate. SECTION 4. Transfer Agents and Registrars. The Board may appoint, or revoke the appointment of, transfer agents and registrars and may require all certificates for shares to bear the signatures of such transfer agents and registrars, or any of them. The Board shall have authority to make all such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer, and registration of certificates for shares of the Company. ARTICLE IX AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER AND VOTE SECURITIES The Chairman of the Board, the President, and a Vice President of the Company are each authorized to sign the name of the Company and to perform all acts necessary to effect a transfer of any shares, bonds, other evidences of indebtedness or obligations, subscription rights, warrants, and other securities of another corporation owned by the Company and to issue the necessary powers of attorney for the same; and each such officer is authorized, on behalf of the Company, to vote such securities, to appoint proxies with respect thereto, and to execute consents, waivers, and releases with respect thereto, or to cause any such action to be taken. ARTICLE X AMENDMENTS The Regulations of the Company may be amended or new Regulations may be adopted by the shareholders, at a meeting held for such purpose by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power of the Company on such proposal or, without a meeting, by the written consent of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise two-thirds of the voting power on such proposal. 10
