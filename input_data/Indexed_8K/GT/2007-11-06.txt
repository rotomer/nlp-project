FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AKRON, Ohio, November 6, 2007  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company announced today that it has commenced an offer to exchange any and all of its outstanding 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2034 for a cash premium and shares of its common stock.
"This exchange offer is another step in our plan to further de-lever and improve our capital structure," said W. Mark Schmitz, executive vice president and chief financial officer. "This allows us to reduce our debt by as much as $350 million, save up to $14 million a year in interest and simplify our balance sheet."
The exchange offer allows holders of convertible notes to receive the same number of shares of the company's common stock as they would receive upon conversion of the convertible notes in accordance with their current terms, plus a cash premium and accrued and unpaid interest.
For each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes validly tendered, note holders will receive 83.0703 shares of the company's common stock, which represents a conversion price of approximately $12.04 per share. In addition, per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, the company will offer note holders a cash payment of $48.30 as well as accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the exchange date.
The offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 5, 2007. As of November 6, 2007, there was $349,798,000 principal amount of convertible notes outstanding.
Copies of the prospectus may be obtained from the exchange agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Corporate Trust Operations, Sixth and Marquette, MAC N0303-121, Minneapolis, Minn. 55479, telephone (800) 344-5128. Goodyear has engaged Goldman, Sachs & Co., telephone (800) 828-3182, to act as dealer manager in connection with the exchange offer.
Holders of convertible notes are urged to read the prospectus and related exchange offer materials when they become available because they contain important information. The prospectus and other related documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission may be obtained free of charge from the exchange agent or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov.
A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
