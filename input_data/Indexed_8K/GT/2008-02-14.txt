Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (d)  Exhibits
     99.1  News release, dated February 14, 2008
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
     AKRON, Ohio, February 14, 2008  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company today reported record sales for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2007.
     Goodyear's fourth quarter 2007 sales were $5.2 billion, an 11 percent increase compared with the 2006 quarter, offsetting lower volumes with higher prices and a richer product mix. The company estimates that a 12-week strike at its North American facilities in 2006 reduced fourth quarter 2006 sales by $318 million.
     Improved pricing and product mix drove revenue per tire up 10 percent over the 2006 quarter. Lower volumes reflect weak winter tire sale demand in Europe and the company's exit from certain segments of the private label tire business in North America along with weak conditions in several key markets.
     "Our fourth quarter results show significant gains as we drive sales of our higher-margin premium product lines," said Robert J. Keegan, chairman and chief executive officer.
     "This is especially true in our emerging markets businesses in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. In aggregate, these three businesses grew sales 20 percent and segment operating income 41 percent in the quarter," he said.
     "Excluding the impact of the strike, North American Tire's focus on innovative new products helped it achieve its highest full-year segment operating income since 2000," he said. "Our new product engine will provide additional growth opportunities in 2008 and beyond."
 
     Goodyear made further progress during the fourth quarter on its plan to achieve $1.8 billion to $2 billion in gross cost savings by the end of 2009. "We have now achieved more than $1 billion in savings in 2006 and 2007 and clearly remain on target to reach our four-year goal," Keegan said.
     "During 2007, we also made substantial progress on improving our balance sheet with net debt decreasing more than $2 billion," he said. "We remain on track to achieve our next stage financial metrics, which include an 8 percent segment operating income return on sales globally, a 5 percent segment operating income return on sales in North America and a target of 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA."
     Fourth quarter segment operating income was $313 million in 2007. This compares to a segment operating loss of $86 million in the strike-impacted 2006 period.
     Segment operating income benefited from improved pricing and product mix of $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, which more than offset increased raw material costs of $8 million.
     Favorable foreign currency translation positively impacted sales by $315 million and segment operating income by $45 million in the quarter.
     Gross margin was 19.4 percent for the 2007 quarter compared to 11.3 percent in last year's strike-impacted quarter.
     Fourth quarter 2007 income from continuing operations was $61 million (27 cents per share). This compares to a loss of $310 million ($1.74 per share) in the strike-impacted fourth quarter of 2006.
     Including discontinued operations, Goodyear had fourth quarter net income of $52 million (23 cents per share), compared to a net loss of $358 million ($2.02 per share) last year. All per share amounts are diluted.
     The 2007 fourth quarter included $26 million (11 cents per share) in after-tax rationalization and accelerated depreciation, after-tax losses on asset sales of $19 million (8 cents per share), after-tax financing fees of $17 million (7 cents per share) related to debt conversion and reduced tax expense of $11 million (4 cents per share) due to a tax law change.
     The 2006 fourth quarter included the strike impact of $313 million ($1.77 per share); $184 million ($1.03 per share) in after-tax charges for rationalization, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs principally related to plant closures; and a gain of $153 million (86 cents per share) related to the favorable resolution of a tax contingency.
 
     See the table at the end of this release for a list of significant items impacting continuing operations from the 2007 and 2006 fourth quarters.
Business Segments
     All four of the company's tire businesses outside of North America achieved all-time record sales during the 2007 fourth quarter.
     Segment operating income for the Latin America, Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa units were fourth quarter records.
     See the disclosure at the end of this release for further explanation and a segment operating income reconciliation table.
     North American Tire's fourth quarter 2007 sales increased 10 percent over the strike-impacted 2006 period. The company estimates the USW strike reduced sales in the 2006 quarter by $318 million.
     In addition, 2007 fourth quarter sales reflect the company's exit from certain segments of the private label tire market and continued weakness in both the replacement and original equipment markets. This was offset by improved pricing and product mix as well as market share gains in Goodyear and Dunlop brand tires.
     Fourth quarter segment operating income was significantly improved compared to the strike-impacted 2006 period. The company estimates the strike reduced segment operating income by $313 million in the 2006 quarter.
     European Union Tire's fourth quarter sales set a record for any quarter, increasing 5 percent over last year due to improved pricing and product mix and foreign currency translation, which more than offset the impact of lower volumes, primarily due to weak winter tire demand.
 
     Fourth quarter segment operating income was flat versus last year, as $48 million in improved pricing and product mix and $10 million of favorable foreign currency translation were offset by volume declines and manufacturing inefficiencies in France. Raw material costs increased $1 million compared to the prior year.
     Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire's fourth quarter sales reflected a record for any quarter and a 20 percent increase over the 2006 period primarily due to higher replacement tire volume and strong sales in Russia.
     Segment operating income set a fourth quarter record and increased 34 percent due to improved pricing and product mix of $19 million. Raw material costs decreased approximately $5 million compared to the prior year.
     Latin American Tire's fourth quarter sales reflected a record for any quarter and increased 24 percent compared to 2006, driven by higher volume in original equipment markets as well as improvements in pricing and product mix and foreign currency translation.
     Segment operating income increased 44 percent, reflecting the volume increases, currency translation and $21 million in improved pricing and product mix. Raw material costs increased $9 million compared to the 2006 period.
 
     Asia Pacific Tire's fourth quarter sales were a record for any quarter, increasing 16 percent over 2006, driven by growth in China and India as well as improvements in pricing and product mix and higher volume.
     Segment operating income was a fourth quarter record and 50 percent higher than 2006 due to pricing and product mix improvements of $13 million as well as foreign currency translation. Raw material costs decreased approximately $3 million compared to the prior year.
Full-Year Results
     Goodyear's sales for 2007 were a record $19.6 billion, a 5 percent increase over 2006 despite a 6.2 percent decline in tire unit volume.
     All four of the company's tire businesses outside of North America achieved all-time record annual sales during 2007.
     Segment operating income was $1.2 billion, compared to $712 million in 2006.
     Goodyear's income from continuing operations of $139 million (65 cents per share) in 2007 compares to a 2006 loss of $373 million ($2.11 per share).
     Including discontinued operations, Goodyear had 2007 net income of $602 million ($2.65 per share), compared to a loss of $330 million ($1.86 per share) last year. All per share amounts are diluted.
     Improvements in pricing and product mix of approximately $639 million offset higher raw material costs, which increased 3.5 percent, or approximately $195 million, compared to 2006. Revenue per tire increased 8 percent compared to 2006.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     This earnings release presents total segment operating income and net debt, each of which are important financial measures for the company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.
     Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual strategic business units segment operating income as determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by the company's SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. See the table below for the reconciliation of total segment operating income.
     Net debt is total debt (the sum of long term debt and capital leases, notes payable, and long-term debt and capital leases due within one year) minus cash and cash equivalents. Management believes net debt is an important measure of liquidity, which it uses as a tool to assess the company's capital structure and measure its ability to meet its future debt obligations. Cash and cash equivalents are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce our debt obligations. See the table below for the reconciliation of net debt.
