Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On August 13, 2008, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company decided to exit 92 underperforming U.S. retail locations, based on a review of operating performance and local market dynamics. The decision to exit these retail locations will affect approximately 500 full-time associates and 100 part-time associates. The exit plan is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2008. The estimated charges associated with the exit plan are expected to be approximately $30 million ($30 million after-tax), of which approximately $28 million are expected to be cash charges primarily related to non-cancelable lease costs and other lease exit costs. Charges associated with the exit plan are expected to be approximately $15 million ($15 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2008, approximately $12 million ($12 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2008, and approximately $3 million ($3 million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2009. The plan is expected to eliminate net losses related to these retai l locations of approximately $9 million annually. Safe Harbor Statement Certain information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K may constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including those statements regarding the expected amounts of charges and impact on net income (loss) resulting from the plan to exit the retail locations. All forward-looking statements are based on managements estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof. There are a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, which could affect our operations, performance, business strategy and results and could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the assumptions, expectations and objectives expressed in any forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including but not limited to the risks and other factors described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent managements estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing managements estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if managements estimates change.
