Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On September 26, 2008, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company ("Goodyear") drew $600 million under its $1.5 billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2013 as a result of a temporary delay in its ability to access $360 million of cash currently invested with The Reserve Primary Fund. The funds also will be used to support seasonal working capital needs and to enhance Goodyears cash liquidity position. This borrowing under the revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum of 125 basis points over LIBOR (currently 4.68%). Goodyear previously announced its intention to make this draw in a press release dated September 25, 2008. The material terms of the revolving credit facility are described in Goodyears Form 8-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 23, 2007, and in Note 11 to Goodyears Consolidated Financial Statements included in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.
