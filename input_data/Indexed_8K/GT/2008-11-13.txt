FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
#23666fi.1108
AKRON, Ohio, November 13, 2008  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company today commented on Standard & Poor's Ratings Services' (S&P) decision to place its credit ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications as part of a broader action that included 14 auto industry-related firms.
"We're disappointed in Standard & Poors' action. There are fundamental differences between our business and the companies whose businesses are heavily tied to the Michigan-based auto manufacturers," said Darren R. Wells, Goodyear's executive vice president and chief financial officer.
"Of approximately $20 billion in total sales in 2007, less than 8 percent was with the global operations of the three Michigan-based automakers. This number will be lower given weak OE volumes in 2008. Our OE customers are important to us, but more than 80 percent of our sales are to the replacement market for consumers who already have vehicles."
Wells said the near-term impact of financial challenges among the Michigan-based automakers is not expected to be material to Goodyear's liquidity.
Goodyear is one of the world's largest tire companies. Goodyear employs about 70,000 people and manufactures its products in more than 60 facilities in 25 countries around the world. For more information about Goodyear, go to www.goodyear.com/corporate.
