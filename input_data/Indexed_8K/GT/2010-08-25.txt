Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On August 20, 2010, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (the "Underwriting Agreement") for the issuance and sale by the Company of $100 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.250% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Additional Notes"). The Additional Notes are guaranteed by the Company's U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee the Company's obligations under its senior secured credit facilities (the "Subsidiary Guarantors"). The Company registered the offering and sale of the Additional Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-168704) (the "Registration Statement"). A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is attached as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     The Additional Notes were issued on August 25, 2010 pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 13, 2010 (the "Base Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 13, 2010 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"). The Additional Notes will have the same terms as, and will be treated as the same class with, the $900 million aggregate principal amount of 8.250% Senior Notes due 2020 issued by the Company under the Indenture on August 13, 2010 (the "Existing 2020 Notes" and, together with the Additional Notes, the "Notes").
     The Indenture provides, among other things, that the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with all of the Company's other senior unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Interest is payable on the Notes on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2011. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2020. On or after August 15, 2015, the Company may redeem for cash some or all of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the Supplemental Indenture. Prior to August 15, 2015, the Company may redeem for cash some or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus the make-whole premium set forth in the Supplemental Indenture. In addition, at any time prior to August 15, 2013, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Supplemental Indenture.
     The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, if the Notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moody's and Standard & Poor's and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended.
     The Indenture provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest,

breach of covenants or other agreements in the Indenture, defaults in or failure to pay certain other indebtedness or judgments, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all of the Notes to be due and payable. In addition, in the event of a change in control, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
     Copies of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have been previously filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 13, 2010. The descriptions of the material terms of the Indenture and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibits.
     A news release dated August 20, 2010 announcing the pricing of the offering of the Additional Notes is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

          (ff) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its subsidiaries have insurance covering their respective properties, operations, personnel and businesses, which insurance is in amounts and insures against such losses and risks as are customary among companies of established reputation engaged in the same or similar businesses and operating in the same or similar locations; and neither the Company nor, to the best of the Company's knowledge, any of the its subsidiaries, has (i) received written notice from any insurer or agent of such insurer that capital improvements or other expenditures are required or necessary to be made in order to continue such insurance or (ii) any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage at reasonable cost from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business, except, in the case of clause (ii), as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
          (gg) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (a) each employee benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), that is maintained, administered or contributed to by the Company or any of its affiliates for employees or former employees of the Company and its affiliates is in compliance in all material respects with its terms and the requirements of any applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and (b) no prohibited transaction, within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred with respect to any such plan excluding transactions effected pursuant to a statutory or administrative exemption; and for the plans that are subject to the funding rules of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the present value of all benefit liabilities under each such plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715) did not, as of the last date the plans were measured for year-end disclosure purposes, exceed by more than $1,226 million the fair market value of the assets of such plan, and the present value of all benefit liabilities of all underfunded plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715) did not, as of the last date the plans were measured for year-end disclosure purposes, exceed by more than $1,843 million the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded plans, and no such plan has failed to satisfy the minimum funding standard as defined in Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.
          (hh) The Company and its subsidiaries (i) are in compliance with any and all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, regulations, decisions and orders relating to the protection of human health and safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants (collectively, "Environmental Laws"); (ii) have received and are in compliance with all permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their respective businesses; and (iii) have not received notice of any actual or potential liability for the investigation or remediation of any disposal or release of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants, except in any such case for any such failure to comply with, or failure to receive required permits, licenses or approvals, or liability, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
          (ii) None of the information on (or hyperlinked from) the Company's website at www.goodyear.com, or any website of any subsidiary of the Company maintained or supported by the Company, includes or constitutes a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act (other than any information that has been filed by the Company with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433 under the Act).
          (jj) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor, to the best knowledge of the Company and its subsidiaries, no director, officer, agent, employee or other person associated with or acting on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has (i) used any corporate funds for any unlawful contribution, gift, entertainment or other unlawful expense relating to political activity; (ii) made any direct or indirect unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government official or employee from corporate funds; (iii) violated or is in violation of any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; or (iv) made any bribe, rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment.

As used in this paragraph, the term "Solvent" means, with respect to a particular date, that on such date (i) the present fair market value (or present fair saleable value) of the assets of the Company is not less than the total amount required to pay the liabilities of the Company on its total existing debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) (which liabilities are calculated for purposes of this representation in the manner used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements) as they become absolute and matured; (ii) the Company is able to realize upon its assets and pay its debts and other liabilities, contingent obligations and commitments as they mature and become due in the normal course of business (assuming the ability to refinance existing obligations in the normal course of business); (iii) assuming consummation of the issuance of the Securities as contemplated by this Agreement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, the Company is not incurring debts or liabilities beyond its ability to pay as such debts and liabilities mature (assuming the ability to refinance existing obligations in the normal course of business); and (iv) the Company is not engaged in any business or transaction, and does not propose to engage in any business or transaction, for which its property would constitute unreasonably small capital after giving due consideration to the prevailing practice in the industry in which the Company is engaged.

2.

          (c) It is understood that the Underwriter intends to offer the Securities for sale to the public at the price set forth in the Prospectus.
 
     
3.
Covenants of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors.
     The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, covenant and agree with the Underwriter that:
          (a) The Company will (i) prepare and timely file with the Commission under Rule 424(b) (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)) under the Act the Prospectus in a form approved by the Underwriter containing information previously omitted at the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement in reliance on Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Act, (ii) during the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined below), not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or distribute an amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any document incorporated by reference therein of which the Underwriter shall not previously have been advised and furnished with a copy or to which the Underwriter shall have reasonably objected in writing or which is not in compliance with the Rules and Regulations and (iii) file on a timely basis all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and during the Prospectus Delivery Period.
          (b) The Company will (i) not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission under Rule 433 under the Act unless the Underwriter approves its use in writing prior to first use (each, a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus"); provided that the prior written consent of the Underwriter shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus(es) included in Schedule III hereto, (ii) treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, (iii) comply with the requirements of Rules 163, 164 and 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including the requirements relating to timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping and (iv) not take any action that would result in the Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriter that the Underwriter otherwise would not have been required to file thereunder.
          (c) The Company will advise the Underwriter promptly (i) when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement relating to the Securities and the Guarantees shall have become effective, or any supplement to the Prospectus shall have been filed, (ii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission relating to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, (iii) of any request of the Commission for amendment of the Registration Statement or the filing of a new registration statement relating to the Securities or the Guarantees or any amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, and (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or such new registration statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or of the institution of any proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order and to obtain as soon as possible the lifting thereof, if issued.
 
          (d) If at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Underwriter, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Securities (including the Guarantees), in a form satisfactory to the Underwriter, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable (if such filing is not otherwise effective immediately pursuant to Rule 462 under the Act), and (iv) promptly notify the Underwriter of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities (including the Guarantees) to continue as contemplated in the Registration Statement that was the subject of the notice under Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the Guarantees shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
          (e) The Company agrees to pay the required filing fees to the Commission relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Act (including, if applicable, by updating the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii), either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act).
          (f) The Company will promptly from time to time take such action as the Underwriter may reasonably request to qualify the Securities (including the Guarantees) for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriter may reasonably request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the offering and resale of the Securities (including the Guarantees), provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required (i) to qualify as a foreign corporation, (ii) to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or (iii) to take any action that would subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction if it is not otherwise so subject.
          (g) The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Underwriter, from time to time, as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Underwriter, from time to time, as many copies of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Underwriter during the period when delivery of a Prospectus (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to under Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required under the Act (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), as many copies of the Prospectus in final form, or as thereafter amended or supplemented, as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to the Underwriter at or before the Closing Date, such number of copies of the Registration Statement (including such number of copies of the exhibits filed therewith that may reasonably be requested), including documents incorporated by reference therein, and of all amendments thereto, as the Underwriter may reasonably request.
          (h) The Company will comply with the Act and the Rules and Regulations, and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, so as to permit
 
the completion of the distribution of the Securities as contemplated in this Agreement and the Prospectus. If during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriter, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or, if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (i) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or (ii) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with the law.
          (i) If the General Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriter, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or to make the statements therein not conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (i) prepare, file with the Commission (if required) and furnish to the Underwriter and any dealers an appropriate amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or (ii) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the General Disclosure Package so that the General Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or conflict with the Registration Statement then on file, or so that the General Disclosure Package will comply with law.
          (j) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as it is practicable to do so, but in any event not later than 16 months after the effective date of the Registration Statement, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) in reasonable detail, covering a period of at least 12 consecutive months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
          (k) The Company shall not, during the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing until the date 90 days after the Closing Date, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided hereunder, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors that are substantially similar to the Securities without the prior written consent of the Underwriter.
          (l) The Company shall apply the net proceeds of its sale of the Securities as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
          (m) The Company shall not be or become, at any time prior to the expiration of two years after the Closing Time, an open-end investment company, unit investment trust,
 
closed-end investment company or face-amount certificate company that is or is required to be registered under Section 8 of the 1940 Act.
          (n) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that could reasonably be expected to cause or result in any stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Securities.
      The Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that:
4.
Covenant of the Underwriter.
     It has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any "free writing prospectus", as defined in Rule 405 under the Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) a free writing prospectus that, solely as a result of use by the Underwriter, would not trigger an obligation to file such free writing prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule III or prepared pursuant to Section 3(b) above (including any electronic road show), or (iii) any free writing prospectus prepared by the Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing.
     
5.
Costs and Expenses.
     The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: accounting fees of the Company; the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; any roadshow expenses incurred by the Company for airfare, hotel and other travel expenses; the cost of printing and delivering to, or as requested by, the Underwriter copies of the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectuses, the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, the Prospectus, this Agreement, the Blue Sky Survey and any supplements or amendments thereto; the filing fees of the Commission; the filing fees and expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) incident to securing any required review by the FINRA of the terms of the sale of the Securities; and the expenses, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriter, incurred in connection with the qualification of the Securities under State securities or Blue Sky laws. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of the Underwriter's expenses (other than those related to qualification under FINRA regulations and State securities or Blue Sky laws) except that, if this Agreement shall not be consummated because the conditions in Section 6 hereof are not satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriter pursuant to Section 11 hereof, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on its part to be performed, unless such failure, refusal or inability is due primarily to the default or omission of the Underwriter, the Company shall reimburse the Underwriter for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing to market the Securities or in contemplation of performing their obligations hereunder; but the Company shall not in any event be liable to the Underwriter for damages on account of loss of anticipated profits from the sale by the Underwriter of the Securities.
 
     
6.

This indemnity agreement in this Section 8(a) will be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors may otherwise have.
          (b) The Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who
 
have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company by the Underwriter specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Underwriter may otherwise have.
          (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing. No indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or (b) shall be available to any party who shall fail to give notice as provided in this Section 8(c) if the party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, but the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on account of the provisions of Section 8(a) or (b). In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred (or within 30 days of presentation) the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party, reasonably incurred, in the event (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
 
potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel acceptable to the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time after notice of commencement of the action. Such firm shall be designated in writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. In addition, the indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to
 
above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (i) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Securities purchased by the Underwriter and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
          (e) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 8 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.
          (f) Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section 8 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are incurred. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement. A successor to the Underwriter, its directors or officers or any person controlling the Underwriter, or to the Company, its directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company, shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements contained in this Section 8.

     In addition to the matters set forth above, such opinion shall also include a statement to the effect that, in accordance with such counsel's understanding with the Goodyear Companies as to the scope of its services in connection with the offering of the Securities, as counsel to the Goodyear Companies, such counsel reviewed the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package and participated in discussions with representatives of the Underwriter and those of the Company, counsel to the Underwriter and the Company's accountants. On the basis of the information which was reviewed by such counsel in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of its understanding of the applicable law and the experience it has gained through its practice under the federal securities laws, such counsel confirms that nothing which came to its attention in the course of such review has caused such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time the Registration Statement became effective under the Act (including the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement at the time it became effective pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Such counsel may state that it does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package, except as specified in paragraph 5 above. Such counsel may also state that it does not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements, including the notes and schedules thereto, and other financial and statistical data included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package.

     1. The Goodyear Companies are each duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization and each Goodyear Company has (i) the power and authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby and to perform its respective obligations thereunder, and (ii) the requisite power and authority to own its respective properties and to conduct the businesses in which it is engaged, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Goodyear Companies is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
     2. Each of the Goodyear Companies has duly authorized, executed and delivered each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.
     3. The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in footnote [    ] to the table set forth under the caption "Capitalization" in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
     4. No consent, approval, authorization or other action by or filing with any governmental agency or instrumentality of the State of Ohio is required on the part of any Goodyear Company for the execution and delivery of any Transaction Document to which such Goodyear Company is a party, the issuance and sale of the Securities, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or the performance by such Goodyear Company of its obligations thereunder, except (i) those already obtained or made, and (ii) any of the foregoing as may be required under state securities laws or blue sky laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
     5.

The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company 1144 East Market Street Akron, Ohio 44316-0001
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and are rendering this opinion in connection with the prospectus, dated August 10, 2010 (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated August 20, 2010 (the "Prospectus Supplement" and, together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"), relating to the registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), on August 10, 2010 and the offer and sale of: (i) $100,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 8.25% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Notes") and (ii) guarantees of the Notes (the "Guarantees") by certain subsidiaries of the Company listed on Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Guarantors"), in each case to be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 13, 2010 (the "Base Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 13, 2010 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture").
     We have reviewed such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. We have assumed that all signatures are genuine, that all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and that all copies of documents submitted to us conform to the originals. We have assumed further that the Trustee has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture. We have assumed further that the Company and the Guarantors that are incorporated or formed in the State of Ohio, the State of Arizona or the province of Ontario, Canada (such Guarantors, listed on Schedule B hereto, the "Non-Covered Guarantors"), are validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which each is incorporated or formed, as applicable, and that each has the corporate or limited liability company power, authority and legal right, as applicable, to execute, deliver and perform the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees, as applicable. We have assumed further that each of the Company and the Non-Covered Guarantors has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Indenture and the Notes, as applicable. With respect to all matters of Ohio law, we note that you are relying on an opinion of David Bialosky, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, which is filed as Exhibit 5.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 25, 2010 (the "Current Report on Form 8-K"). With respect to all matters of Arizona law, we note that you are relying on an opinion of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey L.L.P., which is filed as Exhibit 5.4 to the Current Report on Form 8-K. With respect to all matters of the law of the province of Ontario, Canada, we note that you are relying on an opinion of Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP, which is filed as Exhibit 5.3 to the Current Report on Form 8-K.
     We have relied as to certain matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and the Guarantors, and other sources believed by us to be responsible.
     Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes and Guarantees constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, respectively, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantors, respectively, in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
 
     We are members of the bars of the State of New York and the State of California. We do not express any opinion herein on any laws other than the law of the State of New York, the law of the State of California, the Delaware General Corporation Law and applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting these laws, and the federal law of the United States of America.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K. We also hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission.
Very truly yours, /s/ Covington & Burling LLP
