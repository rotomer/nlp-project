Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
     On March 31, 2011, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the "Company") issued shares of its Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined below). So long as any of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding, no dividend, except a dividend payable in shares of the common stock, without par value, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), or other shares ranking junior to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, may be paid or declared or any distribution be made on shares of the Common Stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the then outstanding Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock payable on all dividend payment dates occurring on or prior to the date of such action have been declared and paid or funds sufficient therefor set apart. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Common Stock with respect to distribution rights in the event of any liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.
     On March 30, 2011, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio a Certificate of Amendment (the "Certificate of Amendment") to the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the "Amended Articles of Incorporation"). The Certificate of Amendment, which was effective on the date it was filed, designated 10,000,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock, without par value, as "5.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock" (the "Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock").
     Quarterly dividends on each share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will accrue at a rate of 5.875% per year on the initial liquidation preference of $50.00 per share. Dividends will accrue and accumulate from the date of issuance and, to the extent that the Company is legally permitted to pay a dividend and the Company's board of directors declares a dividend payable, the Company will pay dividends in cash on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on July 1, 2011 and ending on April 1, 2014. Each share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $50.00, plus an amount equal to the sum of all accrued and unpaid dividends.
     Unless converted earlier, each share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert on April 1, 2014 into between 2.7454 and 3.4317 shares of Common Stock, depending on the market value of the Common Stock on that date, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. At any time prior to April 1, 2014, holders may elect to convert shares of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at the minimum conversion rate of 2.7454 shares of Common Stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. If certain fundamental changes involving the Company occur, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may convert their shares into a number of shares of Common Stock at the fundamental change conversion rate described in the Certificate of Amendment. If the Company at any time has not paid the equivalent of six full quarterly dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company may, at its option, cause all, but not less than all, outstanding shares of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into a number of shares of the Common Stock based on the fundamental change conversion rate.
 
Upon conversion, the Company will pay converting holders all accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not previously declared, on the converted shares and, in the case of a conversion upon a fundamental change or a conversion following nonpayment of dividends, the present value of the remaining dividend payments on the converted shares. Except as required by law or as specifically set forth in the Amended Articles of Incorporation, the holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will have no voting rights. The Company has applied to list the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "GTPrA."
     A copy of the Certificate of Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1. This description of the Certificate of Amendment and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit and to the Amended Articles of Incorporation.

     2. 
Purchase, Sale and Delivery of the Firm Shares.
          (a) On the basis of the representations, warranties and covenants herein contained, and subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to the Underwriters and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase, the respective number of Firm Shares set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule I hereto at a price equal to $48.50 per share, subject to adjustments in accordance with Section 10 hereof.
          (b) Payment for the Firm Shares to be sold hereunder is to be made in Federal (same day) funds against delivery thereof to the Representatives for the several accounts of the Underwriters. Such payment and delivery are to be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the third business day
 
after the date of this Agreement or at such other time and date not later than five business days thereafter as you and the Company shall agree upon, such time and date being herein referred to as the "Closing Date." (As used herein, "business day" means a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which banks in New York are open for business and are not permitted by law or executive order to be closed.)
          (c) In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase the Option Shares at the price per share as set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 2. The option granted hereby may be exercised in whole or in part by giving written notice (i) at any time before the Closing Date and (ii) at any time, from time to time (but no more than twice without the Company's consent) thereafter within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, by you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, to the Company setting forth the number of Option Shares as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and the time and date at which such Option Shares are to be delivered. The time and date at which Option Shares are to be delivered shall be determined by the Representatives but shall not be earlier than three nor later than 10 full business days after the exercise of such option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Date (each such time and date being herein referred to as an "Option Closing Date"). If the date of exercise of the option is three or more days before the Closing Date, the notice of exercise shall set the Closing Date as the Option Closing Date. The number of Option Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be in the same proportion to the total number of Option Shares being purchased as the number of Firm Shares being purchased by such Underwriter bears to the total number of Firm Shares, adjusted by you in such manner as to avoid fractional shares. The option with respect to the Option Shares granted hereunder may be exercised in connection with the sale of the Firm Shares by the Underwriters. You, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, may cancel such option at any time prior to its expiration by giving written notice of such cancellation to the Company. To the extent that the option is exercised, payment for the Option Shares shall be made on each Option Closing Date in Federal (same day) funds through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company in New York, New York drawn to the order of the Company.
     3. 
Offering by the Underwriters.
     It is understood that the several Underwriters are to make a public offering of the Firm Shares as soon as the Representatives deem it advisable to do so. The Firm Shares are to be initially offered to the public at the initial public offering price set forth in the Prospectus. The Representatives may from time to time thereafter change the public offering price and other selling terms.
     Any action by the Underwriters hereunder may be taken by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, and any such action taken by the Representatives shall be binding upon the Underwriters.
     4. 
Covenants of the Company.
     The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that:
 
          (a) The Company will (i) prepare and timely file with the Commission under Rule 424(b) (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)) under the Act the Prospectus in a form approved by the Representatives containing information previously omitted at the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement in reliance on Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Act, (ii) during the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined below), not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or distribute an amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any document incorporated by reference therein of which the Representatives shall not previously have been advised and furnished with a copy or to which the Representatives shall have reasonably objected in writing or which is not in compliance with the Rules and Regulations and (iii) file on a timely basis all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and during the Prospectus Delivery Period.
          (b) The Company will (i) not make any offer relating to the Preferred Shares that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission under Rule 433 under the Act unless the Representatives approve its use in writing prior to first use (each, a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus"); provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus(es) included in Schedule III hereto, (ii) treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, (iii) comply with the requirements of Rules 163, 164 and 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including the requirements relating to timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping and (iv) not take any action that would result in an Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that such Underwriter otherwise would not have been required to file thereunder.
          (c) The Company will advise the Representatives promptly (i) when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement relating to the Shares shall have become effective, or any supplement to the Prospectus shall have been filed, (ii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission relating to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, (iii) of any request of the Commission for amendment of the Registration Statement or the filing of a new registration statement relating to the Shares or any amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or for any additional information relating to the Shares, and (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or such new registration statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or of the institution of any proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order and to obtain as soon as possible the lifting thereof, if issued.
          (d) If at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective
 
amendment on the proper form relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable (if such filing is not otherwise effective immediately pursuant to Rule 462 under the Act), and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Preferred Shares to continue as contemplated in the Registration Statement that was the subject of the notice under Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement relating to the Shares shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
          (e) The Company agrees to pay the required filing fees to the Commission relating to the Shares within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Act (including, if applicable, by updating the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii), either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act).
          (f) The Company will promptly from time to time take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify the Shares for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the offering and resale of the Shares, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required (i) to qualify as a foreign corporation, (ii) to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or (iii) to take any action that would subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction if it is not otherwise so subject.
          (g) The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Representatives, from time to time, as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Representatives, from time to time, as many copies of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as the Representatives may reasonably request.

The Company will deliver to the Representatives at or before the Closing Date, such number of copies of the Registration Statement (including such number of copies of the exhibits filed therewith that may reasonably be requested), including documents incorporated by reference therein, and of all amendments thereto, as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          (h) The Company will comply with the Act and the Rules and Regulations, and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Preferred Shares as contemplated in this Agreement and the Prospectus. If during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event shall occur as a result of
 
which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or, if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (i) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or (ii) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with the law.
          (i) If the General Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Preferred Shares at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or to make the statements therein not conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (i) prepare, file with the Commission (if required) and furnish to the Underwriters and any dealers an appropriate amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or (ii) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the General Disclosure Package so that the General Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or conflict with the Registration Statement then on file, or so that the General Disclosure Package will comply with law.
          (j) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as it is practicable to do so, but in any event not later than 16 months after the effective date of the Registration Statement, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) in reasonable detail, covering a period of at least 12 consecutive months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
          (k) No offering, sale, short sale or other disposition of any shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock (other than any Underlying Common Shares issued upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares) or a derivative of Preferred Stock or Common Stock (or agreement for such) will be made for a period of 90 days after the date of the Prospectus, directly or indirectly, by the Company otherwise than hereunder or with the prior written consent of the Representatives; provided, however, that the Company may file a registration statement on Form S-8 and may issue shares of its Common Stock and options to purchase shares of its Common Stock (including, but not limited to, "reload" options) pursuant to any stock option, stock bonus, employment agreement, employee benefit plan or other stock plan or arrangement, in each case in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
 
          (l) The Company has caused each person listed on Schedule V hereto to furnish to you, on or prior to the date of this Agreement, a letter or letters, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each such agreement, a "Lockup Agreement").
          (m) The Company shall apply the net proceeds of its sale of the Preferred Shares as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
          (n) The Company shall not be or become, at any time prior to the expiration of two years after the Closing Time, an open-end investment company, unit investment trust, closed-end investment company or face-amount certificate company that is or is required to be registered under Section 8 of the 1940 Act.
          (o) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that could reasonably be expected to cause or result in any stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Shares.
          (p) The Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, such number of Underlying Common Shares as is necessary to enable the Company to satisfy any obligations to issue Underlying Common Shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares in accordance with the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation and the Certificate of Amendment.
          (q) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company will not do or authorize any act or thing that would result in an adjustment of the conversion price of the Preferred Shares.
          (r) The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Shares to be duly listed on the New York Stock Exchange as promptly as practicable.
     5.  Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that:
Covenant of the Underwriters.
     It has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any "free writing prospectus", as defined in Rule 405 under the Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) a free writing prospectus that, solely as a result of use by such Underwriter, would not trigger an obligation to file such free writing prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule III or prepared pursuant to Section 4(b) above (including any electronic road show), or (iii) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing.

any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter, such affiliate or any such controlling person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 14 herein; and
     (2) to reimburse each Underwriter, each Underwriter's directors and officers, each affiliate of any Underwriter and each such controlling person upon demand for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter, such affiliate or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding or in responding to a subpoena or governmental inquiry related to the offering of the Preferred Shares, whether or not such Underwriter or controlling person is a party to any action or proceeding. In the event that it is finally judicially determined that the Underwriters were not entitled to receive payments for legal and other expenses pursuant to this subparagraph, the Underwriters will promptly return all sums that had been advanced pursuant hereto. This indemnity agreement in this Section 9(a) will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
          (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary
 
Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 14 herein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have.
          (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 9, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing. No indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or (b) shall be available to any party who shall fail to give notice as provided in this Section 9(c) if the party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, but the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on account of the provisions of Section 9(a) or (b). In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred (or within 30 days of presentation) the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party, reasonably incurred, in the event (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel acceptable to the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time after notice of commencement of the action. Such firm shall be designated in
 
writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(a) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. In addition, the indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 9(a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Preferred Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
 
such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Preferred Shares purchased by such Underwriter and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 9(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
          (e) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 9 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.
          (f) Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section 9 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are incurred. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement. A successor to any Underwriter, its directors or officers or any person controlling any Underwriter, or to the Company, its directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company, shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements contained in this Section 9.
     10. 
Default by Underwriters.
     If on the Closing Date or any Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter shall fail to purchase and pay for the portion of the Preferred Shares which such Underwriter has agreed to purchase and pay for on such date (otherwise than by reason of any default on the part of the Company), you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, shall use your reasonable efforts to procure within 36 hours thereafter one or more of the other Underwriters, or any others, to purchase from the Company such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms set forth herein, the Preferred Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters failed to purchase. If during such 36 hours you, as such Representatives, shall not have procured such other Underwriters, or any others, to purchase the Preferred Shares agreed to be purchased by the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Preferred Shares on such terms. If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of Preferred Shares by a defaulting Underwriter by you and the Company provided above, the aggregate number of Preferred Shares with respect to which such default shall occur does not exceed 10% of the Preferred Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or any such Option Closing date, as the case may be, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in
 
proportion to the respective numbers of Preferred Shares which they are obligated to purchase hereunder, to purchase the Preferred Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters failed to purchase. If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Preferred Shares by a defaulting Underwriter by you and the Company provided above, the aggregate number of Preferred Shares with respect to which such default shall occur exceeds 10% of the Preferred Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or any such Option Closing Date, as the case may be, the Company or you as the Representatives of the Underwriters will have the right, by written notice given within the next 36-hour period to the parties to this Agreement, to terminate this Agreement without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or of the Company except to the extent provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof. In the event of a default by any Underwriter or Underwriters, as set forth in this Section 10, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or any such Option Closing Date, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. The term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
     11. 
Notices.
All communications hereunder shall be in writing and, except as otherwise provided herein, will be mailed, delivered, telecopied or telegraphed and confirmed as follows: if to the Underwriters, to Goldman, Sachs & Co., 200 West Street New York, New York 10282; Attention: Registration Department and J.P.

or crisis (including, without limitation, an act of terrorism) or change in economic or political conditions if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, emergency, calamity, crisis or change on the financial markets of the United States would, in your judgment, materially impair the investment quality of the Preferred Shares, (iii) since the Applicable Time there has been a suspension of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or limitation on prices (other than limitations on hours or numbers of days of trading) for securities on any such Exchange, (iv) since the Applicable Time there has been a declaration of a banking moratorium by United States or New York State authorities, (v) since the Applicable Time (A) there has been any downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by Moody's or S&P, or (B) either Moody's or S&P, or both, have publicly announced that they have under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, their rating of any of the Company's debt securities or (vi) since the Applicable Time there has been the suspension of trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company by the New York Stock Exchange, the Commission, or any other governmental or regulatory authority; or
          (b) as provided in Sections 7 and 10 of this Agreement.
     13. 
Successors.
     This Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors, executors, administrators, heirs and assigns, and the officers, directors and controlling persons referred to herein, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. No purchaser of any of the Preferred Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign merely because of such purchase.
     14. 
Information Provided by Underwriters.
     The Company and the Underwriters acknowledge and agree that the only information furnished or to be furnished by any Underwriter to the Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus consists of the information set forth in the fifth and eighth paragraphs in their entirety and the fifth and sixth sentences of the thirteenth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.

determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect to the matters covered by this paragraph. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
          (c) This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
          (d) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York, including, without limitation, Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law.
          (e) The Underwriters, on the one hand, and the Company (on its own behalf and, to the extent permitted by law, on behalf of its stockholders), on the other hand, waive any right to trial by jury in any action, claim, suit or proceeding with respect to your engagement as underwriter or your role in connection herewith.
          (f) No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor any consent or approval to any departure therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto.

As Representatives of the      Several Underwriters
c/o Goldman, Sachs & Co. 200 West Street New York, New York 10282
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 383 Madison Avenue New York, New York 10179
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     The undersigned understands that Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives (the "Representatives") of the several underwriters (the "Underwriters"), proposes to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the "Company"), providing for the public offering (the "Public Offering") by the Underwriters, including the Representatives, of the Company's mandatory convertible preferred stock, no par value (the "Preferred Stock"), which Preferred Stock shall be convertible into common stock, no par value, of the Company (the "Common Stock").
     To induce the Underwriters that may participate in the Public Offering to continue their efforts in connection with the Public Offering, the undersigned agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, the undersigned will not, directly or indirectly, (1) offer, sell, pledge, contract to sell (including any short sale), grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation, shares of Common Stock which may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned on the date hereof in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon exercise of a stock option or warrant and any other security convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock) or (2) enter into any Hedging
 
Transaction (as defined below) relating to the Common Stock (each of the foregoing referred to as a "Disposition") during the period specified in the following paragraph (the "Lock-Up Period"). The foregoing restriction is expressly intended to preclude the undersigned from engaging in any Hedging Transaction or other transaction which is designed to or is reasonably expected to lead to or result in a Disposition during the Lock-Up Period even if the securities would be disposed of by someone other than the undersigned. "Hedging Transaction" means any short sale (whether or not against the box) or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including, without limitation, any put or call option) with respect to any security (other than a broad-based market basket or index) that includes, relates to or derives any significant part of its value from the Common Stock.
     The initial Lock-Up Period will commence on the date hereof and continue until, and include, the date that is 90 days after the date of the final prospectus relating to the Public Offering (the "Initial Lock-Up Period").
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the undersigned may (a) transfer shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Company's employee stock purchase plans in existence on the date hereof, including, without limitation, any such plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, (b) transfer shares of Common Stock to the Company for the purpose of exercising employee stock options pursuant to the share swap exercise provisions set forth therein, provided that the shares acquired upon the exercise of such options shall be subject to the provisions of this Lock-Up Agreement, and (c) transfer shares of Common Stock or other Company securities if the transfer is by gift, will or intestacy; provided that the transferee executes an agreement stating that the transferee is receiving and holding the securities subject to the provisions of this Lock-Up Agreement.
     The undersigned agrees that the Company may, with respect to any shares of Common Stock or other Company securities for which the undersigned is the beneficial or record holder, cause the transfer agent for the Company to note stop transfer instructions with respect to such securities on the transfer books and records of the Company.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the closing of the Public Offering has not occurred prior to April 16, 2011 or the Underwriting Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 12 thereof, this agreement shall be of no further force or effect.
 
     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full power and authority to enter into this Lock-Up Agreement. All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the death or incapacity of the undersigned and any obligations of the undersigned shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned.

Except as to the financial statements, including the notes and schedules thereto, and other financial and statistical data included in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as to which we express no opinion, the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of its date, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act.

     5. The Underwriting Agreement conforms in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
     6. No consent, approval, authorization or other action by or filing with any governmental agency or instrumentality of the State of New York or the United States of America is required on the part of the Company for the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Preferred Shares, the issuance of shares of common stock of the Company upon conversion of the Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms of the Amended Articles of Incorporation and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, except for (i) those already obtained or made and (ii) any of the foregoing as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
     7. The issuance and sale of the Preferred Shares, the issuance of shares of common stock of the Company upon conversion of the Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms of the Amended Articles of Incorporation, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein

     8. The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Preferred Shares and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     In addition, in accordance with our understanding with the Company as to the scope of our services in connection with the offering of the Preferred Shares, as counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, your counsel and the Company's accountants. On the basis of the information that was reviewed by us in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law and the experience we have gained through our practice under the federal securities laws, we confirm to you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time the Registration Statement became effective under the Act (including the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement at the time it became effective pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package, except as specified in paragraph 4 above. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements, including the notes and schedules thereto, and other financial and statistical data included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package.
 
          1. The Company and the subsidiaries listed on hereto (each, a "" and collectively, the "") are each duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization. The Company has the power and authority to execute and deliver the Underwriting Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby and to perform its obligations thereunder. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has the requisite power and authority to own its respective properties and to conduct the businesses in which it is engaged, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
