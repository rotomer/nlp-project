Item 8.01. Other Events.
On February 23, 2012, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"), for the issuance and sale by the Company of $700 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.000% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Notes"). The Notes are guaranteed by the Company's U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee the Company's obligations under its senior secured credit facilities (the "Subsidiary Guarantors"). The Company registered the offering and sale of the Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-168704) (the "Registration Statement"). A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is attached as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The offering of the Notes is expected to close on February 28, 2012. The Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 13, 2010 (the "Base Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 28, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"). The Indenture provides, among other things, that the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with all of the Company's other senior unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Interest is payable on the Notes on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2012. The Notes will mature on May 15, 2022. On or after May 15, 2017, the Company may redeem for cash some or all of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the Supplemental Indenture. Prior to May 15, 2017, the Company may redeem for cash some or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus the make-whole premium set forth in the Supplemental Indenture. In addition, at any time prior to May 15, 2015, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Supplemental Indenture.
The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, if the Notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moody's and Standard & Poor's and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended.
The Indenture provides for customary events of default that include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or other agreements in the Indenture, defaults in or failure to pay certain other indebtedness or judgments, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all of the
 
Notes to be due and payable. In addition, in the event of a change in control, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
A copy of the Base Indenture was originally filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 13, 2010. A copy of the Supplemental Indenture is attached as Exhibit 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The descriptions of the material terms of the Indenture and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibits.
A news release dated February 24, 2012 announcing the pricing of the offering of the Notes is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

(i) If the General Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or to make the statements therein not conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either

(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing. No indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or (b) shall be available to any party who shall fail to give notice as provided in this Section 8(c) if the party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, but the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on account of the provisions of Section 8(a) or (b). In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred (or within 30 days of presentation) the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party, reasonably incurred, in the event (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel acceptable to the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time after notice of commencement of the action. Such firm shall be designated in writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. In addition, the indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 8 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join
 
it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.
(f) Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section 8 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are incurred. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement. A successor to any Underwriter, its directors or officers or any person controlling any Underwriter, or to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, its or their directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements contained in this Section 8.

EFAULT
BY
NDERWRITERS
If on the Closing Date any Underwriter shall fail to purchase and pay for the portion of the Securities which such Underwriter has agreed to purchase and pay for on such date (otherwise than by reason of any default on the part of the Company), you, as Representative of the Underwriters, shall use your reasonable efforts to procure within 36 hours thereafter one or more of the other Underwriters, or any others, to purchase from the Company such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms set forth herein, the principal amount of the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters failed to purchase. If during such 36 hours you, as such Representative, shall not have procured such other Underwriters, or any others, to purchase the principal amount of the Securities agreed to be purchased by the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or parties satisfactory to you to purchase such principal amount of the Securities on such terms. If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of Securities by a defaulting Underwriter by you and the Company provided above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default shall occur does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities which they are obligated to purchase hereunder, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters failed to purchase. If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities by a defaulting Underwriter by you and the Company provided above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default shall occur exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date, the Company or you as the Representative of the Underwriters will have the right, by written notice given within the next 36-hour period to the parties to this Agreement, to terminate this Agreement without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or of the Company except to the extent provided in Sections 5 and 8 hereof. In the event of a default by any Underwriter or Underwriters, as set forth in this Section 9, the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. The term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter.
 
Any action taken under this Section 9 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

Each of the Goodyear Companies is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

(1) the assumption of Indebtedness or other obligations of the Company (other than obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock of the Company) or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or obligations in connection with such Asset Disposition;
(2) any Designated Non-cash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, does not exceed at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with
 
the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of (1) $200,000,000 and (2) 1.5% of the total Consolidated assets of the Company as shown on the most recent balance sheet of the Company filed with the SEC;
(3) securities, notes or similar obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are promptly converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash; and
(4) Temporary Cash Investments.
(c) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes pursuant to Section 4.06(a)(3)(C), the Company shall be required (i) to purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Notes (the "Offer") at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription), set forth in Section 4.06(d) and (ii) to purchase other Senior Indebtedness of the Company on the terms and to the extent contemplated thereby; that in no event shall the Company offer to purchase such Senior Indebtedness of the Company at a purchase price in excess of 100% of its principal amount (without premium) or, unless otherwise provided for in such Senior Indebtedness, the accreted amount, if issued with original issue discount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. If the aggregate purchase price of Notes (and Senior Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to the Offer is less than the Net Available Cash allotted to the purchase of the Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness), the Company shall apply the remaining Net Available Cash in accordance with Section 4.06(a)(3)(D). The Company shall not be required to make an Offer for Notes (and Senior Indebtedness) pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in Section 4.06(a)(3)(A) and Section 4.06(a)(3)(B)) is less than $25,000,000 for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amount will be carried forward for purposes of determining whether an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition).
provided
(d) (1) If the aggregate purchase price of Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness) tendered pursuant to the Offer exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company shall select the Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness) to be purchased on a pro rata basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that only Notes and other Senior Indebtedness in denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall be purchased).
(2) Promptly, and in any event within 10 days after the Company becomes obligated to make an Offer, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by first-class mail to each Holder, a written notice stating that the Holder may elect to have his Notes purchased by the Company either in whole or in part (subject to prorating as described in Section 4.06(d)(1) in the event the Offer is
 
oversubscribed) in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount at the applicable purchase price. The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date").
(3) Not later than the date upon which written notice of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided below, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as to (A) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), including information as to any other Senior Indebtedness included in the Offer for repurchase, (B) the allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Dispositions pursuant to which such Offer is being made and (C) the compliance of such allocation with the provisions of Section 4.06(a) and (c).

If the Offer includes other Senior Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made with any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the Notes delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the Notes, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period for application in accordance with this Section 4.06.
(4) Holders electing to have a Note purchased shall be required to surrender the Note, with an appropriate form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date. A Holder shall be entitled to withdraw its election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the Purchase Date, a telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of the Note which was delivered for purchase by such Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Note purchased. Holders whose Notes are purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered.
(5) At the time the Company delivers Notes to the Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company shall also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.06. A Note shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time the Trustee, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers payment therefor to the surrendering Holder.
 
(e) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes pursuant to this Section 4.06.

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be paid pursuant to Section 4.04,

(7) the issuance or sale of any Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company,
(8) any agreement as in effect on the Closing Date and described in the Prospectus or in the Company's SEC filings as filed on or prior to the Closing Date, or any renewals, extensions or amendments of any such agreement (so long as such renewals, extensions or amendments are not less favorable in any material respect to the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries) and the transactions evidenced thereby,

(b) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee (the "Change of Control Offer"), stating:

In addition, the Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if the Notes have been called for redemption to the extent that the Company mails a valid notice of redemption to Holders prior to the Change of Control, and thereafter redeems all Notes called for redemption in accordance with the terms set forth in such redemption notice.

Limitation on Liens
 
Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding sentence shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

Each Subsidiary Guarantee shall be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be Guaranteed by that Subsidiary Guarantor without rendering the Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
Future Subsidiary Guarantors
SECTION 4.12. . (a) Following the first day (the "Suspension Date") that:
Suspension of Certain Covenants
 
 
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.11 and Section 5.01(a)(3)(collectively, the "Suspended Covenants"). In addition, the Company may elect to suspend the Subsidiary Guarantees.
(b) In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the foregoing and on any subsequent date (the "Reversion Date") one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to such Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events and the Subsidiary Guarantees shall be reinstated. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to herein as the "Suspension Period."
(c) Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period. During any Suspension Period, the Company shall not designate any Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary unless the Company would have been permitted to designate such Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if a Suspension Period had not been in effect for any period.
(d) On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period shall be classified to have been Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03(to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or Section 4.03(b), such Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been outstanding on the Closing Date, so that it is classified as permitted under Section 4.03(b)(3)(B). Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under Section 4.04 shall be made as though Section 4.04 had been in effect since the Closing Date and throughout the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period shall reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under Section 4.04(a) and the items specified in Section 4.04(a)(3) shall increase the amount available to be made under Section 4.04(a). For purposes of determining compliance with Section 4.06(a) and Section 4.06(b), the Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions not applied in accordance with Section 4.06 shall be deemed to be reset to zero after the Reversion Date.
(e) In addition, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may honor any contractual commitments to take actions after a Reversion Date as long as such contractual commitments were entered into during a Suspension Period and not in anticipation of such Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies.
 
(f) The Company shall provide written notice to the Trustee of the occurrence of any Suspension Date or Reversion Date and of any election made pursuant to this Section; the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 4.12 or the Company's rights hereunder.
provided that
SECTION 4.13. . The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company a certificate signed by a Financial Officer complying with TIA  314(a)(4) stating (i) that a review of the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the preceding fiscal year has been made with a view to determining whether the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors have fulfilled their obligations under this Supplemental Indenture and (ii) that, to the knowledge of such Financial Officer, no Default or Event of Default occurred during such period (or, if a Default or Event of Default hereunder shall have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default hereunder of which such Financial Officer may have knowledge and what action the Company has taken, is taking and/or proposes to take with respect thereto).

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and
(3) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with this Supplemental Indenture.

(6) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary fails to pay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $100,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent;

When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.
Waiver of Past Defaults
 
SECTION 6.05. . The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Supplemental Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, unless the Trustee's duty to resign is stayed as provided in TIA Section 310(b), any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
SECTION 7.09. . If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.
Successor Trustee by Merger
In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Supplemental Indenture any of the Notes shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such Notes so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Notes shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Notes either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Notes or in this Supplemental Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
SECTION 7.10. . The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA  310(a). The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA  310(b); , , that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA  310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA  310(b)(1) are met.
Eligibility; Disqualification
provided
however
SECTION 7.11. . The Trustee shall comply with TIA  311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA  311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA  311(a) to the extent indicated.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company
SECTION 8.01. . (a) When (1) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Notes (other than Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.07) for cancellation or (2) all outstanding Notes have become due and payable, whether at maturity or on a redemption date as a result of the mailing of a notice of redemption pursuant to Article 3 hereof and, in the case of clause (2), the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee funds or U.S. Government Obligations (or any combination thereof) sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Notes, including premium, if any, and interest thereon to maturity or such redemption date (other than Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.07), and if in either case

The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(5) (with respect only to the Company's obligations under Section 4.02), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(a)(3). In the event that the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee.
Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel complying with Section 11.04, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent accountants
 
expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Notes to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Trustee or any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of this Supplemental Indenture or otherwise; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Supplemental Indenture or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Subsidiary Guarantor under this Agreement; (iii) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor; or (iv) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor).

The Trustee may, at its election, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor have been fully and indefeasibly paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Subsidiary Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Subsidiary Guarantor against the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be.
 
(e) Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, any other Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise.
SECTION 10.02. .

AKRON, Ohio, February 24, 2012 - The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company today announced that it has priced its offering of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year senior notes. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company. They will be sold at 100% of the principal amount and will bear interest at a rate of 7.0%. Goodyear expects the offering to close on February 28, 2012, subject to customary closing conditions.
Goodyear intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with current cash and cash equivalents, to redeem all of its $650 million in aggregate principal amount of its 10.5% senior notes due 2016.
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as the joint book-running managers for the offering.
The offering was made under a shelf registration statement that was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and became automatically effective on August 10, 2010. The offering of the notes may be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, copies of which may be obtained from:
