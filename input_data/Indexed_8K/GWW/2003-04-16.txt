        CHICAGO, April 16, 2003  Grainger (NYSE: GWW) today reported first quarter earnings per share of 57 cents, a 58 percent increase over 36 cents in the first quarter of 2002. Sales in the 2003 first quarter were $1,139 million, up 1 percent, versus $1,125 million in the prior year's first quarter. Net earnings of $52 million versus $35 million were up 52 percent. The first quarter 2002 included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $24 million or 25 cents per share.
        Richard L. Keyser, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am pleased we were able to grow sales and maintain margins in a difficult economy. We continue to position for future growth by investing in service enhancements to extend Grainger's competitive advantage in the facilities maintenance industry. Construction of our redesigned logistics network remains on schedule, with all distribution centers expected to be up and running by early next year."
        Keyser added, "We are facing an uncertain economy, which shows few signs of improvement. Based on softer than expected sales in the first quarter and our limited visibility to a recovery, the company now forecasts sales growth of 4 to 6 percent and earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.65 for 2003. This guidance is within our original range provided in December 2002, but reflects our caution regarding the current economic environment."

        Sales in the Branch-based Distribution segment increased by 2 percent in the 2003 first quarter. The segment benefited from improvements in Canada. This improvement was partially offset by flat sales in Mexico, as the economy there remains weak. Continuing softness in the U.S. economy also affected domestic sales, which were up 1 percent in the quarter. While sales were generally softer, the company reported an 11 percent increase in sales to government customers and a 4 percent increase to national accounts. Daily sales through grainger.com increased 21 percent to $115 million versus the 2002 first quarter. Operating earnings for the Branch-based Distribution segment were up 2 percent versus the 2002 first quarter.
         Lab Safety, the premier direct marketer of safety and industrial products, experienced a 2 percent decline in sales. This business participates heavily in the manufacturing sector, and its performance reflects ongoing weakness in that sector in the United States. Operating earnings for this unit were down 16 percent, due in large part to higher catalog media and health care-related expenses.
        Integrated Supply's sales were flat versus 2002 as a result of disengagements from several customers. Operating earnings for this segment were $1.1 million as compared to $1.6 million in the 2002 first quarter, down 28 percent, due to lower fee income.
        Other Income and Expense swung from a net $8.8 million of income in the first quarter of 2002 to a net $3.4 million of expense in 2003. The 2003 first quarter included a before tax write-down of $1.6 million, to recognize the decline in value of an investment security; the 2002 first quarter included $7.3 million in before tax non-operating gains from the sale of investment securities. The impact in earnings per share for the write-down in the first quarter of 2003 was 1 cent of expense versus 4 cents of income from the gains on sale of securities in 2002.
         The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased due to lower non-deductible losses in Mexico and a reduced tax rate in Canada. Operating cash flow of $50 million for the quarter was primarily used to invest in the business, which included capital projects, such as the logistics network, and to pay dividends.

The Company's operating earnings of $91 million increased 2% for the first quarter of 2003 as compared with $90 million for the same 2002 period. The Branch-based Distribution segment reported improved operating earnings versus the 2002 quarter, while Lab Safety and Integrated Supply reported lower operating earnings. Also contributing to the improvement was a reduction in headquarters expenses.
The change in ROIC was primarily attributable to inventory infusion and capital expenditures, partially offset by a reduction in receivables.
For the 2003 first quarter, "Other Income and Expense" was a net $3.4 million of expense versus a net $8.8 million of income for the 2002 quarter. This difference is primarily driven by a write-down of investment securities in 2003 of $1.6 million versus a $7.3 million gain on sale of investment securities in 2002. In addition, in 2002 there was a $2.8 million gain on the sale of a facility.
The Company's effective income tax rate was 40.5% for the first quarter of 2003 and 40.8% for the 2002 first quarter. Excluding the effect of equity losses in unconsolidated entities, which are recorded net of tax, the effective income tax rate was 40.0% for 2003 and 40.5% for 2002. This change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower non-deductible losses in Mexico and a lower tax rate in Canada.

 Sales for this segment increased 2% for the quarter.
Net Sales
Sales in the United States were up 1% versus 2002, primarily driven by sales to government accounts, up 11%, and national accounts, up 4%. Sales through the grainger.com web site were $115 million, a 21% increase versus first quarter 2002 sales of $95 million.
Sales in Canada increased 11% for the quarter versus 2002 including the effect of a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, this business experienced a 5% increase due to higher sales to the government and increased sales to the petroleum industry.
Sales in Mexico were flat for the quarter versus 2002. This reflects the continuing softness of the Mexico economy.
 
BRANCH-BASED DISTRIBUTION (continued)                       -------------------------------------
 Operating earnings increased 2% for the 2003 first quarter as compared with the 2002 period. This operating performance reflects improved results in Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. was down 1%.
Operating Earnings
The gross profit margin increased 0.71 percentage point from the comparable 2002 quarter. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to selected pricing actions intended to recover freight and supplier cost increases, and to favorable product mix. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher freight costs related to the logistics project and increased fuel costs.
Operating expenses were up 4% for the quarter, primarily the result of incremental costs related to the logistics project and increases in other payroll and benefits costs including increased health care costs.

 Sales decreased 2% for the quarter for Lab Safety, the Company's direct marketing business. The continuing weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy contributed to this decrease.
Net Sales
 The 16% operating earnings decrease was the result of lower sales, lower gross profit margins and higher operating expenses. Gross profit margins were affected by higher freight costs and product mix. The operating expense increase was primarily due to increased health care costs and increases in distribution of catalog media.

Net Sales
 The operating earnings decrease was due to lower gross profit margins, the result of lower fee revenue. Operating expenses were down slightly but not enough to offset the decline in fees.
