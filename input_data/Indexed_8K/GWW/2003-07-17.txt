Dated: July 17, 2003

CHICAGO, July 17, 2003  Grainger (NYSE: GWW) today reported lower sales but higher earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003. Net earnings were $56.0 million, an increase of 3 percent versus the prior year, and earnings per share were $0.60, up 5 percent compared to $0.57. The 2002 quarter included a $5.8 million expense, or $0.04 per share, related to severance and other costs. Sales in the 2003 second quarter were $1,173 million, down 2 percent, versus $1,195 million for the prior year.
        Richard L. Keyser, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "Despite the effect of a difficult economy, we reported improved earnings. We remain committed to improving service to our customers as they continue to look for ways to reduce costs. Enhancements to our logistics network and local availability of the right products will provide higher levels of service. Our initiatives should accelerate sales growth as more customers experience this improved service."
        During the quarter, the company opened two additional distribution centers in Memphis, Tennessee, and Kansas City, Missouri, representing the fifth and sixth centers in its redesigned logistics network, a key strategic initiative. When the final center is completed by April 2004, the new network will comprise nine distribution centers adding one million square feet of capacity, upgraded automation, $100 million less inventory and a 50 percent improvement in productivity. As forecasted by the company last December, the project is expected to lower operating earnings by $15 million in 2003 but contribute $10 million in 2004 and $20 million in 2005.

        As part of the roll out of the logistics project, the company incurred incremental costs in the quarter associated with the start up of the distribution centers and headcount reductions at several locations. The company also realized a gain of $2.6 million on the sale of a distribution center in Carol Stream, Illinois, whose operations combined with Grainger's Chicago distribution center last year.
Branch-based Distribution
        Sales in the Branch-based Distribution segment decreased by 2 percent in the 2003 second quarter. The weak economy in the United States and Mexico contributed to sales declines of 4 and 6 percent, respectively. In contrast, sales grew 18 percent in Canada aided by currency translation and incremental sales of safety products for SARS in Ontario. Unseasonably cool weather in certain parts of the United States resulted in a 19 percent decline in the sales of seasonal products. Other results included 7 percent growth in sales to government customers and an 8 percent increase in sales processed through grainger.com. Sales through this Web site in the 2003 quarter were $115 million versus the $106 million in the 2002 second quarter. Although gross profit margins increased, operating earnings for the Branch-based Distribution segment declined 6 percent versus the 2002 second quarter, due to lower sales volume, and an increase in operating expenses reflecting incremental expenses for the logistics network and higher health care costs.
Lab Safety
        Lab Safety, the country's premier direct marketer of safety and industrial products, posted a 7 percent increase in sales. Excluding revenues from the Gempler's business acquired on April 14, 2003, sales were down 2 percent. These results reflect ongoing weakness in the manufacturing sector, which represents approximately half of Lab Safety's sales. Operating earnings for this unit were down 8 percent, due primarily to higher catalog media costs and one-time expenses to complete the successful integration of the Gempler's business.
Integrated Supply
        Sales for Integrated Supply were down 10 percent versus the 2002 quarter, the result of fewer engagements at customer locations and the weaker economy. Operating earnings for this segment were $0.8 million as compared to $1.3 million in the 2002 second quarter, due to lower fee revenue and higher operating expenses. 
W.W.   Grainger, Inc.  2003 second quarter results Page 3 of 4
Operating expenses increased due to higher data processing costs associated with a systems upgrade, higher marketing and development expenses, and start up costs at two of six new customer sites.
Tax Rate and Cash Flow
        The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 40.3 percent from 40.7 percent due to lower non-deductible losses in Mexico and a reduced tax rate in Canada. Operating cash flow of $45 million for the quarter was used for capital expenditures and the acquisition of Gempler's, to repurchase 462,700 shares of common stock and to pay dividends.
Six Months Results
        Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $2,312 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Net earnings increased 22 percent to $108.4 million versus $89.0 million in 2002, while earnings per share increased 26 percent to $1.17 from $0.93. In the 2002 period, the company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to its Canadian subsidiary under SFAS 142. The net after-tax charge of $23.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, was effective as of the first quarter of 2002. Net earnings, before the 2002 cumulative effect of the change in accounting for goodwill, decreased 4 percent and earnings per share were down 1 percent versus the 2002 period.
        Last month, the company lowered its 2003 sales expectations to 1 to 3 percent and, given this range of anticipated sales growth, refined its 2003 earnings per share guidance to the lower end of its range of $2.50 to $2.65.

Sales in the second quarter of 2003 were down 2% primarily related to the continued weakness in the U.S. economy and lower sales of seasonal products due to cooler than normal weather. Partially offsetting this were increased sales at Lab Safety as a result of the Gempler's acquisition.

The Company's operating earnings of $93 million decreased 2% for the second quarter of 2003 as compared with $94 million for the same 2002 period. All segments reported lower operating earnings versus the 2002 quarter. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in headquarters' expenses.
The change in ROIC was primarily attributable to increased inventory and to capital expenditures, partially offset by a reduction in receivables.
For the 2003 second quarter, "Other Income and Expense" was a net $1.1 million of income versus a net $2.3 million of expense for the 2002 quarter. The 2003 second quarter included $2.8 million of gains related to the sale of two facilities.
The Company's effective income tax rate was 40.3% for the second quarter of 2003 and 40.7% for the 2002 second quarter. Excluding the effect of equity losses in unconsolidated entities, which are recorded net of tax, the effective income tax rate was 40.0% for 2003 and 40.5% for 2002. This change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower non-deductible losses in Mexico and a lower tax rate in Canada.

 Sales for this segment decreased 2% for the quarter.
Net Sales
Sales in the United States were down 4% versus 2002. Unseasonably cool weather in certain parts of the United States resulted in a 19 percent decline in the sales of seasonal products. All customer segments were down except for government accounts, which were up 7%. National accounts were down 1% for the quarter. Sales through the grainger.com web site were $115 million, an 8% increase versus second quarter 2002 sales of $106 million.
Sales in Canada increased 18% for the quarter versus 2002 including the effect of a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, this business experienced a 6% increase due to higher sales related to the SARS outbreak in Ontario and higher sales to national accounts.
Sales in Mexico were down 6% for the quarter versus 2002. This reflects the continuing softness of Mexico's economy.
*See footnote, page 8.
 Operating earnings decreased 6% for the 2003 second quarter as compared with the 2002 period, primarily the result of lower sales volume. The United States was down 12%, while Canada and Mexico reflected improved operating performance.
Operating Earnings
The gross profit margin increased 1.0 percentage point from the comparable 2002 quarter. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to selected pricing actions intended to recover freight and supplier cost increases, certain one-time benefits relating to line reviews completed in the second quarter, and to favorable product mix. The favorable change in product mix was partially the result of lower sales of seasonal products, which have lower than average gross profit margins. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher freight costs related to both the logistics project and increased fuel costs.
Operating expenses were up 3% for the quarter, primarily the result of incremental costs related to the logistics project and increases in other payroll and benefits costs including increased health care costs.

 Sales increased 7% for the quarter for Lab Safety, the Company's direct marketing business. The increase in sales is attributable to the acquisition of Gempler's on April 14. Excluding this acquisition, sales decreased 2%. The continuing weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy contributed to this decrease.
Net Sales
 The 8% operating earnings decrease was the result of lower gross profit margins and higher operating expenses. Gross profit margins were affected by higher freight costs and an unfavorable product mix. The operating expense increase was primarily due to increases in distribution of catalog media and integration costs associated with the Gempler's acquisition.

 Sales were down 10% for the quarter due to fewer customer locations and the weak economy. Sales for this business unit include product sales and management fees.
Net Sales
 The operating earnings decrease was due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses.  Operating expenses increased due to higher data processing expenses associated with a systems upgrade, higher marketing and development expenses, and start-up costs at two of the six new customer sites.
