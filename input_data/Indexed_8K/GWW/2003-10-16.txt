On October 16, 2003, the registrant issued to interested parties supplemental financial information for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. A copy is provided as Exhibit 99.2 to this report.
             Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: October 16, 2003

                CHICAGO, October 16, 2003  Grainger (NYSE: GWW) today reported flat sales and a 3 percent decline in diluted earnings per share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003. Sales were $1.2 billion in both the 2003 and 2002 third quarters. Net earnings of $56.8 million decreased 5 percent and diluted earnings per share were $0.62 versus $0.64 for the 2002 third quarter.
        Grainger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard L. Keyser said, "We are committed to returning the company to sustained revenue growth. The completion of our logistics network in early 2004 will provide a solid foundation to improve service to our customers. We recently announced a multi-year program to expand our presence in the United States by enhancing our branch network and increasing sales coverage in 25 major metropolitan markets and selected secondary markets. I expect to see accelerated sales growth in the future as this program unfolds."
        Keyser continued, "We now expect sales for the full year to be essentially flat since revenues are not developing as expected. Additionally, we are reducing our 2003 earnings per share range to $2.43 to $2.51 due to lower revenues and implementation expenses related to our branch expansion and ongoing cost control programs."
 
Branch-based Distribution
        Sales in the Branch-based Distribution segment were flat versus the prior year third quarter. The sluggish economy and weak sales of seasonal products contributed to a sales decline of 1 percent in the United States. Overall performance in this segment benefited from incremental spending by government accounts and approximately $2.5 million of sales related to Hurricane Isabel. Sales processed through grainger.com increased 13 percent to $125 million from $110 million in the 2002 third quarter.

Sales in Canada were up 9 percent for the quarter due to the effect of a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, this business experienced a 4 percent sales decrease. Operating earnings for this segment declined 1 percent versus the 2002 third quarter. Increased operating expenses related to the logistics network project and higher health care costs contributed to the decline in earnings.
        As a result of a required accounting reclassification both gross profit and operating expenses increased by the same amount; therefore, there was no effect on operating earnings (see note on EITF Issue 02-16 on page 3).
Lab Safety
        Sales for Lab Safety Supply, the country's premier direct marketer of safety and industrial products, increased 6 percent. Excluding revenues from the Gempler's business acquired on April 14, 2003, sales were down 3 percent. These results reflect ongoing weakness in the manufacturing sector, which represents approximately half of Lab Safety's sales. Operating earnings of $11 million for this segment were down 19 percent, due primarily to increases in catalog media expense and integration costs associated with the Gempler's acquisition.
Integrated Supply
        Sales for Grainger Integrated Supply were down 12 percent during the quarter due to fewer customer locations and lower sales to existing customers. Operating earnings for this segment were $0.7 million versus $1.7 million in the 2002 third quarter, due to lower fee revenue and higher operating expenses primarily related to a systems upgrade.
 
Tax Rate and Cash Flow
        The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 40.0 percent from 40.8 percent due to lower non-deductible losses in Mexico, a reduced tax rate in Canada, and lower losses from unconsolidated entities. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $135 million. The company has reduced its capital expenditures forecast for the full year to $105 to $115 million.

Nine Months Results
        Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, were $3.5 billion, flat versus the 2002 period. Net earnings increased 11 percent to $165 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.79 versus $1.57 in the 2002 period. Net earnings for 2002 included a $0.04 per share gain on sale of securities and a $0.25 per share goodwill impairment charge.

Note: Comments Regarding Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor", was issued by the EITF in November 2002 with transition provisions subsequently issued in January 2003. The January 2003 transition rules stated that Issue 02-16 would apply to all agreements entered into or significantly modified after December 31, 2002.
The company's accounting treatment for vendor provided funds is consistent with Issue 02-16, with the exception of vendor funded advertising allowances. Grainger has accounted for these allowances as an offset to advertising expenses. Under Issue 02-16, this method is allowable if the allowances are for specific, identifiable and incremental costs incurred by Grainger in marketing the vendor's products. Grainger provides numerous advertising programs to promote its vendors, including catalogs and other printed media, Internet, NASCAR racing and other direct marketing programs. Most of these programs relate to multiple vendors which makes supporting the specific, identifiable and incremental criteria a burdensome process. Based on the administrative complexity and costs to identify and track reimbursements to the exact advertising expenditure for each vendor, the company elected to treat most vendor advertising allowances as a reduction of cost of goods sold rather than a reduction of operating (advertising) expenses. This change will not have any effect on net earnings.
Since a majority of the 2003 contracts with provisions for advertising allowances were entered into prior to December 31, 2002, the amounts to be reclassified in 2003 will not be material. The initial reclassification of $5.3 million from operating expenses to cost of goods sold occurred in the 2003 third quarter. For the full year 2003, the total reclassification is projected to be $7 to $10 million.
For 2004, as contracts are renewed, vendor allowances will be classified in cost of goods sold rather than in operating expenses. The company will restate prior periods to maintain comparability. The company estimates that when the year 2003 is restated in 2004, this restatement will be $48 to $55 million, in addition to the amounts recognized in 2003.

Sales in the third quarter of 2003 were flat compared to the 2002 quarter primarily due to the weakness in the U.S. economy and lower sales of seasonal products resulting from cooler than normal weather. Partially offsetting this were net incremental sales from Hurricane Isabel and increased sales at Lab Safety as a result of the Gempler's acquisition.

The Company's operating earnings of $94 million decreased 6% for the third quarter of 2003 as compared with $100 million for the same 2002 period. All segments reported lower operating earnings versus the 2002 quarter.
The change in ROIC was primarily attributable to increased inventory and to capital expenditures, partially offset by a reduction in receivables.
For the 2003 third quarter, "Other Income and Expense" was a net $0.4 million of income versus a net $1.1 million of income for the 2002 quarter. The 2003 third quarter included a $1.2 million gain on the sale of an investment security. The 2002 third quarter included $2.2 million of net gains related to sales of facilities.
The Company's effective income tax rate was 40.0% for the third quarter of 2003 and 40.8% for the 2002 third quarter. Excluding the effect of equity losses in unconsolidated entities, which are recorded net of tax, the effective income tax rate was 40.0% for 2003 and 40.5% for 2002. This change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower non-deductible losses in Mexico and a lower tax rate in Canada.

 Sales for this segment were flat for the quarter.
Net Sales
Sales in the United States were down 1% versus 2002. Unseasonably cool weather in certain parts of the United States resulted in a 16% decline in the sales of seasonal products. All customer segments were down except for government, which was up 11%. Partially offsetting the declines was approximately $2.5 million in net incremental sales related to Hurricane Isabel. National account sales were up 3% for the quarter. Sales through the grainger.com web site were $125 million, a 13% increase versus third quarter 2002 sales of $110 million.
Sales in Canada increased 9% for the quarter versus 2002 due to the effect of a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, this business experienced a 4% decrease in sales impacted by ongoing trade disputes involving exports of lumber to the United States, forest fires in British Columbia and the power blackout in August in eastern Canada.
Sales in Mexico were down 10% for the quarter versus 2002. This reflects the continuing softness of Mexico's economy.
*See footnote, page 8.
 Operating earnings decreased for the 2003 third quarter as compared with the 2002 period, primarily the result of higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher gross profits.
Operating Earnings
The gross profit margin increased 1.0 percentage point from the comparable 2002 quarter. This increase included the effect of a $5.3 million reduction in cost of goods sold due to the reclassification of advertising allowances from operating expenses in accordance with the provisions of EITF Issue 02-16 (see note on page 9). The remaining improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to selected pricing actions intended to recover freight and supplier cost increases, and to favorable product mix. The favorable change in product mix was partially the result of lower sales of seasonal products, which have lower than average gross profit margins. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher freight costs related to both the logistics project and increased fuel costs, as well as an unfavorable change in selling price category mix.
Operating expenses were up 4% for the quarter. This includes an increase in operating expense of the $5.3 million reclassification discussed above. The remaining increase is primarily the result of incremental costs related to the logistics project and increases in payroll and benefits costs, including increased health care costs, and higher advertising expenses.

 Sales increased for the quarter for Lab Safety, the Company's direct marketing business. The increase in sales is attributable to the acquisition of Gempler's on April 14, 2003. Excluding this acquisition, sales decreased 3%. The continuing weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy contributed to this decrease.
Net Sales
 The operating earnings decrease was primarily the result of increases in catalog media and increased warehousing costs related to the acquisition of Gempler's partially offset by higher gross profit.

 Sales were down for the quarter due to fewer customer locations and the weak economy. Sales for this business unit include product sales and management fees.
Net Sales
 The operating earnings decrease was primarily due to lower management fees and higher operating expenses associated with a systems upgrade.

Comments Regarding Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor", was issued by the EITF in November 2002 with transition provisions subsequently issued in January 2003.
