CHICAGO, January 29, 2004  Grainger (NYSE: GWW) today reported earnings per diluted share of $2.46 for the year ended December 31, 2003, up 10 percent versus $2.24 in 2002. Sales for 2003 at $4.7 billion were flat versus 2002. Net earnings for the year were $227 million, up 7 percent versus $212 million in 2002. The year 2002 included a goodwill impairment charge of $0.26 per share and $0.04 per share of non-operating gains from the sale of investment securities.
Sales in the 2003 fourth quarter were $1.2 billion, up 3 percent versus the prior year fourth quarter. Net earnings of $62 million were down 1 percent versus $63 million in the 2002 fourth quarter. Earnings per share were $0.67 in both periods.
"It was a solid year from an operations perspective," said Grainger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard L. Keyser. "We opened two new distribution centers, retrofitted three others, generated operating cash flow of $395 million and completed the acquisition of Gempler's." Keyser added, "Looking forward, we are excited about our growth programs that will extend our reach into key markets by investing in bigger, better positioned branches, improved sales force coverage and greater product availability.  We continue to project earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.70 in 2004."

Sales in the Branch-based Distribution segment increased by 3 percent in the 2003 fourth quarter, led by Canada and Mexico, while sales in the United States were essentially flat. A weak U.S. dollar contributed to Canada's 23 percent increase in sales for the quarter. In local currency, this business experienced 3 percent growth. Sales in Mexico were up 2 percent driven by increased telesales and the expansion of two branches in key markets.
Branch-based Distribution
In the United States, 10 percent sales growth to government accounts was offset by continued weakness in other customer segments for both the 2003 fourth quarter and the year. Sales processed through grainger.com increased 15 percent to $124 million from $108 million in 2002. For the full year, Internet sales were $479 million, up 14 percent versus $420 million in 2002.
Operating earnings for the quarter were flat, a result of increased sales offset by higher operating expenses, including approximately $10 million in severance and other costs resulting from the company's ongoing cost reduction efforts. 
Sales for Lab Safety increased 16 percent for the quarter. This growth was attributed to the Gempler's acquisition; excluding Gempler's, Lab Safety was flat.  Strong December sales reflected Gempler's participation as a supplier in a customer loyalty program, Harvest Partners.
Lab Safety Supply
Lab Safety sales to customers in the forestry and environmental markets were up while sales to manufacturing customers were soft. Operating earnings were up 4 percent due to improved gross profits, partially offset by increased catalog media expenses and higher warehousing costs related to Gempler's.
W.W. Grainger, Inc.  2003 fourth quarter/twelve months results Page 3 of 5
Sales for Grainger Integrated Supply were down 3 percent for the quarter due to six site disengagements and lower volumes from existing customers partially offset by incremental sales at seven new customer locations. Operating earnings in the quarter for this segment were $0.5 million versus $1.7 million in the 2002 fourth quarter, the result of lower management fees and a higher provision for bad debts.
Integrated Supply
The 2003 quarter included $1.9 million in expense for the write-down of investments in two Asian joint ventures. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.9 percent in both years.
Other
Inventory for the year declined by $60 million. This decline consisted of approximately $80 million due primarily to efficiencies from the redesigned logistics network, partially offset by a $20 million revaluation from foreign exchange fluctuations.  The company repurchased 918,300 shares of stock, including 443,600 shares in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for 2003 were $80 million as spending for information technology and facility-related projects came in below expectations.
W.W.  Grainger, Inc. (NYSE: GWW), with 2003 sales of $4.7 billion, is the leading broad line supplier of facilities maintenance products serving businesses and institutions throughout North America. Through its network of nearly 600 branches, 17 distribution centers and multiple Web sites, Grainger helps customers save time and money by providing them with the right products to keep their facilities running.

Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor", was issued by the EITF in November 2002 with transition provisions subsequently issued in January 2003. The January 2003 transition rules stated that Issue 02-16 would apply to all agreements entered into or significantly modified after December 31, 2002.
Comments Regarding Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16
The Company's accounting treatment for vendor provided funds is consistent with Issue 02-16, with the exception of vendor funded advertising allowances. Grainger has accounted for these allowances as an offset to advertising expenses. Under Issue 02-16, this method is allowable if the allowances are for specific, identifiable and incremental costs incurred by Grainger in marketing the vendor's products. During 2003, Grainger provided numerous advertising programs to promote its vendors, including catalogs and other printed media, Internet, NASCAR racing and other direct marketing programs. Most of these programs relate to multiple vendors which makes supporting the specific, identifiable and incremental criteria a burdensome process. Based on the administrative complexity and costs to identify and track reimbursements to the exact advertising expenditure for each vendor, the Company elected to treat most vendor advertising allowances as a reduction of cost of goods sold rather than a reduction of operating (advertising) expenses. This change does not have any effect on net earnings.
Since a majority of the 2003 contracts with provisions for advertising allowances were entered into prior to December 31, 2002, the amounts reclassified in 2003 were not material. In the 2003 fourth quarter, $2.6 million was reclassified from operating expenses to cost of goods sold. For the full year 2003, the total reclassification was $7.9 million.
For 2004, as contracts are renewed, vendor allowances will be classified in cost of goods sold rather than in operating expenses. The Company will restate prior periods to maintain comparability. The Company estimates that when the year 2003 is restated in 2004, this restatement will be approximately $60 million, in addition to the amounts recognized in 2003.
This document contains forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. The forward-looking statements relate to the Company's expected future financial results and business plans, strategies and objectives are not historical facts. They are generally identified by qualifiers such as "will extend our reach", "looking forward", "continue to project" or similar expressions. There are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause the Company's results to differ materially from what is projected. The forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's most recent annual report, as well as the Company's Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, containing a discussion of the Company's business and of various factors that may affect it.

Sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 were up 3% compared to the 2002 quarter driven by an increase in the Branch-based Distribution segment and at Lab Safety. The Branch-based Distribution segment benefited from a favorable exchange rate in the Canadian business. Lab Safety benefited from the acquisition of Gempler's.

The Company's operating earnings were $109 million for both fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002. Operating earnings were flat for the Branch-based Distribution segment, higher for Lab Safety and lower for Integrated Supply.
The decrease in ROIC was primarily attributable to increased average inventory and capital expenditures, partially offset by a reduction in receivables.
For the 2003 fourth quarter, "Other Income and Expense" was $4.3 million of expense versus $2.9 million of expense for the 2002 quarter. The 2003 quarter included $1.9 million in expense for the write-down of investments in two Asian joint ventures.
The Company's effective income tax rate was 40.9% for both fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002. Excluding the effect of equity losses in unconsolidated entities and the write-down of these investments, which are recorded net of tax, the effective income tax rate was 40.0% for 2003 and 40.5% for 2002. This change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower non-deductible losses in Mexico and a lower tax rate in Canada.

 Sales for this segment were up 3% for the quarter.
Net Sales
Sales in the United States were flat versus 2002 driven by strong sales to government accounts offset by continued weakness in other customer segments. National account sales were up 4% for the quarter. Sales through the grainger.com web site were $124 million, a 15% increase versus fourth quarter 2002 sales of $108 million.
Sales in Canada increased 23% for the quarter versus 2002 including the effect of a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, this business experienced a 3% increase in sales driven by project work in the Quebec/Atlantic region and increased national account sales.
Sales in Mexico were up 2% for the quarter versus 2002 driven by telesales and the expansion of two branches in key markets.
*See footnote, page 8.
 Operating earnings for the 2003 fourth quarter were flat compared with the 2002 period, the result of higher gross profits offset by higher operating expenses.
Operating Earnings
The gross profit margin was flat versus the comparable 2002 quarter. This included the effect of a $2.6 million reduction in cost of goods sold due to the reclassification of advertising allowances from operating expenses, in accordance with the provisions of EITF Issue 02-16 (see note on page 9). Also contributing to the improvement in gross profit margin were selected pricing actions intended to recover freight and supplier cost increases, and to favorable product mix. These improvements were offset by an unfavorable change in selling price category mix and higher freight costs related to both the logistics project and increased fuel costs.
Operating expenses were up 4% for the quarter. This included an increase in operating expense for the $2.6 million reclassification discussed above and approximately $10 million of severance and other costs resulting from the Company's ongoing cost reduction efforts. Operating expenses also included incremental costs related to the logistics project and higher advertising expenses.

 Sales increased for the quarter for Lab Safety, the Company's direct marketing business. The increase in sales is attributable to the acquisition of Gempler's on April 14, 2003. Excluding this acquisition, sales for the quarter were essentially flat.
Net Sales
 Operating earnings were up 4% for the quarter. Higher gross profits were partially offset by increased catalog media expenses and increased warehousing costs related to the acquisition of Gempler's.

 Sales were down for the quarter primarily due to 6 site disengagements and lower volumes for existing customers, partially offset by incremental sales at 7 new customer locations. Sales for this business unit include product sales and management fees.
Net Sales
 The operating earnings decrease was primarily due to lower management fees and higher operating expenses. The management fee decrease was the result of fewer customer locations. The increase in operating expense was driven by an incremental bad debt provision.

Comments Regarding Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor", was issued by the EITF in November 2002 with transition provisions subsequently issued in January 2003. The January 2003 transition rules stated that Issue 02-16 would apply to all agreements entered into or significantly modified after December 31, 2002. 
The Company's accounting treatment for vendor provided funds is consistent with Issue 02-16, with the exception of vendor funded advertising allowances. Grainger has accounted for these allowances as an offset to advertising expenses. Under Issue 02-16, this method is allowable if the allowances are for specific, identifiable and incremental costs incurred by Grainger in marketing the vendor's products. During 2003, Grainger provided numerous advertising programs to promote its vendors, including catalogs and other printed media, Internet, NASCAR racing and other direct marketing programs.

For 2004, as contracts are renewed, vendor allowances will be classified in cost of goods sold rather than in operating expenses. The Company will restate prior periods to maintain comparability. The Company estimates that when the year 2003 is restated in 2004, this restatement will be approximately $60 million, in addition to the amounts recognized in 2003.
