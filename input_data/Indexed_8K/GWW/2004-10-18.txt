CHICAGO, October 18, 2004  Grainger (NYSE: GWW) today reported a 19 percent increase in earnings per share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004. Earnings per share were 74 cents versus 62 cents in the 2003 third quarter, surpassing the previous record established in the 2004 second quarter. Sales were $1.3 billion, up 8 percent versus the prior year's third quarter. Net earnings were up 19 percent to $68 million, the highest net earnings for any quarter.
"Our results reflect how hard Grainger's employees are working to deliver outstanding service to our customers," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard L. Keyser. "It's this service together with an improved economy that has helped drive our performance. During the quarter, our redesigned logistics network continued to deliver productivity improvements and is on track to contribute $10 million to operating earnings this year."
Keyser added, "Given our strong performance to date, we've raised our 2004 earnings per share guidance from $2.65 to $2.85 to $2.80 to $2.90."

Sales in the Branch-based Distribution segment increased by 9 percent in the 2004 third quarter versus the 2003 quarter. Sales in the United States were up 8 percent, due largely to strong sales in the manufacturing and commercial sectors. Sales to government accounts were flat compared to the 2003 third quarter. Sales in the first three markets under the market expansion program (Atlanta, Denver and Seattle) grew by 14 percent in the quarter. Sales processed through grainger.com increased 28 percent in the quarter to $160 million from $125 million in 2003.
Branch-based Distribution
The quarter also included sales of $12 million related to hurricanes in the Southeast, which added approximately one cent to EPS.
Sales in Mexico were up 20 percent in the quarter versus the 2003 period, driven by a strengthening economy and the expansion of two branches. A stronger Canadian economy fueled by its natural resources industry resulted in a 14 percent increase in sales (8 percent in Canadian currency).
Operating earnings for the quarter were up 12 percent, the result of higher sales and improved gross profit margins. Operating expenses rose 14 percent during the quarter affected by increases in variable compensation, benefits and spending for the company's initiatives. This includes two key technology projects; accelerating the implementation of SAP across the enterprise and upgrading the IT infrastructure in the branches.
Lab Safety Supply's sales for the quarter were up 9 percent, the result of both an increase in the number of customer accounts and better customer penetration. Operating earnings were up 18 percent, the result of most operating expense categories increasing at a slower rate than sales.

Sales were up 2 percent for the quarter for Integrated Supply. Increased sales from 10 new contracts signed since last year's third quarter were partially offset by disengagements of two large customers late in 2003. Operating earnings for Integrated Supply were up 25 percent for the quarter due primarily to lower data processing costs versus the 2003 period.
Integrated Supply
During the quarter, the company benefited from a subsidy under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. This added approximately one cent per share to the results for the quarter.
Other
Operating cash flow was $145 million for the quarter, while capital expenditures were $42 million. For the full year, the company has lowered its capital expenditures projection to $130 to $140 million from $150 to $175 million due to lower spending for the market expansion and other programs.
During the quarter, the company liquidated its cross-currency swap and paid off $141 million in long-term debt. The company also repurchased 908,100 shares of stock, bringing the total purchased so far this year to almost 1.9 million. Approximately 7.2 million shares remain under the current share repurchase authorization.
Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, were $3.8 billion, up 8 percent versus the first nine months of 2003. Net earnings increased 19 percent to $197 million versus $165 million in 2003. Earnings per share increased 20 percent to $2.15 from $1.79.
Nine Months Results

Year-to-date operating cash flow of $305 million increased 31 percent over the same 2003 period.
A lower tax rate resulting from the reduced tax rate in 2004 in Canada, the realization of tax loss carryforwards for the Mexican operation and capital losses, continued to benefit the company throughout the year. Excluding the results of unconsolidated entities, the effective tax rate declined 2 percentage points versus 2003, adding 7 cents per share to EPS for the first nine months of 2004.
W.W. Grainger, Inc. (NYSE: GWW), with 2003 sales of $4.7 billion, is the leading broad line supplier of facilities maintenance products serving businesses and institutions throughout North America. Through its network of nearly 600 branches, 17 distribution centers and multiple Web sites, Grainger helps customers save time and money by providing them with the right products to keep their facilities running.

For the third quarter of 2003, vendor funded advertising allowances of $10.7 million have been reclassified to cost of merchandise sold from operating (advertising) expenses for comparability. Year-to-date, vendor funded advertising allowances of $41.1 million have been reclassified. 2003 operating earnings were not affected.

I.  EARNINGS REVIEW
Sales in the third quarter benefited from the economy, sales related to the hurricanes in the Southeast and the ongoing benefit of strategic initiatives.
Sales were up 8% driven by an increase in the Branch-based Distribution segment and at Lab Safety. The increase in the Branch-based Distribution segment was primarily driven by strengthening manufacturing and commercial sectors, and sales related to the hurricanes in the Southeast region of the United States. Lab Safety's increase was driven by growth in the sales of safety, maintenance and material handling products. Due to Lab Safety's direct mail model, the hurricanes in the Southeast reduced inbound telephone calls, negatively impacting sales growth in September.
 
The Company's operating earnings were $107 million for the third quarter of 2004 versus $94 million for the third quarter of 2003. Operating earnings for all segments grew faster than their related sales growth. Operating earnings also benefited from the recognition of the effect of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (approximately 1 cent per share). The improvement at the Branch-based segment reflected higher margins and warehouse productivity, partially offset by increased expenses related to strategic initiatives including information technology. The improved results at Lab Safety and Integrated Supply were primarily the result of operating leverage.
The increase in ROIC was primarily attributable to higher operating earnings and improved asset turnover.
For the 2004 third quarter, "Other Income and Expense" was $1.4 million of income versus $0.4 million of income for the 2003 quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to higher net interest income in 2004 versus net interest expense in 2003, as well as an improvement in the results of unconsolidated entities. The 2003 quarter also included a $1.2 million gain on the sale of an investment security.
The Company's effective income tax rate was 37.8% for the 2004 third quarter and 40.0% for the 2003 third quarter. Excluding the effect of equity in unconsolidated entities, which is recorded net of tax, the effective income tax rate was 38.0% for 2004 and 40.0% for 2003. This change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by a lower tax rate in Canada and the realization of tax benefits related to operations in Mexico and to capital losses.

III.  CASH FLOW DATA
       The following is a summarized cash flow statement for the nine months ended September 30 (preliminary):
 
IV.  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
 Sales for this segment were up 9% for the quarter, reflecting the stronger North American economy and sales of approximately $12 million related to the hurricanes in the Southeast region of the United States.
Net Sales
Sales in the United States were up 8% versus 2003 reflecting growth across most customer segments, led primarily by manufacturing. National account sales within these customer segments were up 11% for the quarter. Sales to government accounts were flat reflecting a lower growth rate than recent quarters. This lower growth rate related to military and local and state governments. Sales through the grainger.com Web site were $160 million, a 28% increase versus third quarter 2003 sales of $125 million.
Sales in the first three markets under the market expansion program (Atlanta, Denver and Seattle) grew by 14% in the third quarter of 2004. This phase is approximately 85% complete. The Southern California markets did not show incremental sales growth since this phase is only 30% complete. The third phase (Houston, St. Louis and Tampa) is just beginning. These market expansion programs are now projected to require less capital investment than anticipated.
 *See footnote, page 8.
 
Sales in Canada increased 14% for the quarter versus 2003 due to a stronger economy and the effect of a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, sales for this business were up 8%.
Sales in Mexico were up 20% for the quarter versus 2003 driven by an improving economy, expanded telesales operation and two branch expansions.
 Operating earnings for the 2004 third quarter were up 12% compared with the 2003 period, the result of higher sales and increased gross profits, partially offset by operating expenses which grew faster than sales.
Operating Earnings
The gross profit margin was up 1.6pp versus the comparable 2003 quarter. Contributing to the improvement in gross profit margin were lower product costs and the positive effect of product mix.
Operating expenses increased faster than sales, up 14% for the quarter. The operating expense growth was primarily driven by increased costs related to strategic initiatives, sales commissions and higher bonus and profit sharing accruals. These increases were mitigated by non-commission payroll growing slower than sales due to productivity improvements primarily in the logistics network.
 Sales increased 9% for the quarter for Lab Safety, the Company's direct marketing business. The increase in sales was primarily driven by sales growth of safety, maintenance and material handling products. Sales through the Lab Safety Web sites were up 21% for the quarter.
Net Sales
 Operating earnings grew faster than sales as a result of improved operating expense productivity partially offset by higher healthcare costs.
Operating Earnings
 *See footnote, page 8.
 
 Sales were up 2% for the quarter. Incremental sales at ten customer locations added since the third quarter of 2003 were largely offset by disengagements at two large customers in late 2003. Sales for this business unit include product sales and management fees.
Net Sales
 The operating earnings increase was primarily related to lower data processing expenses versus the prior year.
Operating Earnings
In 2003, the Company adopted those provisions relating to vendor funded advertising allowances per Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor". As a result of the transition rules for EITF Issue 02-16, in 2003 the Company classified $7.9 million as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold rather than a reduction of operating (advertising) expenses. In 2004, most vendor funded advertising allowances will be classified as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold. To maintain comparability, $16.3 million, $14.1 million, $10.7 million and $12.4 million were reclassified for each of the 2003 quarters, respectively. The GAAP financial statements are the source for all amounts used in the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) calculation. ROIC is calculated using annualized operating earnings based on year-to-date operating earnings divided by a ten point average for net working assets. Net working assets are working assets minus working liabilities defined as follows: working assets equal total assets less cash equivalents (non-operating cash), deferred taxes, and investments in unconsolidated entities, plus the LIFO reserve. Working liabilities are the sum of trade payables, accrued compensation and benefits, accrued contributions to employees' profit sharing plans, and accrued expenses.
