CHICAGO, January 27, 2005  Grainger (NYSE: GWW) today reported record sales, earnings and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Sales on a daily basis were up 11 percent. Net earnings of $90 million were up 46 percent versus $62 million in the 2003 fourth quarter. Earnings per share were $0.98 versus $0.67 in the same period 2003. Included in the $0.98 was $0.11 per share related to the realization of certain tax benefits.
"It was an outstanding year," said Grainger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard L. Keyser.

All these position us for further profitable growth."

Sales in the Branch-based Distribution segment increased by 11 percent in the 2004 fourth quarter, or 12 percent on a daily basis. Daily sales in the United States were up 13 percent, with growth in all customer end markets, especially in the manufacturing and commercial sectors. Sales processed through grainger.com increased 27 percent to $157 million from $124 million in the fourth quarter 2003. For the full year, sales through grainger.com were $611 million, up 28 percent versus $479 million in 2003.
Branch-based Distribution
Daily sales in the Phase 1 markets under the market expansion program were up 12 percent for the 2004 fourth quarter and the full year. Daily sales in Phase 2 markets were up 15 percent for the quarter. Phase 1, which includes Atlanta, Denver and Seattle, is 90 percent complete. Phase 2, covering four markets in Southern California, is 50 percent complete. Initiated mid-year 2004, Phase 3, Houston, St. Louis and Tampa, is less than 50 percent complete. During 2004, Grainger opened six full-size branches and 10 Grainger Express locations for will-call pick up, relocated six branches, expanded 13 existing branches and closed three in these 10 markets.
A new branch in Queretaro, a larger, relocated branch in Mexico City, improved telesales efforts and a strengthening Mexican economy resulted in an 18 percent increase in daily sales for the fourth quarter for Mexico. Daily sales in Canada were up 15 percent, aided by a strong Canadian dollar. In local currency, this business had daily sales growth of 7 percent for the quarter. During the year, the company opened two full-size and closed 10 small branches in Canada.
Operating earnings for the Branch-based Distribution segment were up 23 percent for the quarter, due in part to the increased sales and a 3.3 percentage point improvement in gross profit margins. The increase in gross profit margins was primarily due to product cost reduction programs and increased global sourcing of products. Operating expenses increased 19 percent during the quarter, which
 
W.W. Grainger, Inc. - 2004 fourth quarter / twelve months results Page 3 of 6
included spending on two key initiatives  the market expansion program and the SAP implementation. Other areas where operating expenses grew faster than sales included variable compensation and benefits associated with improved performance.
Daily sales for Lab Safety Supply (LSS) increased 6 percent for the quarter. This performance was driven by the strong economy, partially offset by lower sales due to the discontinued customer loyalty program, Harvest Partners. Operating expenses increased by 8 percent due in part to the upgrade of the data processing system, higher catalog media costs and higher variable compensation expense related to the strong performance for the year. Operating earnings for the quarter were down 2 percent.
Lab Safety Supply (LSS)
Daily sales for Integrated Supply were down 5 percent for the quarter due to the continued effect of disengagements of two large customers late in 2003, as well as lower sales to two large, existing customers. The segment had an operating loss of $1 million in the quarter as compared to earnings of $0.5 million in the same period in 2003. As announced late last year, in 2005 Grainger will no longer offer on-site integrated purchasing and tool crib management services. Grainger's Industrial Supply division intends to offer customers an expanded menu of on-site services. The company plans to fulfill but not renew existing Integrated Supply contracts.
Integrated Supply
Beginning January 1, 2005, Integrated Supply will no longer be reported as a separate segment. The business will be merged into Grainger's Industrial Supply division within the Branch-based segment.

The estimated effective tax rate of 38 percent for 2004 included the effects of a lower tax rate in Canada, the realization of tax benefits related to operations in Mexico and to capital losses; these reduced the rate 2.0 percentage points. The effective income tax rate was 29.5 percent for the 2004 fourth quarter. The remaining reduction in the 2004 rate, which increased earnings per share by $0.11, was primarily the result of realized capital loss carrybacks related to investments in securities and the resolution of federal and state tax contingencies. For 2005, the company projects a 1.0 percentage point reduction in its effective tax rate to 37 percent.
Tax Rate
Operating cash flow was $405 million for the year. Capital expenditures were $161 million for the year compared to $80 million in 2003, as investments in the market expansion program, the SAP implementation, the telephony upgrade and Canadian branch and systems projects accelerated in the fourth quarter.
Cash Flow
In 2004, the company repurchased 2.0 million shares of stock. Approximately 7.1 million shares remain under the current share repurchase authorization.
Keyser concluded, "In 2005, we plan to expand into additional markets with improved presence, better product availability and increased sales coverage. By providing outstanding service to our customers, we expect to continue to gain share in this large, fragmented market. We reiterate our projected earnings per share of $3.20 to $3.45 for 2005."

I.  EARNINGS REVIEW
Sales in the fourth quarter benefited from the economy, market share gains, ongoing strategic initiatives and a favorable Canadian exchange rate.
Daily sales were up 11% driven by an increase in the Branch-based Distribution segment and Lab Safety, partially offset by a decrease at Integrated Supply. The increase in the Branch-based Distribution segment was primarily driven by strengthening manufacturing and commercial sectors and a favorable Canadian exchange rate. Lab Safety's increase was driven by growth in the sales of labware, material handling products, and signs and labels. The decrease at Integrated Supply was due to the disengagement of two large customers in late 2003 and the slowdown at two large existing customers, partially offset by incremental sales at sites added during 2004.
 
 
The Company's operating earnings were $124 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 versus $109 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. The operating earnings improvement was driven by the Branch-based Distribution segment reflecting higher gross profit margins and warehouse productivity. Partially offsetting these improvements were increased expenses related to market expansion and information technology initiatives, as well as higher commission, bonus and profit sharing accruals. The Branch-based segment's improvement was partially offset by lower earnings at the Integrated Supply segment and higher operating expenses at headquarters. The higher operating expenses at headquarters related to increases in payroll and benefits, primarily driven by increased bonus and profit sharing accruals.
The increase in ROIC was primarily attributable to higher operating earnings and improved asset turnover.
For the 2004 fourth quarter, "Other Income and Expense" was $3.4 million of income versus $4.3 million of expense for the 2003 quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to the following: net interest income in 2004 versus net interest expense in 2003, an improvement in the results of unconsolidated entities and a $1.2 million gain on the sale of a facility. Additionally, the 2003 quarter included $1.9 million in expense for the write-down of investments in two Asian joint ventures.
The Company's effective income tax rate was 29.5% for the 2004 fourth quarter and 40.9% for the 2003 fourth quarter. This change in effective tax rate included the effects of a lower tax rate in Canada and the realization of tax benefits related to operations in Mexico and to capital losses; these reduced the rate 2.0 percentage points. The remaining reduction in the 2004 rate, which increased earnings per share by $0.11, was primarily the result of realized capital loss carrybacks related to investments in securities and the resolution of federal and state tax contingencies. For 2005, the Company is projecting a 1.0% reduction in its effective tax rate to 37.0%, excluding the effects of equity in unconsolidated entities.

IV.  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
 Daily sales for this segment were up 12% for the quarter, reflecting the stronger North American economy, market share gains and ongoing strategic initiatives in the United States, and a favorable Canadian exchange rate.
Net Sales
Daily sales in the United States were up 13% versus 2003 reflecting growth across most customer segments, led primarily by manufacturing. National account sales within these customer segments were up 16% for the quarter, while sales to government accounts were up 5%. Sales through the grainger.com Web site were $157 million, a 27% increase versus fourth quarter 2003 sales of $124 million.

Daily sales in Phase 2 (covering four markets in Southern California) were up 15% for the quarter. This phase is now approximately 50% complete. Phase 3 (Houston, St. Louis, and Tampa), initiated mid-year 2004, is less than 50% complete.
*See footnote, page 8.
 
Daily sales in Canada increased 15% for the quarter versus 2003 due to a stronger economy and the effect of a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, daily sales for this business were up 7%.
Daily sales in Mexico were up 18% for the quarter versus 2003 driven by an improving economy, expanded telesales operation, the relocation to a larger branch in Mexico City and one new branch in Queretaro.
 Operating earnings for the 2004 fourth quarter were up 23% compared with the 2003 period, the result of higher sales and increased gross profits, partially offset by operating expenses, which grew faster than sales.
Operating Earnings
The gross profit margin was up 3.3pp versus the comparable 2003 quarter. Contributing to the improvement in gross profit margin were lower product purchase costs, higher volume discounts and the positive effect of product mix.
Operating expenses increased faster than sales, up 19% for the quarter. The operating expense growth was primarily driven by increased costs related to strategic initiatives and higher sales commission, bonus and profit sharing accruals. These increases were mitigated by non-commission payroll growing slower than sales due to productivity improvements, primarily in the logistics network.
 Daily sales increased 6% for the quarter for Lab Safety, the Company's direct marketing business. The increase in sales was primarily driven by sales growth of labware, material handling products and signs and labels. Sales through Lab Safety's Web sites were up 24% for the quarter.
Net Sales
 Operating earnings for the 2004 fourth quarter were down 2%. Operating expenses grew faster than sales due in part to the upgrade of Lab Safety's data processing system, higher catalog media costs and higher bonus expense related to the strong performance for the year.
Operating Earnings
 *See footnote, page 8.
 
 Daily sales were down 5% for the quarter. Incremental sales at ten customer locations added since the fourth quarter of 2003 were more than offset by disengagements at two large customers in late 2003. Sales were also down at two large existing customers. Sales for this business unit include product sales and management fees.
Net Sales
 The operating earnings decrease was primarily related to higher data processing expenses and bad debt expense versus the prior year.
Operating Earnings
As announced late last year, in 2005 Integrated Supply will no longer offer on-site integrated puchasing and tool crib management services. The Company's Industrial Supply division plans to fulfill, but not renew, existing Integrated Supply contracts.
Beginning January 1, 2005, Integrated Supply will no longer be reported as a separate segment. It will be merged into the Industrial Supply division within the Branch-based Business segment.
In 2003, the Company adopted those provisions relating to vendor funded advertising allowances per Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor". As a result of the transition rules for EITF Issue 02-16, in 2003 the Company classified $7.9 million as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold rather than a reduction of operating (advertising) expenses. In 2004, most vendor funded advertising allowances were classified as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold. To maintain comparability, $16.3 million, $14.1 million, $10.7 million and $12.4 million were reclassified for each of the 2003 quarters, respectively. : The GAAP financial statements are the source for all amounts used in the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) calculation. ROIC is calculated using annualized operating earnings based on year-to-date operating earnings divided by a 13 point average for net working assets. Net working assets are working assets minus working liabilities defined as follows: working assets equal total assets less cash equivalents (non-operating cash), deferred taxes, and investments in unconsolidated entities, plus the LIFO reserve. Working liabilities are the sum of trade payables, accrued compensation and benefits, accrued contributions to employees' profit sharing plans, and accrued expenses.
