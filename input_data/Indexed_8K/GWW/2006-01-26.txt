GRAINGER REPORTS SALES OF $5.5 BILLION AND
EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $3.78 FOR THE YEAR 2005
 
CHICAGO, January 26, 2006  Grainger (NYSE: GWW) today reported record sales, earnings and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005. Sales of $5.5 billion for 2005 were up 9 percent versus 2004. Net earnings for the year increased 21 percent to $346 million, as compared to $287 million in 2004. Earnings per share grew 21 percent to $3.78 for the year
.
Both 2005 and 2004 benefited from the resolution of certain nonrecurring tax contingencies of $0.10 and $0.11 per share, respectively.
 
"I'm proud of our accomplishments. We posted record results while executing on key initiatives, market and product line expansion programs and systems integration, that should continue to enhance shareholder value," said Grainger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard L. Keyser. He added, "Grainger's core strengths  customer service, the availability of our broad product line, efficient supply chain, integrated information systems and employee commitment  position us well for the future. We continue to project 2006 earnings per share of $4.00 to $4.15, which now includes an estimated $0.15 per share for the expensing of stock options."

Sales in the 2005 fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, up 10 percent versus the prior year fourth quarter. Net earnings of $104 million were up 15 percent versus $90 million in the same period in 2004. Earnings per share were $1.13 versus $0.98 in the 2004 fourth quarter, including tax benefits of $0.10 and $0.11, respectively.
 
Branch-based Distribution
Sales in the Branch-based Distribution segment increased by 10 percent in the 2005 fourth quarter. Sales in the United States were up 9 percent, with growth in all customer sectors except transportation, which declined modestly. The wind-down of integrated supply and automotive-related contracts resulted in a 2 percentage point reduction in U.S. sales growth. In 2005, Grainger disengaged from contracts representing approximately one third of the $211 million in integrated supply sales reported in 2004.
 
The market expansion program, a key growth initiative, contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the 10 percent segment sales growth for the quarter. To date, incremental sales from the program were approximately $150 million. The company is currently enhancing its presence in the top U.S. metropolitan markets. For the market expansion program in 2005, Grainger opened nine full-size branches and five Grainger Express locations, relocated 10 branches, expanded 11 existing branches and closed four. Sales in Phase 1 of the program  Atlanta, Denver and Seattle  grew by 15 percent in the quarter versus fourth quarter 2004. Sales in Phase 2, covering four markets in Southern California, were up 13 percent for the fourth quarter over the same quarter in 2004. Sales in Phase 3  Houston, St. Louis and Tampa  were up 16 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2004. At the end of the fourth quarter 2005, Phase 2 was 90 percent complete and Phase 3 was 70 percent complete.

Sales in Canada continued to benefit from increased activity with the natural resources industry, with overall sales for the quarter up 15 percent, 11 percent in Canadian currency. Sales in Mexico were up 17 percent in the quarter versus the same period in 2004 driven by expanded telesales operations and higher sales to national account customers.
 
Operating earnings for the quarter were up 14 percent in the Branch-based Distribution segment, the result of higher sales and an improved gross profit margin. The segment's gross profit margin benefited from the positive effect of product mix including increased global sourcing of products. Further margin improvement resulted from exiting integrated supply and automotive contracts. Operating expenses grew 12 percent during the quarter. Contributing to the increase were higher sales commissions as well as higher spending on the market expansion program and the SAP implementation. The quarter included extensive testing and employee training on the SAP system.
 
Strong sales from the market expansion program helped offset start-up expenses as the program approached break-even in the quarter. For the year, the program had an operating loss of $16 million versus a $20 million loss in 2004. "Market expansion has exceeded our expectations both in terms of sales and operating results," said Keyser. "Since our primary focus in the first quarter of 2006 is on the successful implementation of SAP, we have not scheduled the opening of any additional market expansion branches until the second quarter when we plan to open branches in additional phases." The company still anticipates sales from this program of $245 million to $275 million and an operating loss of $15 million to $25 million for 2006.

Lab Safety Supply
 
Lab Safety Supply's sales for the quarter were up 16 percent versus the 2004 fourth quarter. Contributing to the growth was the acquisition of the AW Direct business in January 2005. Excluding the acquisition, sales grew 5 percent in the quarter. Operating earnings were up 31 percent for the 2005 fourth quarter. The improvement was due to higher sales from AW Direct and earnings leverage from the rest of the business.
 
Cash Flow
Operating cash flow was $433 million for the year. The company used cash flow from operations to fund growth initiatives, including market expansion and SAP programs, dividends and share repurchases. Capital expenditures were $157 million for 2005 compared to $161 million in 2004. In the quarter, Grainger repurchased 269,900 shares of stock, bringing the total for 2005 to 2.4 million shares. Approximately 4.7 million shares remain under the current repurchase authorization.
 
Other
The effective tax rate was 30.3 percent for the 2005 fourth quarter. The 30.3 percent rate included the recognition of tax benefits related to a favorable revision to the estimate of income taxes for various state taxing jurisdictions and the resolution of federal and state tax contingencies. For the year 2005, the effective tax rate was 35.0 percent. For 2006, the company projects an increase in its effective tax rate to 38.9 percent.

Sales in the fourth quarter benefited from a strong North American economy and ongoing strategic initiatives.
 
 
 
 
Sales were up 10% for the quarter driven by an increase in both segments. The increase in the Branch-based Distribution segment was led by strong sales to the government, contractor, manufacturing and natural resource sectors. Also contributing to the improvement was growth in the U.S. market expansion program. Partially offsetting these improvements was the negative effect of the wind-down of integrated supply and related automotive contracts. Lab Safety benefited from the 2005 acquisition of AW Direct.

The Company's operating earnings were $144 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 versus $125 million for the fourth quarter of 2004. The operating earnings improvement was from both the Branch-based Distribution and Lab Safety segments, partially offset by higher operating expenses at headquarters. Contributing to the increase in expenses at headquarters were increased payroll costs and a $1.0 million donation to the American Red Cross.
 
The increase in ROIC was attributable to higher operating earnings.
 
Other Income and Expense
 
For the 2005 fourth quarter, "Other Income and Expense" was $5.1 million of income versus $2.3 million of income for the 2004 quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to net interest income driven by higher average cash balances and interest rates.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company's effective income tax rate was 30.3% for the 2005 fourth quarter and 29.5% for the 2004 fourth quarter. The 2005 rate included tax benefits related to a favorable revision to the estimate of income taxes for various state taxing jurisdictions and the resolution of federal and state tax contingencies. These benefits increased earnings per share by $0.10.
 
For 2004, the effective tax rate included the effects of a lower tax rate in Canada and the realization of tax benefits related to operations in Mexico and to capital losses; these reduced the rate 2.0 percentage points. The remaining reduction in the 2004 rate, which increased earnings per share by $0.11, was primarily the result of realized capital loss carrybacks related to investments in securities and the resolution of federal and state tax contingencies.
 
For 2006, the Company is projecting an effective tax rate of 38.9%, excluding the effects of equity in unconsolidated entities, versus the 2005 effective tax rate of 35.0%, which included the benefit mentioned above.

BRANCH-BASED DISTRIBUTION (continued)
 
Results for the market expansion program were as follows:
 
 
Overall, market expansion contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the 10% sales growth.
 
Sales in Canada increased 15% for the quarter versus 2004 due to a stronger economy, primarily in the natural resources sector, and the effect of a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, sales for this business were up 11%.
 
Sales in Mexico were up 17% for the quarter versus 2004 driven by an expanded telesales operation, higher sales to national account customers and a stronger economy.
 
Operating Earnings
 Branch-based operating earnings for the 2005 fourth quarter were up 14% compared with the 2004 period, the result of higher sales and improved gross profit margins, partially offset by operating expenses, which grew faster than sales. The market expansion initiative approached break-even from an operating earnings standpoint for the fourth quarter versus a loss in the 2004 quarter.
 
The gross profit margin was up 1.2 percentage points versus the comparable 2004 quarter. Contributing to the improvement in gross profit margin were selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix, partially offset by higher freight costs and a lower margin in Canada. A major driver of the improvement in the selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers.
 
The operating expense growth was primarily driven by increased costs related to market expansion and the SAP implementation, higher payroll costs, an increase in the number of sales representatives and higher sales commissions.

The GAAP financial statements are the source for all amounts used in the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) calculation. ROIC is calculated using annualized operating earnings based on year-to-date operating earnings divided by a thirteen point average for net working assets. Net working assets are working assets minus working liabilities defined as follows: working assets equal total assets less cash equivalents (non-operating cash), deferred taxes, and investments in unconsolidated entities, plus the LIFO reserve. Working liabilities are the sum of trade payables, accrued compensation and benefits, accrued contributions to employees' profit sharing plans, and accrued expenses.
