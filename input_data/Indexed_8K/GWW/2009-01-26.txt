CHICAGO, January 26, 2009  Grainger (NYSE: GWW) today reported record sales, earnings and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Sales of $6.9 billion were up 7 percent versus 2007.  Net earnings of $475 million increased 13 percent versus $420 million in 2007.  Earnings per share of $6.04 increased 22 percent versus $4.94 in 2007.
 
Grainger had another record year in 2008, said President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Ryan.  We were pleased with our operating performance, particularly given the challenging economic environment in the fourth quarter.  Our 11.4 percent operating margin was an improvement of approximately 100 basis points over 2007.
 
 
The GAAP financial statements are the source for all amounts used in the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) calculation.  ROIC is calculated using annualized operating earnings based on year-to-date operating earnings divided by a 13 point average for net working assets.  Net working assets are working assets minus working liabilities defined as follows:  working assets equal total assets less cash equivalents (non operating cash), deferred taxes, and investments in unconsolidated entities, plus the LIFO reserve.  Working liabilities are the sum of trade payables, accrued compensation and benefits, accrued contributions to employees profit sharing plans, and accrued expenses.

Ryan said, At the same time we were expanding our operating margins, we also made great progress on our market expansion and product line expansion programs.  These programs should continue to help us gain share during the current economic environment.
 
Ryan added, We cannot accurately predict or control the economy, however, we can control how we run the business.  We are focusing on our strengths of helping customers save money through a broad offering of products, fast delivery, outstanding customer service and a strong balance sheet to back it up.  
 
He concluded, In November, we gave annual sales guidance of -5% to +5% for 2009. Since then, the macroeconomic trends have deteriorated. Based on our sales run rate in January, we are somewhat below the low end of this range, so we are implementing actions now in anticipation of weak sales results. Given the great uncertainty in the economy, we are not providing 2009 annual sales and earnings guidance at this time.
 
For Graingers 2008 fourth quarter, sales were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 1 percent versus the 2007 fourth quarter.  There were 64 sales days in both the 2008 and 2007 fourth quarters.  Daily sales increased 4 percent in October, decreased 2 percent in November and decreased 5 percent in December.  The 1 percent decline for the quarter included a 2 percentage point decline from foreign exchange, offset by a net 1 percentage point lift from price and volume.  Net earnings of $108 million increased 3 percent versus $104 million in 2007.  Earnings per share of $1.39 increased 9 percent versus $1.28 in 2007.  Included in net earnings was a $6 million write down of Graingers investment in a joint venture in India, or $0.08 per share.
 
Grainger Branch-based segment
Daily sales in the 2008 fourth quarter for this segment, which includes branch-based businesses in the United States, Mexico, China and Panama, were flat.  Daily sales grew by 5 percent in October, declined by 2 percent in November and declined by 5 percent in December.
 
During the quarter, the company opened two new full-service branches in the United States and closed one storefront location.  As part of the market expansion program in Mexico, the company opened two new branches.

As a result of relocating branches under the U.S. market expansion program, the company sold one branch for a gain of $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to a gain of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.  For the full year, the company sold 7 branches for a gain of $9.7 million as compared to gains on the sale of property in 2007 of $6.6 million.  The market expansion program in the United States is now complete.
 
In the United States, sales in the quarter decreased 1 percent.  The largest declines came from heavy manufacturing, retail and contractors, partially offset by an increase in sales to the government sector.
 
Results for market expansion by phase were:

Market expansion contributed $476 million in incremental sales in 2008 versus $402 million in 2007.  Program related operating earnings were $43.2 million in 2008 versus $21.4 million in 2007.  Consistent with the overall downturn in the economy, beginning in October most of these markets saw negative sales growth, which significantly affected sales and operating margin results for the quarter and year.  We are pleased with customer response to the upgrades.  We expect the program to continue to yield incremental benefits through 2013, said Ryan.  As a result, we plan to selectively make upgrades in other markets in the future.
 
Product line expansion contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the quarterly growth for this segment.  Products added over the last three years delivered $687 million in sales in 2008, which exceeded the companys expectations.
 
Sales in Mexico were down 11 percent in U.S. dollars for the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2007, but were up 8 percent in local currency.  Sales benefited from Mexicos market expansion program including the seven new branches opened in 2008, but the rate of growth slowed as a result of the weakening U.S. and Mexican economies.
 
Operating earnings for the quarter were up 13 percent in the Grainger branch-based segment despite the 1 percent decline in sales.  This positive operating leverage was t
he result of a 1 percent improvement in gross profit margins and a 2 percent decline in operating expenses.  Contributing to the decline in operating expenses were lower advertising expenses, bonus accruals, sales commissions, severance and lower bad debt provisions, due to improved collection efficiency.
 
Acklands-Grainger Branch-based segment
Sales for the quarter were down 6 percent versus the 2007 fourth quarter in U.S. dollars, up 16 percent in local currency.  On a daily basis, sales in local currency were up 18 percent in October, 18 percent in November and 15 percent in December. 
Strong sales to agriculture, mining, oil and gas and government customers were
partially offset by weakness in the forestry sector.  During the quarter, Acklands did not open or close any branches and ended the year at 154 branches.

Operating earnings declined 14 percent in the 2008 fourth quarter, but increased 5 percent in local currency.  This improvement resulted from increased sales and improved gross profit margins, partially offset by higher operating expenses which included expenses related to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services.
 
Lab Safety Supply (LSS)
Sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were down 3 percent versus the 2007 fourth quarter. Daily sales were up 3 percent in October, down 2 percent in November and down 11 percent in December.  Sales from the acquisition of Highsmith contributed 9 percentage points to growth in the quarter.  Excluding this acquisition, sales were down by 12 percent reflecting continued weakness with Lab Safetys government and manufacturing customers.  Operating earnings declined 57 percent for the quarter, due to lower sales and gross profit margins, and higher operating expenses related to integration costs for the Highsmith acquisition.
 
Other
During the quarter, the company recorded net interest expense of $3.5 million versus $0.2 million of net interest expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007.  This was primarily the result of the $500 million in intermediate debt obtained in May 2008.
 
In the fourth quarter, the company wrote down its entire investment in Asia Pacific Brands India Ltd.  The write down, due to the inability of Asia Pacific Brands India Ltd. to maintain adequate operating capital, resulted in a $0.08 per share charge.  The weakened global economy significantly affected Asia Pacific Brands outlook, including the bankruptcy of one of its major suppliers.  This write down combined with the $0.05 per share charge the company took in the second quarter relating to a legal settlement with the government, made up the $0.13 per share in unusual items for the year.
 
The effective income tax rate was 37.9 percent and 38.1 percent in the 2008 and 2007 fourth quarters, respectively.  Excluding the effect of after tax items related to the write down and the earnings of unconsolidated entities, the effective tax rate for the 2008 fourth quarter was 36.7 percent versus 38.5 percent in the 2007 fourth quarter.  The lower effective tax rate for 2008 was primarily the result of a lower weighted average state tax rate and an increased deductibility of executive compensation expenses.
 
For the full year, the effective income tax rate was 38.5 percent in 2008 and 38.4 percent in 2007.  For 2009, the company is estimating its effective tax rate to be approximately 38.9 percent, excluding the effect of equity in net income of unconsolidated entities.
 
Cash flow
Operating cash flow was $195 million for quarter and $530 million for the year.  The company paid $31 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 1.4 million shares of stock for $104 million in the quarter.  In 2008 the company used cash from operations to fund growth initiatives through capital expenditures of $195 million and returned $516 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
 
Approximately 7.4 million shares remain under the current repurchase authorization at the end of the year.
