INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN REPORT Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure On March 14, 2003 registrant issued a press release entitled "Halliburton Files Affidavit On Global Asbestos Settlement." The text of the press release is as follows: HALLIBURTON FILES AFFIDAVIT ON GLOBAL ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT Company says it believes it meets the court-imposed deadline Houston, Texas - Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) today announced the filing of an affidavit with the court in the Harbison-Walker bankruptcy case that it believes is consistent with the court order of February 18, 2003. The court order had extended its previously issued temporary restraining order, staying the more than 200,000 pending asbestos claims against Halliburton's subsidiary, DII Industries, LLC (DII), until March 21, 2003. The court order also stated that oral arguments would be held on March 21, 2003 on a motion to lift the stay, unless DII filed an affidavit by March 14, 2003 stating that executed agreements had been signed by an estimated 75% of DII's asbestos plaintiffs. The affidavit filed today by DII stated that DII and KBR have definitive written agreements, or written "highly confident" representations that such definitive agreements are forthcoming, from attorneys representing an estimated 75% of claimants. These estimates are based on certain assumptions and exclude the impact of certain claims in the Harbison-Walker bankruptcy, for which the Company indicated it had certain defenses or did not have reliable information. Halliburton, founded in 1919, is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the petroleum and energy industries. The company serves its customers with a broad range of products and services through its Energy Services Group and Engineering and Construction Group business segments.
