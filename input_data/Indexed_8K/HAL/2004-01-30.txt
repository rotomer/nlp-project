INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN REPORT Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition On January 29, 2004 registrant issued a press release entitled "Halliburton Announces Fourth Quarter Results." HALLIBURTON ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS $0.34 per diluted share income from continuing operations HOUSTON - Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) announced today that fourth quarter 2003 income from continuing operations was $146 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. The net loss for the quarter was $947 million, or $2.17 per diluted share, and included a net loss from discontinued operations for the proposed asbestos and silica settlement of $1.1 billion, or $2.51 per diluted share. Revenues were $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2003, up 63% from the fourth quarter 2002. This increase was largely attributable to additional activity on government services projects in the Middle East in the Engineering and Construction Group (known as KBR). Operating income was $303 million in the fourth quarter 2003 compared to a $21 million loss in the fourth quarter 2002. Fourth quarter 2002 results included a $234 million loss related to the proposed asbestos and silica settlement and $29 million in restructuring charges. "I am pleased with the overall improvements in our financial performance as both KBR and the Energy Services Group ("ESG") delivered solid operating results for the 2003 fourth quarter," said Dave Lesar, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Halliburton. "The fourth quarter was also strategically significant as we took a major step toward resolving our asbestos and silica liability, and we continued to perform well for our customers in Iraq. In ESG, we benefited from increased oilfield activity in the United States and Canada, and from improved competitive position in international markets such as Norway, Mexico, the Middle East, and Algeria. Looking ahead to 2004, customer spending is expected to accelerate over the course of the year, although our first quarter results are expected to be affected by normal seasonal softness." -more-
Proposed Asbestos and Silica Settlement In December 2003, as part of the previously announced plan to resolve its asbestos and silica liabilities through a prepackaged bankruptcy, the company's DII Industries, Kellogg Brown & Root, Inc. and other affected subsidiaries filed Chapter 11 proceedings in bankruptcy court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the company adjusted its asbestos and silica liability to reflect the full amount of the proposed settlement, which together with related expenses resulted in a before and after-tax charge of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2003. The tax effect on this charge was minimal, as a valuation allowance was established for the net operating loss carryforward created by the charge. 2003 Fourth Quarter Segment Results Energy Services Group ESG posted fourth quarter 2003 revenues of $1.8 billion, an $85 million increase over the fourth quarter 2002, and operating income of $241 million, up $42 million for the same period in the prior year. Drilling and Formation Evaluation revenues for the fourth quarter 2003 were $417 million, essentially flat from the fourth quarter 2002. The first quarter 2003 sale of Mono Pumps negatively impacted revenue comparisons between the fourth quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2002 by $20 million. Latin America revenues increased $9 million due to new contracts for logging services in Mexico and the introduction of our rotary steerables in Brazil. Revenues in the North America and Middle East/Asia regions increased modestly. However, the Mono Pumps sale, a 6% decrease in rig count, and the completion of certain logging contracts in West Africa contributed to a $13 million decline in revenues for the Europe/Africa region. Operating income of $17 million represented a 62% decrease compared to the fourth quarter 2002. This primarily reflects a decline in offshore activity by key customers. Also, the fourth quarter of 2003 included $8 million of expenses related to the consolidation of two drill bit manufacturing facilities in the Woodlands, Texas announced last quarter and severance cost for the drill bit and directional drilling businesses in the United States and Western Europe, consistent with reduced activity in these markets. Fluids revenues for the fourth quarter 2003 were $531 million, a 15% increase over the fourth quarter 2002. The increase was driven by a $22 million increase in United States cementing services due to higher land rig count, a $15 million increase in drilling fluid revenues on new contract awards in Mexico, and an $11 million increase in drilling fluid revenues attributed to the start-up of a majority-owned drilling fluids joint venture in Algeria. Revenues were up in each geographic region. Fluids operating income for the fourth quarter 2003 was $73 million, a $25 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2002. The majority of the increase in operating income was attributable to the increase in revenues, as well as Nigeria charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 which adversely impacted operating income in that period. -more-
Production Optimization revenues for the fourth quarter 2003 were $714 million, a 9% increase over the fourth quarter 2002. North America revenues improved 14% over fourth quarter 2002 on increased rig activity. Internationally, revenues were up in the Latin America and Middle East/Asia regions, while down 5% in the Europe/Africa region. The sale of Halliburton Measurement Systems in the second quarter 2003 negatively impacted revenue comparisons by $9 million. Production Optimization operating income for the fourth quarter 2003 was $116 million, a 26% increase over the fourth quarter 2002. Improved international activity levels, as well as a more favorable sales mix in completion products and sand control services, drove the majority of the increase in operating income. The improvement in operating income from production enhancement services and completion products and services more than offset the $11 million in equity losses from the Subsea 7 joint venture. Landmark and Other Energy Services revenues for the fourth quarter 2003 were $137 million, a decrease of $48 million from the fourth quarter 2002. The reduction of revenues was attributable to the sale of Wellstream in the first quarter 2003 and lower customer information technology spending. Landmark and Other Energy Services fourth quarter 2003 operating income was $35 million, compared to $14 million in the fourth quarter 2002. Fourth quarter 2002 segment operating income included $17 million in restructuring charges. Although Landmark Graphics revenues and operating income were down 7% and 4%, respectively, as compared to the fourth quarter 2002, for the year 2003, Landmark Graphics recorded their highest level of operating income, an 18% improvement over 2002 and the highest operating margins since the company acquired it. KBR KBR revenues for the fourth quarter 2003 were $3.7 billion, more than double its revenues in the fourth quarter 2002. The improvement was mostly due to increased government related activities in the Middle East, and to a lesser extent, revenues from oil and gas projects in Algeria, a hydrocarbon plant in Belgium, and increased activities in the Devonport Management Limited (DML) shipyard. Partially offsetting the increases were lower revenues from the Barracuda-Caratinga project in Brazil, an offshore project in Indonesia, an oil project in Western Africa nearing completion, and lower activities on operations and maintenance projects. KBR operating income for the fourth quarter 2003 was $82 million, compared to a $189 million loss in the fourth quarter 2002. Included in the fourth quarter 2002 loss was a $234 million charge related to the proposed asbestos and silica settlement. Fourth quarter 2003 operating results included increased operating income on government services operations in the Middle East and an $18 million benefit from better than expected insurance loss experience. Total company revenue and operating income from Iraq-related work in the fourth quarter 2003 were $2.2 billion and $44 million, respectively. Iraq-related work contributed $0.06 per diluted share of earnings after tax. -more-
Backlog KBR backlog at December 31, 2003 was $9.7 billion, down $100 million from September 30, 2003. Approximately 26% of the backlog was for fixed fee contracts, compared to 31% at September 30, 2003. Of the fixed fee contract backlog, 40% of the total related to onshore contracts, 29% related to government services contracts and 18% related to offshore contracts. Firm orders were $8.6 billion at the end of the quarter. The remainder of the backlog primarily related to government awards not yet funded. In addition, subsequent to year-end, KBR was awarded two new contracts: CENTCOM, with a contract value up to $1.5 billion, and RIO continuation, with a contract value up to $1.2 billion, which were not included in the year-end backlog. Technology and Significant Achievements Halliburton had a number of advances in technology and new contract awards. KBR new contract awards: o KBR was awarded the contract to continue its operations for the Restore Iraqi Oil program in the southern section of Iraq by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The contract has a value of up to $1.2 billion over two years, with three one-year optional extensions. The contract will cover a full range of services, including extinguishing oil well fires; environmental assessments and cleanup at oil sites; oil infrastructure condition assessments; engineering design and construction necessary to restore the infrastructure to a safe operating condition; oilfield, pipeline and refinery maintenance; procurement and importation of fuel products; distribution of fuel products within Iraq; technical assistance in marketing and sales/export; and technical assistance and consulting services to the Iraqi oil companies. o KBR was awarded a contract for up to $1.5 billion over five years by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to support United States military operations, other federal agencies and friendly governments anywhere in the United States Central Command's area of operations, a 25-country region extending from the Horn of Africa to Central Asia. o KBR was awarded a five-year integrated support contract by ChevronTexaco to supply operations, maintenance and engineering support on the Alba, Captain and Erskine production facilities in the North Sea. -more-
Energy Services Group new technologies and contracts: o Halliburton was awarded a five-year contract, valued at $25 million, from the Department of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria. The contract calls for the design, development and operation of a National Data Repository using Landmark Graphics' PetroBank technology, among the most advanced multi-client data management systems in the E&P industry. This represents the seventh National Data Repository, with others in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, UK, Brazil, Norway and Indonesia. o Halliburton added four technologies to its suite of production optimization services: Reservoir Performance Monitoring (RPM); DepthStar(TM)tubing retrievable safety valve; WaterWeb(SM) technology; and SilverStim(TM) LT fracturing fluid system. RPM provides high-reliability, permanent downhole monitoring solutions focused on optimizing production, maximizing reserves and maintaining completions integrity. The DepthStar valve is a revolutionary concept in the realm of surface controlled subsurface safety valves which function completely independent of well pressure. WaterWeb service is based on relative permeability modifier technology and is the result of an ongoing research and development program to help operators control the production of unwanted water. SilverStim LT fracturing service results in a step change in how fracturing fluids are used and applied in the field. o Halliburton recently performed a record-breaking deepwater well test operation for Statoil at the Ellida structure in the Norwegian Sea. The test, performed from the dynamically positioned drill ship, West Navigator, at a water depth of more than 1,200 meters, is the first well test performed at such a water depth off the Norwegian coast. o Halliburton successfully implemented a customized, Linux-based data and applications hosting system for Unocal's Deepwater Group in Jakarta, Indonesia. Landmark Graphics implemented the system in July 2003 and will provide management, maintenance and on-site application support over a three-year period. o Halliburton developed a high-performance alternative to synthetic-based drilling fluids with its new PerformaDril(TM) water-based fluid system. The PerformaDril water-based system was used to drill highly reactive smectite and mixed layer clays on a North Sea well in the Kristin field. Where zero discharge regulations apply to the use of synthetic-based fluids, the excellent inhibition and drilling performance demonstrated by the system provide another option for achieving wellbore stability. Halliburton, founded in 1919, is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the petroleum and energy industries. The company serves its customers with a broad range of products and services through its Energy Services and Engineering and Construction Groups.
