INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN REPORT Item 5. Other Events On February 11, 2004 registrant issued a press release entitled "Insurers Denied Standing." The text of the press release is as follows: INSURERS DENIED STANDING HOUSTON, Texas - Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) announced today that the Honorable Judith K. Fitzgerald issued a ruling this morning holding that insurers lack standing to bring motions seeking to dismiss the prepackaged reorganization cases filed by DII Industries, Kellogg Brown & Root ("KBR") and various other subsidiaries of Halliburton. The court also denied standing to insurers to object to appointment of Professor Eric Green as legal representative of future claimants. The bankruptcy court has scheduled hearings for May 10-12 to consider confirmation of the prepackaged plan of reorganization being proposed for DII Industries, KBR and other affected subsidiaries. At the same hearing, the court also will be asked to approve the disclosure statement and procedures used in connection with solicitation of votes on the proposed plan. DII Industries, KBR and other affected subsidiaries filed chapter 11 proceedings on December 16, 2003 in bankruptcy court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania after receiving validly cast votes in favor of the plan from over 98% of those asbestos claimants and 99% of those silica claimants who voted on the plan.
