SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 DATE OF REPORT (date of earliest event reported) March 19, 2004 Halliburton Company (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) State or other Commission IRS Employer jurisdiction File Number Identification of incorporation Number Delaware 1-3492 No. 75-2677995 1401 McKinney, Suite 2400 Houston, Texas 77010 (Address of principal executive offices) Registrant's telephone number, including area code - 713-759-2600
INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN REPORT Item 5. Other Events. We were informed via correspondence from the Department of the Army dated March 12 and 18, 2004 that they will begin withholding payment on 15 percent of undefinitized task order invoices related to services performed by our subcontractors under our LogCAP contract beginning April 30, 2004. Whether the Federal Acquisition Regulation allows the Department of the Army to withhold these amounts is complex and subject to interpretation. While we do not believe our LogCAP contract is subject to these provisions and are working with our customer to address this issue, we will adjust our applicable invoices for the 15 percent withholding beginning April 30, 2004 until the definitization process is completed, which we believe will be concluded in a matter of months. To the extent we are subject to the 15 percent withholding, we will withhold similar amounts from our subcontractors' invoices to us. As a result, we do not expect this to have a significant or sustained impact on our liquidity. The Department of the Army has also informed us that they may postpone the implementation date for another 30 days pending further review.
