On September 23, 2004, we announced that KBR, our engineering and construction subsidiary, will be reorganized from five product lines to two divisions: energy and chemicals, and government and infrastructure. As a result, we expect to record roughly $30 million in related, one-time charges in the 2004 third quarter. After KBR's plan of reorganization to implement its proposed asbestos and silica settlement becomes effective, we expect to make a decision on whether to separate the KBR unit through a sale, spin-off or initial public offering.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
