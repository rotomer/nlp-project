Shelf Registration Statement
. The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC at least 30 days prior to the Funding Date a "shelf" registration statement (the "Shelf Registration Statement" and any registration effected pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement being referred to as a "Shelf Registration") for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act covering the Subject Shares. The Shelf Registration Statement shall be on Form S-3 or another appropriate form permitting registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by the Stockholder. The Company shall not permit any Securities other than the Registrable Securities to be included in the Shelf Registration Statement.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act on or as soon as possible after the Funding Date and to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until the date that is one year from the Funding Date or such shorter period ending when all Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Shelf Registration Statement or cease to be outstanding or cease to be Registrable Securities (the "Effectiveness Period");
provided
,
however
, that if (i) the Company exercises its right to suspend the Shelf Registration in accordance with section 4.1(b)(i) below or (ii) the Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective under the Securities Act on the Funding Date, then (A) the Effectiveness Period in respect of the related Shelf Registration Statement shall be extended by the same number of days as the suspension period invoked by the Company or the number of days from the Funding Date until the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, respectively, or both, if applicable, and (B) notwithstanding section 3.1, the Stockholder may Transfer the Subject Shares pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement during such extension of the Effectiveness Period, subject to the Agreed Volume Limit ations, as the Agreed Volume Limitations may be increased pursuant to section 4.1(b)(iii).
(b)
Limitations
.
(i) The Company shall have the right to suspend the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration at any time if (A) its Chief Executive Officer determines, in his good faith judgment, that the registration and distribution of Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration would, materially impede, delay or interfere with any firm commitment underwritten offering of Securities by the Company (including an offering involving sales of Securities to initial purchasers who intend to resell the Securities under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, Regulation S or to accredited investors (as defined in the Securities Act)) or any material acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the Company, or (B) its Chief Executive Officer determines, in his good faith judgment based on advice of counsel , that the registration and distribution of Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration would require disclosure of material nonpublic information, and that the disclosure of such information at that time would materially and adversely affect the Company. If either of subclauses (A) or (B) above apply, the Company will have the right to suspend the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration for a period of not more than 90 days;
provided
,
however
, that the Company may not use the right set forth in this clause (i): (x) more than once during the Effectiveness Period; (y) unless each director and executive officer of the Company is al so prohibited by the Company's insider trading policy or otherwise from making purchases and sales (other than those made pursuant to plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act) for the same reason for which the Shelf Registration is being suspended; and (z) unless each other holder entitled to sell equity Securities pursuant to registration rights under a selling stockholder prospectus (other than a registration in which the only Common Stock being registered is Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt or equity Securities that are also being registered) is, or agrees to be, subject to deferral provisions substantially similar to, or more restrictive than, those contained in this clause (i).
(ii) The Company shall give notice to the Stockholder at the beginning of any suspension period under this section 4.1(b). Following the end of any such suspension period, the Company shall give prompt notice to the Stockholder, make any other filing with the SEC required of it or terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and take all such other commercially reasonable actions to permit registered sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated hereby. It is understood and agreed that this section 4.1(b) shall not prevent a Transfer permitted by section 3.1(b)(iii) or (vi).
(iii) If (A) the Company invokes its right to suspend the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration pursuant to section 4.1(b)(i) or (B) the Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective under the Securities Act on the Funding Date, then the Agreed Volume Limitations in the Three-Month Period subsequent to any Three-Month Period in which (x) such a suspension occurs or is continuing or (y) such Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective under the Securities Act, as applicable, shall be increased by an amount of Subject Shares equal to the difference between (I) the product of (a) the maximum number of Subject Shares permitted to be Transferred pursuant to section 3.1(b)(i) and (iv) in the Three-Month Period in which the suspension occurred or is continuing or in which the Shelf Registration S tatement is not declared effective under the Securities Act, assuming such suspension had not occurred or been continuing and such Shelf Registration Statement had been declared effective under the Securities Act on the Funding Date and (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate number of days that the Shelf Registration was not effective and/or was suspended in the Three-Month Period and the denominator of which is 91, and (II) the number of Subject Shares actually Transferred pursuant to section 3.1(b)(i) and (iv) in such Three-Month Period.
(c)
Penalty Interest
. The Company and the Stockholder agree that the Stockholder will suffer damages if the Company fails to fulfill its obligations under this section 4.1 and that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision.

(i) If the Shelf Registration Statement has not been declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the 91st day after the Funding Date then, commencing on the Funding Date, Penalty Interest shall accrue and be calculated daily at the Penalty Rate on an amount equal to the product of (A) the Share Amount and (B) the Trading Price;
provided
,
however
, that all Penalty Interest shall cease to accrue upon the earliest to occur of (x) the expi ration of the first anniversary of the Funding Date, (y) the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, and (z) such time as there are no Registrable Securities outstanding.
(ii) As used in this section 4.1(c) the term "Penalty Rate" means:
(A) 5% per annum during the first 91 days after the Funding Date;
(B) 10% per annum from day 92 through day 182 after the Funding Date;
(C) 20% per annum from day 183 through day 273 after the Funding Date; and

(B) for purposes of calculating the Penalty Interest accruing from day 92 through day 182 after the Funding Date, 15 million Subject Shares;
(C) for purposes of calculating the Penalty Interest accruing from day 183 through day 273 after the Funding Date, the sum of (x) 15 million Subject Shares plus (y) the Penalty Average Weekly Trading Volume applicable to days 183 through 273 after the Funding Date, and
(D) for purposes of calculating the Penalty Interest accruing from day 273 through day 365 after the Funding Date, the sum of (x) 15 million Subject Shares plus (y) the Penalty Average Weekly Trading Volume applicable to days 183 through 273 after the Funding Date plus (z) the Penalty Average Weekly Trading Volume applicable to days 274 through 365 after the Funding Date.
(iv) Any amounts of Penalty Interest due pursuant to this section 4.1(c) will be payable in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Stockholder within five Business Days of (A) the 91st day following the Funding Date, (B) the 182nd day following the Funding Date, (C) the 273rd day following the Funding Date, and (D) the 365th day following the Funding Date;
provided
,
however
that if the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective during one of such periods, then the Penalty Interest payable shall be prorated for such period to the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement.
(v) Notwithstanding the forgoing, any suspension of effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration pursuant to section 4.1(b)(i) above shall not give rise to the obligation of the Company to pay Penalty Interest or result in the accrual of Penalty Interest.
4.2
Demand Registration Rights
. After the Preliminary Restriction Period and prior to the Demand Registration Rights Termination Date, the Stockholder shall have demand registration rights as follows:
(a)
Exercise of Demand Registration Rights

The Demand Request shall specify the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the manner of distribution.
(b)
Underwriting Requirements
. If requested by the Stockholder, the offering to be made pursuant to any Demand Registration shall be an underwritten offering. The Stockholder shall have the right to select all underwriters for any Securities being offered pursuant to any Demand Request;
provided, however,
that, the underwriters selected by the Stockholder shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Stockholder shall participate, and include those Registrable Securities, in the underwriting as provided in this Agreement. If the lead managing underwriter for an offering determines in its sole discretion that the total amount of Securities proposed to be included in such offering is of such an amount as would have a material adverse effect on the offering's success, then the Company shall have the right to reduce the number of Securities included in the offering to a number that the lead managing underwriter determines in its sole discretion would not have a material adverse effect on the offering's success. In the event a reduction occurs, the amount of Securities to be included in the offering shall be reduced as follows:
(i) to the extent necessary to reduce the total number of Securities to be included in such offering to the amount that the lead managing underwriter determines in its sole discretion would not have a material adverse effect on the offering's success, Securities offered for the account of any stockholder, other than the Stockholder, shall be excluded from the offering;
(ii) to the extent further reduction is necessary, after application of clause (i) above, to reduce the total number of Securities to be included in such offering to the amount that the lead managing underwriter determines in its sole discretion would not have a material adverse effect on the offering's success, Securities offered for the account of the Company, shall be excluded from the offering; and
(iii) to the extent further reduction is necessary, after application of clauses (i) and (ii) above, to reduce the total number of Securities to be included in such offering to the amount that the lead managing underwriter determines in its sole discretion would not have a material adverse effect on the offering's success, Registrable Securities offered for the account of the Stockholder shall be excluded.
(c)
Limitations
.
(i) The Company will not be obligated to initiate any Demand Registration at any time if (A) doing so would breach any provision of any Stockholder's agreement entered into pursuant to section 4.6(d), (B) in the good faith judgment of its Chief Executive Officer, the registration and distribution of Registrable Securities in a Demand Registration would materially impede, delay or interfere with any firm commitment underwritten offering of Securities by the Company (including an offering involving sales of Securities to initial purchasers who intend to resell the Securities under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, Regulation S or to accredited investors (as defined in the Securities Act)) on which the Company has commenced work prior to receiving a Demand Request, (C) in the good faith judgment of the Chief E xecutive Officer of the Company, the registration and distribution of Registrable Securities in a Demand Registration would materially impede any material acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the Company, or (D) its Chief Executive Officer determines, in his good faith judgment based on advice of counsel, that the registration and distribution of Registrable Securities in a Demand Registration would require disclosure of material non-public information, and that the disclosure of such information at that time would materially and adversely affect the Company. If any of subclauses (A) through (D) above apply, the Company shall have the right to defer the filing or effectiveness of the registration statement relating to such Demand Registration for a period of not more than 120 days after receipt of the Demand Request;
provided, however
, that the Company may not use the right set forth in this clause (i): (x) more than once in any twelve month period, (y) unless each director and executive officer of the Company is also prohibited by the Company's insider trading policy or otherwise from making purchases and sales (other than those made pursuant to plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act) for the same reason for which the Demand Registration is being deferred, and (z) except for a deferral pursuant to clause (B), unless each other holder entitled to sell equity Securities pursuant to registration rights under a selling stockholder prospectus (other than a registration in which the only Common Stock being registered is Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt or equity Securities that are also being registered) is, or agrees to be, subject to deferral provisions substantially similar to or more restrictive than those contained in this clause ( i).
(ii) The Company will only be obligated to initiate a Demand Registration if the amount of Registrable Securities to be registered and sold pursuant to this section 4.2 in the aggregate (A) is greater than or equal to either (x) 5 million shares of Common Stock or (y) a Market Value of $100 million and (B) is less than or equal to 25 million shares of Common Stock (as adjusted for stock splits, stock distributions, reclassifications or other reorganizations of the Company's capital stock).

4.8
Indemnification
. The rights and obligations of the Company and the Stockholder with respect to indemnification for matters set forth in this section 4 are as follows:
(a)
Company's Indemnification
. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder, each underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for the Stockholder, each Person, if any, who controls the Stockholder or each underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, and each of their respective constituent partners, members, employees, agents, contractors, officers and directors against any losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties, assessments by public agencies, settlement, costs and expenses (including costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees) and o ther liabilities (any of the foregoing being a "Loss") that relate in any way to any Violation. The Company shall pay to each Person entitled to indemnification under this section 4.8(a) the amount of Losses they incur as they incur such Losses. However, the Company will not need to pay any indemnified Person the amount of (i) Losses that are settlement payments if such indemnified Person makes the settlement without the Company's consent (so long as the Company did not unreasonably withhold its consent), or (ii) Losses to the extent such Losses arise out of a Violation that occurs because the Company relied on written information about the indemnified Person that the indemnified Person furnished to the Company expressly for the Company to use in connection with the applicable registration or (iii) Losses, in the case of any Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of Registrable Securities or any other Person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning o f the Securities Act, or any constituent partner, member, employee, agent, contractor, officer or director of any such underwriter, in any such case to the extent such Losses arise out of such underwriter's failure to send or give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may be then supplemented or amended, to the Person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities to such Person if such statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus.
(b)
Stockholder's Indemnification
. In connection with any offering in which Registrable Securities of the Stockholder are included pursuant to section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.4 hereof, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Stockholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), each Person, if any, who controls the Company or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and each of their respective constituent partners, members, employees, agents, contractors, officers and directors against any Losses to the extent such Losses arise out of a Violation that occ urs because the Company relied on written information about the Stockholder that the Stockholder furnished to the Company expressly for the Company to use in connection with the applicable registration;
provided
,
however
, that in no event shall the Stockholder be liable pursuant to this section 4.8(b) for any Losses which, together with all other Losses for which the Stockholder has provided indemnification pursuant to this section 4.8(b), are in excess of the net proceeds received by the Stockholder in the transaction giving rise to such Losses. The Stockholder shall pay each Person entitled to indemnification under this section 4.8 (b) the amount of Losses they incur as they incur a Loss. However, the Stockholder will not need to pay any indemnified Person the amount of (i) Losses that are settlement payments if such indemnified Person makes the settlement without the Stockholder's consent or (ii) Losses, in the case of any Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of Registrable Securities or any other Person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, or any constituent partner, member, employee, agent, contractor, officer or director of any such underwriter, in any such case to the extent such Losses arise out of such underwriter's failure to send or give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may be then supplemented or amended, to the Person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities to such Person if such statement or omission was c orrected in such final prospectus.
(c)
Additional Procedures
. Promptly after a Person entitled to indemnification under this section 4.8 receives notice that it might be subject to Losses, such indemnified Person shall notify the indemnifying Person in writing regarding such potential Losses. The indemnifying Person will have the right to participate in, and, jointly with any other indemnifying Person, to assume the defense against such Losses with one counsel selected by the indemnifying Person, subject to the consent of the indemnified Person (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). If a conflict of interest exists or develops that would prohibit one co unsel from representing both the indemnifying Person and the indemnified Person, then the indemnified Person (together with all other indemnified Persons that one counsel can represent without a conflict of interest) will have the right to retain one separate counsel of their own choosing, with the indemnifying Person paying all the fees and expenses. Except in the event of a conflict of interest, if the indemnifying Person notifies the indemnified Person that it has elected, and then promptly begins, to defend the indemnified Person against Losses, the indemnifying Person will not be liable to such indemnified Person for any legal expenses such indemnified Person subsequently incurs in connection with such defense. If the indemnifying Person elects to assume the defense against any Losses, the indemnifying Person shall allow the indemnified Person to continue to participate in defending against such Losses (at the expense of the indemnified Person) if the indemnified Person so chooses. The indemnified Perso n's failure to notify the indemnifying Person within a reasonable time regarding Losses will not relieve the indemnifying Person of any liability to the indemnified Person under this section 4.8 except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the indemnifying Person's ability to defend against such Losses. In defending against Losses, an indemnifying Person shall not consent to entry of any judgment regarding, or otherwise settle, any claim involving Losses unless (i) the indemnified Person has approved in writing the judgment or other settlement or (ii) the judgment or other settlement includes the claimant's unconditional release of the indemnified Person from all liability related to the subject matter of that claim.
(d)
Unavailability
. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the indemnification under this section 4.8 is unavailable to an indemnified Person with respect to any Losses, then the indemnifying Person, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified Person, shall contribute to the amount the indemnified Person must pay in connection with such Losses the appropriate proportion to reflect the indemnifying Person's relative fault in connection with such Losses. The indemnifying and indemnified Persons shall determine the indemnifying Person's and indemnified Person's relative fault based on, among other things, which Person supplied information relating to the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact and the Person's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e)
Conflict With Underwriting Agreement
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 4.8, to the extent (but only to the extent) that the underwriting agreement's provisions on indemnification and contribution conflict with the provisions of this section 4.8, the underwriting agreement's provisions will control.
(f)
Survival
. The Company's and the Stockholder's obligations under this section 4.8 will survive (i) the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement under this Agreement and (ii) this Agreement's termination.
4.9
Rule 144
. The Company covenants that it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of the Stockholder, make publicly available other non-confidential information so long as necessary to permit sales under Rule 144 under the Securities Act), and it will take such other action as the Stockholder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable the Stockholder to sell or hedge Registrable Securities wit hout registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 under the Securities Act or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of the Stockholder, the Company will deliver to the Stockholder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.
4.10
Assignment
. The Stockholder may assign its rights under this Agreement only in connection with a Permitted Transfer pursuant to which the assignee executes a written agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company whereby the assignee agrees to assume all of the obligations of such Stockholder hereunder and to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement other than the terms and conditions of section 2 and section 3, other than section 3.4 and clauses (a) through (c) of section 3.5.
