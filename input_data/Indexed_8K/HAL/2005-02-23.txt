Directors, Employees or agents subject to the trading restrictions set forth in this Policy may, notwithstanding such restrictions, purchase or sell the Company's securities without regard to whether such purchase or sale is within a Window or a Permitted Period or when the Director, Employee or agent has material inside information, if such purchase or sale is made pursuant to a 10b5-1 Plan, which is adopted and administered in compliance with the following:
 
While a 10b5-1 Plan will allow a Director, Employee or agent to purchase or sell securities while in possession of material nonpublic information, such persons remain obligated to observe all other prohibitions on trading on material inside information detailed above.
