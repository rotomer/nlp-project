The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus;
 
 
(ii)
   
The Shares have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; and the Shares conform to the description of the Stock contained in the Prospectus;
 
 
(iii)
   
The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause upon opinions of local counsel and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company and public officials, provided that such counsel shall state that they believe that both the Representatives and they are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates);
 
 
(iv)
   
This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
 
 
(v)
   
To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is the subject that is required to be described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and that is not so described;

Such counsel may also state that they are relying to the extent they deem necessary upon the factual statements of officers and other representatives of the Company.

,
as the case may be, appear on their face to have complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, to the extent applicable; and they have no reason to believe that any of such documents, when such documents became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and

(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder, their respective directors, officers, trustees and employees and each other person, if any, who controls any Underwriter or the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter or the Selling Stockholder may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Pr eliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter and the Selling Stockholder for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or the Selling Stockholder, as the case may be, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred;
provided, however
, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein or by the Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the preparation of the answers therein to Item 7 of Form S-3;
 
 
(b)
   
The Selling Stockholder will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and the Company, their respective directors, officers and employees and each other person, if any, who controls any Underwriter or the Company within the meaning of the Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter or the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, th e Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the preparation of the answers therein to Item 7 of Form S-3; and will reimburse each Underwriter and the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or the Company, as the case may be, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred;
provided, however
, that in no event shall the Selling Stockholder be liable pursuant to this Section 8(b) for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities which, together with all other losses, claims, damages or liabilities for which the Selling Stockholder has provided indemnification pursuant to this Section 8(b), are in excess of the net proceeds received by the Selling Stockholder in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and provided, further
, that Selling Stockholder shall not be liable to any Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (b) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or lia bility of such Underwriter results from the fact that such Underwriter sold Shares to a person as to whom it shall be established that there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus in any case where such delivery is required by the Act if such Underwriter failed to make reasonable efforts generally consistent with the then prevailing industry practice and the Company has previously furnished copies thereof in sufficient quantity and on a timely basis to such Underwriter and the loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus which was identified in writing at such time to such Underwriter and corrected in the Prospectus.
 
 
(c)
   
Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Selling Stockholder, their respective directors, officers, trustees and employees and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or the Selling Stockholder may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statem ent or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Selling Stockholder for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or the Selling Stockholder in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
 
(d)
   
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof , the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which ind emnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
 
(e)
   
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (d) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Nothing in the foregoing is intended to, or shall, supersede the respective contribution obligations of the Company and the Selling Stockholder, but only as between themselves, provided in Section 4.8(d) of the Stockholder Agreement. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Sel ling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling Stockholder or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by
pro rata
allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damag es which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), the Selling Stockholder shall not be required to contribute an amount in excess of the amount for which it would have been liable if the provisions of subsection (b) above had been available.
 
 
(f)
   
The obligations of the Company and the Selling Stockholder under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Selling Stockholder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company, to each trustee of the Selling Stockholder and to each person, if any, w ho controls the Company or the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the Act.
 
  
9.
   
(a)
   
If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Shares which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for the Representatives or another party or other parties to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Selling Stockholder shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Selling Stockholder that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Selling Stockholder notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, the Representatives or the Selling Stockholder shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives' opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person subst ituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Shares.
 
 
(b)
   
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Selling Stockholder as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Shares, then the Selling Stockholder shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Shares wh ich such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
 
(c)
   
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Selling Stockholder as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all of the Shares, or if the Selling Stockholder shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter o r the Company or the Selling Stockholder, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
 
10.
   
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, of the Selling Stockholder and of the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, or any trustee of the Selling Stockholder, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
 
 
11.
   
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, neither the Company nor the Selling Stockholder shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, (i) if the Shares are not delivered by the Selling Stockholder as provided herein due to a default by the Selling Stockholder of its obligations hereunder, the Selling Stockholder will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives, or (ii) if for any other reason the Shares are not delivered as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all reasonable out-o f-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares, but the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
 
 
12.
   
In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly or by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, as the Representatives; and in all dealings with the Selling Stockholder hereunder, the Representatives and the Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of the Selling Stockholder made or given by the managing trustee of the Selling Stockholder.

No purchaser of any of the Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
