Changes in Registrants Certifying Accountant
 
  (a) Former Principal Independent Accountant. On January 12, 2005, the Halliburton Savings Plan (the Plan) dismissed KPMG LLP (KPMG) as the principal independent accountant auditing the Plans financial statements. The audit reports of KPMG on the Plans financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
The Plans Benefits Committee approved the change in the principal independent accountant for the Plan.    
      
In connection with the audits of the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the subsequent period through January 12, 2005, there were no disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused them to make reference in their opinions to the subject matter of the disagreement. In addition, none of the reportable events described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K occurred with respect to the Plan during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the subsequent period through January 12, 2005.
          (b) New Principal Independent Accountant. On February 3, 2005, after considering proposals received, the Plan engaged Harper & Pearson Company, P.C. (Harper Pearson) as the principal independent accountant for 2004 for the Plan.
          During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the subsequent period through February 3, 2005, neither the Plan nor anyone acting on the Plans behalf consulted Harper Pearson regarding (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Plans financial statements; or (2) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

Halliburton Savings Plan (the Plan) and, under the date of June 25, 2004, we reported on the financial statements and supplemental schedule of the Plan as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the years then ended. On January 12, 2005, our appointment as principal accountants for the Plan was terminated. We have read the Plans statements included under Item 4.01 of its Form 8-K dated March 3, 2006, and we agree with such statements except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with the Plans statements that (i) the change was approved by the Plans Benefits Committee, or (ii) the statements in Item 4.01 (b).
Very truly yours,
