TENTH: The Corporation is hereby authorized to, and shall, indemnify directors, officers and employees of the Corporation and such other parties as are set forth below in accordance with the following provisions:
(a)
 
The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
(b)
 
The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(c)
 
To the extent that any such person referred to hereinabove has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b), or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
(d)
 
Except in those instances where the provisions of subsection (c) of this Article are applicable, or unless ordered by a court, any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of such person referred to hereinabove is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this Article. Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Stockholders.
(e)
 
Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
(f)
 
The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person referred to hereinabove may be entitled under any By-law, agreement, vote of the Stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to act in any capacity hereinabove named in this Article and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(g)
 
The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other power to indemnify or right to indemnification which the Corporation or any person referred to hereinabove may have or acquire under the laws of the State of Delaware including without limitation the General Corporation Law of Delaware or any amendment thereto or substitute therefor.
(h)
 
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to claims, actions, suits or other proceedings referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this Article made or commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from conduct or act or omission occurring before or after the adoption hereof.
ELEVENTH: Both Stockholders and Directors shall have power, if the By-laws so provide, to hold their meeting either within or without the State of Delaware and to keep the books of this Corporation (subject to the provisions of the Statutes) outside of the State of Delaware at such places as may be from time to time designated in the By-laws.
TWELFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the power conferred by statute, the Board of Directors of this Corporation are expressly authorized to fix the amount to be reserved as working capital, to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon the real and personal property belonging to it.
THIRTEENTH: This Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute and all rights conferred on Stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
FOURTEENTH: No holder of any class of stock of this Corporation shall have any preemptive or preferential right of subscription or purchase with reference to the issuance or sale of any class of stock of the Corporation whether now or hereafter authorized, or of any securities or obligations convertible into or carrying or evidencing any right to purchase any class of stock of the Corporation whether now or hereafter authorized.
FIFTEENTH: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any stockholder for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty by such director as a director; except for any matter in respect of which such director shall be liable under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or any amendment thereto or successor provision thereof or shall be liable by reason that, in addition to any and all other requirements for such liability, such director (i) shall have breached the duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) in acting or failing to act, shall not have acted in good faith or shall have acted in a manner involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or (iii) shall have derived an improper personal benefit. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article FIFTEENTH shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article FIFTEENTH in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article FIFTEENTH, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment or repeal. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article FIFTEENTH to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended from time to time.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been executed on behalf of the Corporation by its Senior Vice President and Secretary this 25th day of May, 2006.
