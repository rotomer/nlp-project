WHEREAS
, the Company has purchased and presently maintains a policy or policies of directors and officers liability insurance (D&O Insurance) covering certain liabilities which may be incurred by the directors and officers of the Company in the performance of their services for the Company; and
WHEREAS
, developments with respect to the provisions of D&O Insurance and with respect to the application, amendment and enforcement of statutory, charter and bylaw indemnification provisions generally have raised questions concerning the adequacy and reliability of the protection accorded to officers thereby and may increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified persons to serve as officers of the Company; and
WHEREAS
, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that difficulties relating to the attraction and retention of such persons would be detrimental to the best interests of the Company and of its stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of indemnification protection in the future; and
WHEREAS
, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the By-laws of the Company provide that they are not exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and its officers with respect to indemnification of such officers; and
WHEREAS
, in order to lessen or alleviate the aforementioned concerns and thereby induce Officer to serve and to continue to serve as a corporate officer and an executive officer of the Company, the Company has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Agreement with Officer;
WHEREAS
, in consideration of the above premises and of the covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
 
1.             .  The Company shall indemnify and advance Expenses (as hereinafter defined) to Officer to the fullest extent, and only to the extent, permitted by applicable law in effect on the date hereof and to such greater extent as applicable law may thereafter from time to time permit.  The rights of Officer provided under the preceding sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the rights set forth in the other Sections of this Agreement.
Indemnification - General
2.               Officer shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section 2 if, by reason of Officers Corporate Status (as hereinafter defined), Officer is, or is threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding (as hereinafter defined), other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company.  Pursuant to this Section 2, Officer shall be indemnified against Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Officer or on Officers behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Officer acted in good faith and in a manner Officer reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe Officers conduct was unlawful.
Proceedings Other than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company.
3.             .  Officer shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section 3, if, by reason of Officers Corporate Status, Officer is, or is threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor.  Pursuant to this Section 3, Officer shall be indemnified against Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Officer or on Officers behalf in connection with such Proceeding if Officer acted in good faith and in a manner Officer reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company.

Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company
4.             .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Officer is, by reason of Officers Corporate Status, a party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, Officer shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Officer or on Officers behalf in connection therewith.

For the purposes of this Section 4 and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.
Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful
5.             .  In the event that the indemnity contained in Sections 2, 3 or 4 of this Agreement is unavailable or insufficient to hold Officer harmless in a Proceeding described therein, then in accordance with the non-exclusivity provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and the By-laws of the Company, and separate from and in addition to, the indemnity provided elsewhere herein, the Company shall contribute to Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Officer in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative benefits received by, and fault of, the Company on the one hand and Officer on the other in the acts, transactions or matters to which the Proceeding relates and other equitable considerations.

Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
 
(a)           To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Officer shall submit to the Company a written request, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Officer and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Officer is entitled to indemnification.  The determination of Officers entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than 90 days after receipt by the Company of the written request for indemnification.  The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that Officer has requested indemnification.
(b)           Officers entitlement to indemnification or contribution under any of Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this Agreement shall be determined in the specific case: (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board consisting of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined); (ii) by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), in a written opinion if a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs; or (iii) by the stockholders of the Company.  If, with regard to Section 5 of this Agreement, such a determination is not permitted by law or if a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, such determination shall be made by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which the Proceeding giving rise to the claim for indemnification is brought.
(c)           In the event that the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 6(b) of this Agreement, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 6(c).  The Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors, and the Company shall give written notice to Officer advising Officer of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected.  Officer may, within 7 days after receipt of such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company a written objection to such selection.  Such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of Independent Counsel as defined in Section 13 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion.  If such written objection is made, the Independent Counsel so selected shall be disqualified from acting as such.  If, within 20 days after submission by Officer of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 6(a) of this Agreement, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected, or if selected shall have been objected to, in accordance with this Section 6(c), either the Company or Officer may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by such court or by such other person as such court shall designate, and the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 6(b) of this Agreement, and the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this Section 6(c), regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed.
7.             .  The Company shall advance all reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Officer in connection with any Proceeding within 20 days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Officer requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding.  Officer shall, and hereby undertakes to, repay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Officer is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.
Advancement of Expenses
8.             .  The termination of any proceeding described in any of Sections 2, 3 or 4 of this Agreement, or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Officer to indemnification or create a presumption that Officer did not act in good faith and in a manner which Officer reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Officer had reasonable cause to believe that Officers conduct was unlawful.
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings
9.             .

Officer shall have the right to employ its counsel in such Proceeding but the fees and Expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Officer unless (i) the employment of counsel by Officer has been authorized by the Company, or (ii) Officer shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Officer in the conduct of the defense of such Proceeding, or (iii) the Company shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, in each of which cases the fees and Expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company.  The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which Officer shall have made the conclusion provided for in (ii) above.
(b)           The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Officer under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding or claim effected without its written consent.  The Company shall not settle any Proceeding or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on Officer without Officers written consent.
