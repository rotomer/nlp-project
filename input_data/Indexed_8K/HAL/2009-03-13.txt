     On March 10, 2009, Halliburton Company (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), in connection with the offer and sale of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.15% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.45% Senior Notes due 2039 (the "2039 Notes" and, together with the 2019 Notes, the "Notes"). A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is attached as an exhibit to this filing and incorporated by reference herein. The description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement.
     The Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated as of October 17, 2003 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented with respect to the Notes by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), dated as of March 13, 2009, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee to JPMorgan Chase Bank. The Base Indenture is incorporated by reference herein. A copy of the Supplemental Indenture is attached as an exhibit to this filing and incorporated by reference herein.
     The Company will pay interest on the Notes of each series on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2009. The 2019 Notes will mature on September 15, 2019, and the 2039 Notes will mature on September 15, 2039. The Company may redeem some of the Notes of each series from time to time or all of the Notes of each series at any time at the redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, as set forth in the Supplemental Indenture. The Notes are the Company's general, senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Notes will effectively rank junior to any future secured indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, unless and to the extent the Notes are entitled to be equally and ratably secured.
     The offering of the Notes was made pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-149368) of the Company (the "Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement was automatically effective upon acceptance by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 25, 2008. Certain terms of the Notes and the Indenture are further described in the prospectus dated February 22, 2008, together with the prospectus supplement dated March 10, 2009 filed with the SEC on March 11, 2009 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, which description is incorporated by reference herein.

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or the circumstances then prevailing not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
          (d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus or file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus in order to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of any such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first and second sentences of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.

The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
          (g) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
 
          (h) The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto and any electronic road show. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

(including filing fees and the fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters relating to such filings); (vii) the transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of Company representatives in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Securities, including road show expenses; (viii) the fees and expenses of the Company's accountants and the fees and expenses of counsel (including local and special counsel) for the Company; (ix) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (x) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; and (xi) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 7 and 8 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.

     (b) The Company shall have requested and caused Baker Botts L.L.P., counsel for the Company, to have furnished to the Representatives their opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Underwriters, to the effect that:
     (i) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act; to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened, and the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained therein, as to
 
which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;

     (iii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium, and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;

     (vii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
     (viii) Although the discussion set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders," does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Securities, in such counsel's opinion, such discussion constitutes in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Securities by the holders addressed therein based upon current law and subject to the qualifications set forth therein;

     Such counsel shall also include, in a separate paragraph of its opinion, statements to the following effect: such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, and representatives of KPMG LLP, and with representatives of and counsel to the Underwriters at which the contents of the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and related matters were discussed, and, although such counsel did not independently verify such information, and is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (except to the extent stated in clauses (v) and (viii) above), on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that lead them to believe that (i) as of the Execution Time, the Registration
 
Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) the Final Prospectus, as of its date and on the Closing Date, included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case, other than the financial statements, the notes thereto and the auditor's report thereon and other financial information contained therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion); or (iii) the Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented at the Execution Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements, the notes thereto and the auditor's report thereon and other financial information contained therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion).
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) shall also include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
     (c) Bruce A. Metzinger, Assistant Secretary and Assistant General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives a written opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Underwriters, to the effect that:
     (i) Each Material Subsidiary has been duly formed and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, and each of the Company and each Material Subsidiary has been duly qualified to do business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, other than where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing could not have a Material Adverse Effect; and all of the issued ownership interests of each Material Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued in accordance with the organizational documents of such Material Subsidiary, are fully paid and non-assessable, if applicable, and (except for directors' qualifying shares, if applicable) the ownership interests of each Material Subsidiary owned by the Company directly or indirectly are owned, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims, except as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause upon opinions of local counsel and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company and public officials, provided that such counsel shall state that they believe that both you and they are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates);
 
     (ii) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated (a) will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company or any such subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any such subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any such subsidiary is subject, which conflict, breach violation or default would individually, or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, (b) will not result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, each as amended to date, and (c) will not result in any violation of any statute, any rule, regulation or order of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their properties, which violation of any such statute, order or regulation would individually, or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect;
     (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Material Subsidiaries is in violation of its organizational or governing documents or, except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, is in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound;
     (iv) Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, to such counsel's knowledge, no legal or governmental proceedings are pending, threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or pending or threatened by others against the Company or any of its subsidiaries which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, such counsel expresses no opinion with respect to any pending, threatened or contemplated proceedings under the FCPA or analogous applicable foreign statutes and regulations, in either case of the nature described under the caption "Risk FactorsForeign Corrupt Practices Act Investigations" of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008; and
     (v) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Execution Time (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, appear on their face to have complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or
 
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, to the extent applicable; and they have no reason to believe that any of such documents, when such documents became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading.
     Such counsel may state that the opinions expressed are limited in all respects to the federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of Texas and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, all as in effect on the date thereof. Further, such counsel may state that such counsel expresses no opinion with respect to the Act, or the Exchange Act (except to the extent stated in clause (v) above), or as to any consent, approval, authorization, statute, order, rule or regulation of any governmental agency or regulatory body as may be required under any state securities or "blue-sky" laws.
     (d) The Representatives shall have received from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Underwriters, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
     (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the President or any Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus and any supplements or amendments thereto, as well as each electronic road show used in connection with the offering of the Securities, and this Agreement and that:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its
 
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
     (f) The Company shall have requested and caused KPMG LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters addressed to the Underwriters, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in Annex B hereto.
     (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
     (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.

          7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on demand for all expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been reasonably incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
          8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
          (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities, (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities and (iii) the seventh and eighth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in
 
writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
provided
however
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter
provided
however
 
(except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and that the Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. The amount paid or payable by any indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in this paragraph (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

Halliburton Company 1401 McKinney, Suite 2400 Houston, Texas 77010
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          In connection with the issuance by Halliburton Company, a Delaware corporation ("Halliburton"), of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.15% Notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7.45% Notes due 2039 (together with the 2019 Notes, the "Notes"), pursuant to (a) the Registration Statement of Halliburton on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-149368) (the "Registration Statement"), which was filed by Halliburton with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and (b) the related prospectus dated February 22, 2008, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement relating to the sale of the Notes dated March 10, 2009 (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"), as filed by Halliburton with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, certain legal matters with respect to the Notes are being passed upon for you by us. At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you for filing as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report of Halliburton on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on the date hereof (the "Form 8-K").
          The Notes are to be issued and the terms of the Notes of each series are to be established pursuant to the Indenture, dated October 17, 2003, between Halliburton and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of the date hereof (as so supplemented, the "Indenture").
          In our capacity as your counsel in the connection referred to above, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of (i) the Underwriting Agreement, dated March 10, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among Halliburton and the several Underwriters named in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), relating to the issuance and sale of the Notes; (ii) the Indenture, (iii) the global notes representing the Securities, (iv) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, (v) Halliburton's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, in each case as amended to date, (vi) corporate records of Halliburton, including certain resolutions of the Board of Directors of Halliburton as furnished to us by Halliburton, and (vii) certificates of public officials and of representatives of Halliburton, statutes and other instruments and documents as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In giving such opinions, we have relied upon certificates, statements or other representations of officers or authorized agents of Halliburton and of governmental and public officials with respect to the accuracy of the material factual matters contained therein or covered thereby. We have assumed that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, all
 
documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and complete, that all documents submitted to us as copies are true and correct copies of the originals thereof and that all information submitted to us was accurate and complete. We also have assumed that the Notes of each series will be issued and sold in the manner set forth in the Prospectus.
          On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes will, when duly executed, issued and delivered by Halliburton and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes and when duly purchased and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Halliburton, enforceable against Halliburton in accordance with their terms, except as that enforcement is subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          The opinions set forth above are limited in all respects to matters of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the contract law of the State of New York and federal law of the United States, each as in effect on the date hereof. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.1 to the Form 8-K. We also consent to the reference to our Firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
