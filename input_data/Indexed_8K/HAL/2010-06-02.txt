     In connection with the Halliburton Company conference call hosted by Credit Suisse and scheduled to occur today, Halliburton is disclosing the following that is expected to be discussed during the call:
With respect to the status of well control activities relating to the Macondo well:
Halliburton is assessing its plans in light of the Gulf of Mexico incident relating to the Deepwater Horizon and the prospective regulatory response, including new Minerals Management Service ("MMS") rules. Halliburton is engaged in discussions with its customers and anticipates relocating equipment and personnel to other markets as appropriate. In this connection, Halliburton expects that Gulf of Mexico deepwater activity may be in hiatus for at least six months and possibly longer, although there is potential for continuing operations in the Gulf of Mexico under the current MMS rules, both as to shallow water operations and certain well activities such as water injection and workover operations.
With respect to Halliburton's business in the Gulf of Mexico:
Halliburton believes that it has performed all work with respect to the well that was being drilled by the Deepwater Horizon in accordance with the well owner's instructions and that the applicable contracts provide for full indemnification of Halliburton for all potential claims and expenses (other than claims by Halliburton's employees and with respect to loss or damage to Halliburton's property). In addition, Halliburton has a general liability insurance program of $600 million subject to retention and other costs of $7 million.
NOTE: The statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K that are not historical statements, including statements regarding target dates for relief wells, anticipated regulations, drilling and drilling services activities in the Gulf of Mexico, and Halliburton's plans in the Gulf of Mexico and possible international implications are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Halliburton's control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: results of litigation and investigations; actions by third parties, including governmental agencies; changes in the demand for or price of oil and/or natural gas which has been significantly impacted by the worldwide recession and by the worldwide financial and credit crisis; consequences of audits and investigations by domestic and foreign government agencies and legislative bodies and related publicity, potential adverse proceedings
 
by such agencies; indemnification and insurance matters; protection of intellectual property rights; compliance with environmental laws; changes in government regulations and regulatory requirements, particularly those related to offshore oil and gas exploration, radioactive sources, explosives, chemicals, hydraulic fracturing services and climate-related initiatives; compliance with laws related to income taxes and assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income; risks of international operations, including risks relating to unsettled political conditions, war, the effects of terrorism, foreign operations, and foreign exchange rates and controls, and doing business with national oil companies; weather-related issues, including the effects of hurricanes and tropical storms; changes in capital spending by customers; delays or failures by customers to make payments owed to us; execution of long-term, fixed-price contracts; impairment of oil and gas properties; structural changes in the oil and natural gas industry; maintaining a highly skilled workforce; availability of raw materials; and integration of acquired businesses and operations of joint ventures. Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2010, recent Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings discuss some of the important risk factors identified that may affect Halliburton's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Halliburton undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
