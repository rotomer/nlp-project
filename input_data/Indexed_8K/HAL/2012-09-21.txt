ARTICLE 5:  POST-EMPLOYMENT COVENANTS
 
5.1           In consideration of the access to the Confidential Information (as described in Article 4) provided by Employer, and in consideration of the payment made under Section 3.4(ii) to protect Employers Confidential Information, and the goodwill, customer base, and contractual relationships of Employer, Employee agrees to the provisions of Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4.  Employee further agrees that the provisions in Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4, and the provisions in Article 4, shall survive the termination of Employees employment regardless of the reason for or circumstances of such termination (and regardless of whether such termination of employment is voluntary or involuntary on Employees part).
 
5.2           Employee agrees that, for a period of two (2) years following the termination of Employees employment for any reason, Employee shall not, anywhere in the world, directly or indirectly, either (a) solicit, encourage, or induce to terminate or reduce its business with Employer, any person or entity who paid or engaged Employer for products and/or services, or who received the benefit of Employers products and/or services, or with whom the Employee had any substantial dealings while Employee was employed by Employer, during the three (3) years preceding the termination of Employees employment, or (b) provide any products and/or services, that compete directly with products and/or services provided, marketed, and/or under development by Employer at any time during the three (3) years preceding the termination of Employees employment, to any person or entity who paid or engaged Employer for products and/or services, or who received the benefit of Employers products and/or services, or with whom the Employee had any substantial dealings while Employee was employed by Employer, during the three (3) years preceding the termination of Employees employment; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions in Section 5.2(b) apply only to those products and/or services of Employer with respect to which the Employee was directly involved or knowledgeable.
 
5.3           Employee further agrees that, for a period of two (2) years following the termination of Employees employment for any reason, Employee shall not, anywhere in the world, solicit, directly or indirectly, or cause or permit others to solicit, directly or indirectly, any Former or Current Employee.  The term  as used in this Section 5.3 shall have the same meaning provided for such term in Section 3.7 above.
solicit
 
5.4           Employee further agrees that, for a period of two (2) years following the termination of Employees employment for any reason, Employee shall not, anywhere in the world, engage, directly or indirectly, either as proprietor, stockholder, partner, officer, member, employee, consultant, or otherwise, in any business, or in any division or unit of a commercially diverse business enterprise listed in Section 3.8(a) above, except as qualified by Section 3.8(b) above.
 
5.5           Employee agrees that (a) the covenants contained in Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 hereof are necessary for the protection of Employers business, goodwill and Confidential Information, and (b) the compensation and other consideration received by Employee, including access to Confidential Information, are based on the parties agreement to such covenants.  Employee represents and warrants that the time, scope of activity and geographic area restricted by Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 are reasonable, especially in view of the worldwide scope of the business operations of Employer and the nature of the Confidential Information, that the enforcement of those restrictions contained in Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 would not be unduly burdensome to or impose any undue hardship on Employee, and that Employee will be able to earn a reasonable living while abiding by such covenants.  Employee agrees that the restraints and provisions of Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 are no greater than necessary, and are as narrowly drafted as reasonably possible, to protect the legitimate interests of Employer, including the Confidential Information of Employer, including without limitation its trade secrets.  Employee irrevocably waives all defenses to the strict enforcement of the covenants contained in Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4, and agrees that the breach or violation, or threat thereof, of the obligations and covenants set forth in any of such Sections shall entitle Employer, as a matter of right, to an injunction without the requirement of a bond, restraining any further or continued breach or violation of said obligations and covenants.  The parties agree and acknowledge that the nature of Employers business, including the locations of its projects, vendors, customers, and potential customers, is global in nature.  Accordingly, the parties expressly agree that the foregoing restrictions on Employee need to be global in territorial scope to adequately protect Employers Confidential Information and goodwill, and that such global territorial restriction is reasonable in view of Employers business, Employees position and responsibilities with Employer, and Employees access to the Confidential Information of Employer.  If the scope of any restriction contained in Sections 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4 is deemed by a court to be broader than reasonable, which the parties agree should not be the case, then such restriction shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and Employee and Employer hereby agree that such scope may be judicially modified accordingly in any proceeding brought to enforce such restriction.
 
5.6           Employee agrees that the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain confidential as between the parties and he shall not disclose them to any other person.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Employee will not respond to or in any way participate in or contribute to any public discussion, notice or other publicity concerning, or in any way relating to, execution of this Agreement or its terms and conditions.  Employee further agrees that he shall not make, directly or indirectly, whether in writing, orally or electronically, any negative, derogatory or other comment that could reasonably be expected to be detrimental to the Halliburton Entities, their business or operations or any of their current or former employees, officers or directors.  The foregoing notwithstanding, Employee may disclose the terms of this Agreement to his immediate family, attorneys and financial advisors provided he informs them of this confidentiality provision and they agree to abide by it.
