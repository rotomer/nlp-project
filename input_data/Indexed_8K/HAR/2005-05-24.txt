Item 1.01.              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
      On May 20, 2005, Harman International Industries, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the Company), entered into an amendment (the Amendment) to its Multi-Currency, Multi-Option Credit Agreement dated as of August 14, 2002 (the Credit Agreement), among JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and arranger, Bank of Nova Scotia, as documentation agent, and the other banks and financial institutions party thereto.
      The Amendment modifies the Credit Agreement to permit the Company, after May 20, 2005, to purchase or repurchase shares of its capital stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100 million.
      JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its affiliates have provided and may in the future provide certain advisory and investment banking services in the ordinary course of business for the Company, for which they receive customary fees and expenses.
      A copy of the Amendment is being filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Credit Agreement will expire in August 2005.  The Company is in discussions to replace the Credit Agreement and presently expects to enter into a new facility prior to June 30, 2005.
