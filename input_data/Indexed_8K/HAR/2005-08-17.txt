FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact:  Greg Henry Harman International Industries, Incorporated 202-393-1101
Washington, D.C.  Harman International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE:  HAR) today announced record results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2005 fiscal year.  Net sales for the quarter were $808.0 million compared to $732.0 million during the same prior year period, an increase of 10 percent.  Net income for the three months was $70.2 million, a 32 percent increase above the $53.0 million earned in the fourth quarter last year.  Earnings per diluted share for the three months were $1.01 versus $0.76 a year ago.
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, net sales were $3.031 billion, an increase of 12 percent compared to $2.711 billion in the prior year.  Net income rose 47 percent to $232.8 million versus $157.9 million.  Earnings per diluted share were $3.31 for the fiscal year compared to $2.27 a year ago.
Automotive net sales for the fiscal year were $2.126 billion versus $1.873 billion in the prior year, an increase of 13 percent.  Automotive operating income was $348.1 million versus $308.9 million last year.  Consumer net sales increased 17 percent to $418.3 million, compared to $356.6 million last year.  Consumer operating income was $26.7 million versus an operating loss of $13.0 million last year.  Professional sales were $487.0 million versus $481.7 million a year ago.  Professional operating income was $45.5 million versus $9.9 million last year.  Professional sales were affected by the elimination of lower margin products during the year.
Dr. Sidney Harman, Executive Chairman, and Bernard Girod, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented:
We achieved record sales and earnings in fiscal 2005 and remain confident that we can carry this momentum into the next fiscal year.  Automotive had a solid year, due in part to the successful launch of a new infotainment system for Audi.  Consumer had an excellent year propelled by our popular multimedia products.  Professional produced strong operating results by concentrating on profitable product lines and investing in new technologies that allow better interaction of products used by audio professionals.
