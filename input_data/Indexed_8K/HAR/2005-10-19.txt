Automotive results reflect the successful launch of the Mercedes-Benz S Class in Europe and sales of Infotainment Systems to Harley-Davidson.  Consumer produced very strong results due to the continued success of our multimedia products.  Professional results were positively influenced by the first installments of the HiQnet protocol.
