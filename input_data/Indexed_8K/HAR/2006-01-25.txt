Washington, D.C.  Harman International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE:  HAR) today announced record results for the second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2005.  Net sales for the quarter were $832.6 million, a 6 percent increase compared to $788.6 million last year, or 12 percent exclusive of foreign currency translation.  Operating income for the three months was $115.9 million, 16 percent higher than the $99.5 million in the second quarter last year.  Exclusive of foreign currency translation, operating income increased 25 percent.  Earnings per diluted share were $1.07 compared to $0.92 a year ago, an increase of 16 percent.  Excluding foreign currency translation, earnings per diluted share increased 25 percent.
For the six months ended December 31, 2005 net sales were $1.587 billion compared to $1.480 billion, an increase of 7 percent.  Exclusive of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 11 percent.  Operating income for the period was $194.1 million, a 20 percent increase versus $161.4 million last year, or 26 percent excluding foreign currency translation.  Earnings per diluted share for the six months were $1.86 compared to $1.40 in the prior year period, an increase of 33 percent.  Excluding foreign currency translation, earnings per diluted share were 39 percent higher.
Automotive sales were $547.6 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2 percent versus the same period last year.  Exclusive of foreign currency translation, Automotive sales would have been 9 percent higher than a year ago.  Our Automotive segment absorbs most of the companys translation exposure.  Consumer sales increased 22 percent to $155.0 million.  Professional sales were $130.0 million, an increase of 5 percent compared to the prior year period. 
Dr. Sidney Harman, Executive Chairman, and Bernard Girod, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented:
We achieved excellent results for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2006.  Despite unfavorable foreign currency translation, each of our three operating groups had a strong first half.  Automotive continues to invest in research and development to fuel the growth of our expanding infotainment business.  Consumer multimedia products continued their vigorous growth. Although hampered by product shortages around the

world, sales increased 144 percent compared to the first six months last year.  Professional did well with a solid array of products linked by the HiQnet protocol.  During the first six months of this fiscal year, we repurchased 1,341,300 shares of our outstanding common stock for $119 million. 
Harman/Becker has been selected by the BMW Group as the supplier to enter into final contract negotiations to develop its next generation infotainment headunit with introduction planned in three to four years.  The development, based on Harman-Beckers scalable platform, has begun and finalization of the development contract is in process.  Harman has also received the award for the 2009 Mercedes-Benz E Class mid-level infotainment system and for its sound system, branded Harman/Kardon.
We look forward to the second half of fiscal 2006 and reiterate our expectation that at current exchange rates, we will earn $3.85 per diluted share for the fiscal year.
