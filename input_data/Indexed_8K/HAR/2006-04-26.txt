Dr. Sidney Harman, Executive Chairman, and Bernard Girod, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented:
We produced solid results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2006.  All three of our operating groups achieved good results while continuing to invest in research and development programs that will support the next phase of the Companys growth.  Automotive continues to develop infotainment systems to satisfy new contract awards that launch in fiscal years 2007, 2008 and beyond.  Consumer is developing new multimedia products and the next generation of home electronic systems.  Professional is building on the foundation laid by the successful introduction of the HiQnet protocol.
Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the Company repatriated $200 million and incurred a $1.1 million tax charge in the second quarter.  Because we intend to repatriate an additional $300 million in the fourth quarter, a tax charge of $1.7 million was booked in the third quarter.  Further, the Company is evaluating whether to retire its outstanding bonds prior to maturity in order to obtain the benefit of the substantial interest expense reduction.  We look forward to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and reiterate our expectation of earning $3.85 per diluted share for the full year.
Subject to Board approval, Douglas Pertz will join the Company as President and CEO on May 1, 2006.  He will succeed Bernard Girod who will continue with the Company through the calendar year.
