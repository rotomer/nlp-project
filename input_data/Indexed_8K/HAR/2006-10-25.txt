Harman International PRESS RELEASE
Washington, D.C.  October 25, 2006 - Harman International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE:  HAR) today announced record results for the first quarter ended September 30, 2006.  Net sales for the three months were $825.5 million, a 9 percent increase compared to last year.  Operating income for the quarter increased 11 percent to $86.9 million.  Earnings per diluted share were $0.85 compared to $0.79 during the same period last year, an increase of 8 percent.
Automotive sales for the first quarter were $601.0 million, an increase of 16 percent versus the same period a year ago.  Professional sales increased 7 percent to $131.4 million.  Consumer sales were $93.1 million compared to $111.4 million during the same quarter last year.
Dr. Sidney Harman, Executive Chairman, and Bernard Girod, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented:
We achieved record results during the first quarter of fiscal 2007.  Automotive performed very well while continuing to make substantial investments in infotainment systems development.  Professionals strong quarter is indicative of increasing market acceptance of the new products integrating the HiQnet protocol.  First quarter results for the Consumer Group were below expectations.  However, we expect the group to return to solid profitability in the second quarter.
We reiterate our expectation for earnings of $4.35 per diluted share in fiscal 2007.
