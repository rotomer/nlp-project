PRESS RELEASE
Washington, D.C. - January 25, 2007 - Harman International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE: HAR) today announced record results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006. Net sales for the second quarter were $931.7 million, an increase of 12 percent above the same quarter last year. Net income also increased 12 percent to $81.4 million for the quarter. Earnings per diluted share were $1.22 compared to $1.07 during the same period last year, an increase of 14 percent.
For the six months ended December 31, 2006, net sales increased 11 percent to $1.757 billion compared to the same prior year period. Net income for the six month period increased 9 percent to $138.0 million. Earnings per diluted share were $2.07 compared to $1.86 last year, an increase of 11 percent.
Automotive sales for the second quarter were $632.3 million, an increase of 15 percent compared to the same period last year. Consumer sales increased 5 percent to $163.0 million and Professional sales were $136.4 million, also an increase of 5 percent above the same quarter a year ago.
Dr. Sidney Harman, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented:
Our second quarter and first half of fiscal 2007 produced record results. Automotive achieved excellent results while making considerable investments in new technologies and newly awarded business. Consumer sales were above last years record quarter but operating profits were burdened by increased competition. Professional continues to deliver solid results while introducing new products that incorporate our HiQnet networking protocol. We continue to expect record results with diluted earnings per share at $4.35 for the year.
