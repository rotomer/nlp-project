We achieved good results in fiscal 2007 and completed the year with a strong balance sheet.  Automotive expanded its Infotainment Systems offerings from luxury to mid-range and entry-level cars.  Professional continues to grow through development of new technologies enabling simplified and centralized control of complex audio systems.  Consumer sales were higher than last year but tremendous competition in the multimedia market had an adverse effect on operating margins.  Our balance sheet was strengthened by repurchasing $129 million of our common stock during the year and reducing debt by $121 million.
 
On April 26, 2007, Harman announced that it had entered into a merger agreement with affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and GS Capital Partners in a transaction valued at approximately $8 billion.  We anticipate completing the transaction during the third or fourth quarter of this calendar year.
