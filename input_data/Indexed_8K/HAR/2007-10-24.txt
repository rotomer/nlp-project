Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     
Note Purchase Agreement
     On October 22, 2007, Harman International Industries, Incorporated (the "Company") entered into a note purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") under which it agreed to sell $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (the "Notes") to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. ("KKR"), GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P. and its related funds, which are sponsored by Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("GSCP"), and two financial institutions, Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank") and HSBC USA, Inc. ("HSBC") (collectively, the "Purchasers"). Concurrently with the purchase of the Notes by Citibank and HSBC, each of them entered into an arrangement with an affiliate of KKR pursuant to which the KKR affiliate will have substantial economic benefit and risk associated with such Notes. The issuance and sale of the Notes was concluded on October 23, 2007.
     The Purchase Agreement provides that KKR has the right to designate a nominee to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") for the Board's consideration. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the designee must be qualified and suitable to serve under all applicable Company policies and guidelines and other regulatory requirements, meet the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and otherwise be acceptable to the Board in its good faith discretion (the "Membership Requirements"). For so long as KKR continues to have ownership rights as to at least $200 million principal amount of the Notes or until the occurrence of other specified events, KKR shall have the right to (i) select a successor designee in the event the designee ceases to serve on the Board provided the Membership Requirements are met and (ii) board observation rights in the event no KKR designee is serving on the Board for any reason.
     The Purchase Agreement also provides, subject to certain exceptions, that (i) the Purchasers are restricted from selling or otherwise transferring the Notes or common stock issued upon conversion of the Notes to non-affiliates for a period of 12 months following the closing and (ii) KKR will comply with the Company's stock trading policies until three months after the KKR designee resigns from or ceases to serve on the Board or KKR waives its rights to propose a designee to the Board.
     The Purchase Agreement also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, each of KKR and GSCP is prohibited from acquiring more than 1% of the Company's voting stock (not including shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes) until the earlier of (i) October 15, 2012 and (ii) three months after it ceases to hold any Notes or common stock issued upon conversion of the Notes. In the case of KKR, the period will be extended until three months after the KKR designee resigns from or ceases to serve on the Board or KKR waives its rights to propose a designee to the Board.
     The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1, and incorporated herein by reference.

Indenture
     The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of October 23, 2007 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes are convertible into cash and, at the Company's option, if applicable, shares of the Company's common stock, based on a conversion rate of 9.6154 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $104 per share) only in certain circumstances as set forth in the Indenture. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances as described in the Indenture.
     Upon conversion, a holder will receive in respect of each $1,000 of principal amount of Notes to be converted for each conversion day in the 20-day conversion reference period one twentieth of (A) an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (i) $1,000 or (ii) the conversion value, determined in the manner set forth in the Indenture and (B) if the conversion value per Note exceeds $1,000, the Company will also deliver, at its election, cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock for the conversion value in excess of $1,000.
     The conversion rate shall not exceed 11.5741 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes on account of adjustments to the conversion rate pursuant to the Indenture, subject to the conversion rate adjustments set forth in the Indenture.
     The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.25% per year payable semiannually in arrears in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2008. The Notes will mature on October 15, 2012.
     The Indenture contains a covenant that prohibits the Company from incurring indebtedness if at the time of incurrence the ratio of the Company's Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Indenture, for the four preceding quarters after giving effect to the incurrence exceeds 3.25 to 1.0. This debt incurrence covenant will remain in effect until the earlier of October 23, 2010 or until the aggregate principal amount of the Notes owned by the Purchasers is less than $200 million.
     If a Change in Control, as defined in the Indenture, occurs and a holder of the Notes elects to convert its Notes in connection with such event, the Company will increase the applicable conversion rate for the Notes surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of the Company's common stock as described in the Indenture. Additionally, in the event of a Fundamental Change, as defined in the Indenture, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
     The Notes will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Notes will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated indebtedness and structurally subordinated in right of payment to all of its subsidiaries' obligations (including secured and unsecured obligations) and effectively subordinated in right of payment to its secured obligations to the extent of the assets securing such obligation.

     If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, has occurred and is continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture, declare the principal amount of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration, to be immediately due and payable. In the case of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the principal amount of the Notes and any unpaid interest accrued thereon through the occurrence of such event shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable.
     The foregoing descriptions of the Indenture and the Notes are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, and the Notes, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to the Indenture, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
     
Registration Rights Agreement
     In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of October 23, 2007, with the Purchasers (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause to become effective within 12 months after the closing of the offering of the Notes, a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the Notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes held by those noteholders who have provided certain information to the Company. The Company will use its reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective until the earlier of (i) such time as all of the securities cease to be Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement); and (ii) January 23, 2012, the date that is five years and three months after the closing.
     The Company will be required to pay additional interest, subject to certain limitations, to the holders of the Notes if it fails to comply with its obligations to register the Notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and, subject to certain limitations, keep the shelf registration statement effective as required under the Registration Rights Agreement. In addition, the Company agreed to assist the Purchasers with up to three distributions of not less than $75 million aggregate principal amount of Notes under the circumstances described in the Registration Rights Agreement. Included within those three distributions, the Company also agreed to assist the Purchasers in distributions of not less than $50 million if the distribution includes all securities held by a Purchaser and its affiliates.

          (c) Every Note that bears or is required under this Section 2.14(c) to bear the Restricted Note Legend or the IAI Note Legend, and any Common Stock that bears or is required under this Section 2.14(c) to bear the Restricted Common Stock Legend or the IAI Common Stock Legend (collectively, the "Restricted Securities") shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in the Restricted Note Legend, the IAI Note Legend, the Restricted Common Stock Legend or the IAI Common Stock Legend, as the case may be, unless such restrictions on transfer shall be waived by written consent of the Company, and the holder of each such Restricted Security, by such Notes holder's acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound by all such restrictions on transfer. As used in this Section 2.14(c), the term "transfer" encompasses any sale, pledge, loan, transfer or other disposition whatsoever of any Restricted Security or any interest therein.
 
     Any certificate evidencing such Note (and all securities issued in exchange therefor or substitution thereof), and any stock certificate representing shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of any Note, shall bear a Restricted Note Legend, IAI Note Legend, Restricted Common Stock Legend or IAI Common Stock Legend, as the case may be, unless such Note or such shares of Common Stock have been sold pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act (and which continues to be effective at the time of such transfer) or pursuant to Rule 144 or any similar provision then in force, or such shares of Common Stock have been issued upon conversion of Notes that have been transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act or pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing, with written notice thereof to the Trustee.
     Any Note (or security issued in exchange or substitution therefor) as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms or as to conditions for removal of the Restricted Note Legend set forth therein have been satisfied may, upon surrender of such Note for exchange to the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.06, be exchanged for a new Note or Notes, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the Restricted Note Legend. If the Restricted Note surrendered for exchange is represented by a Global Note bearing the Restricted Note Legend, the principal amount of the legended Global Note shall be reduced by the appropriate principal amount and the principal amount of a Global Note without the Restricted Note Legend shall be increased by an equal principal amount. If a Global Note without the Restricted Note Legend is not then outstanding, the Company shall execute and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver an unlegended Global Note to the Depositary.
     Any such shares of Common Stock as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms or as to which the conditions for removal of the Restricted Common Stock Legend set forth therein have been satisfied may, upon surrender of the certificates representing such shares of Common Stock for exchange in accordance with the procedures of the transfer agent for the Common Stock, be exchanged for a new certificate or certificates for a like number of shares of Common Stock, which shall not bear the Restricted Common Stock Legend required by this Section 2.14.
          (d) By its acceptance of any Note bearing the Restricted Note Legend or the IAI Note Legend, as the case may be, each Holder of such a Note acknowledges the restrictions on transfer of such Note set forth in this Indenture and in the Restricted Note Legend or the IAI Note Legend, as the case may be, and agrees that it will transfer such Note only as provided in this Indenture and as permitted by applicable law.
          (e) The Registrar shall retain copies of all letters, notices and other written communications received pursuant to Section 2.13 or this Section 2.14. The Company shall have the right to inspect and make copies of all such letters, notices or other written communications at any reasonable time during normal hours of operation of the Registrar upon the giving of reasonable notice to the Registrar.
 
     Section 3.01 .
Repurchase At the Option of the Holder
          (a) If there shall have occurred a Fundamental Change, each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase for Cash all or any portion of such Holder's Notes in integral multiples of $1,000 principal amount on a date selected by the Company (the "Fundamental Change Purchase Date"), which Fundamental Change Purchase Date shall be no later than 35 Trading Days after the occurrence of such Fundamental Change, unless such 35 Trading Days would not provide Holders with at least 20 Trading Days' notice, in which event the Fundamental Change Purchase Date shall be the day that provides the shortest period necessary to provide 20 Trading Days' notice, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Purchase Date (the "Fundamental Change Purchase Price"), subject to satisfaction by or on behalf of the Holder of the requirements set forth in Section 3.01(c); provided that if the Fundamental Change Purchase Date is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Interest Payment Date to which it relates, interest accrued to the Interest Payment Date will be paid to Holders of the Notes as of the preceding Regular Record Date.
     A "Fundamental Change" shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as either of the following events shall occur:
               (i) any "person" or "group", other than the Company, its Subsidiaries or any employee benefits plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries, files, or is required to file, a Schedule 13D or Schedule TO (or any successor schedule, form or report) pursuant to the Exchange Act, disclosing that such person has become the beneficial owner of shares with a majority of the total voting power of the Company's outstanding Voting Securities; unless such beneficial ownership arises solely as a result of a revocable proxy delivered in response to a proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act;
               (ii) the Company consolidates with or merges with or into another person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company), or sells, conveys, transfers, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company) or any person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company) consolidates with or merges with or into the Company, and the outstanding Voting Securities of the Company are reclassified into, converted for or converted into the right to receive any other property or security, provided that none of these circumstances will be a Fundamental Change if Persons that beneficially own the Voting Securities of the Company immediately prior to the transaction own, directly or indirectly, shares with a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding Voting Securities of the surviving or transferee person immediately after the transaction in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Company's Voting Securities immediately prior to the transaction;
 
               (iii) the Company's stockholders or Board of Directors adopts a plan for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or
               (iv) upon the occurrence of a Termination of Trading.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, it will not constitute a Fundamental Change if both (x) at least 90% of the consideration for the Common Stock (excluding Cash payments for fractional shares and Cash payments made in respect of dissenter's appraisal rights and Cash payments of the Required Cash Amounts, if any) in the transaction or transactions otherwise constituting the Fundamental Change consists of common stock traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or approved for trading on an established U.S. system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices, or which will be so traded or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection with such Fundamental Change, and (y) as a result of such transaction or transactions the Notes become convertible solely into such common stock (subject to settlement upon conversion in the manner contemplated by Section 10.01, using the value of such common stock for reference).
          (b) As promptly as practicable following the date the Company publicly announces the Fundamental Change transaction, but in no event less than 20 Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of a Fundamental Change in the case of a Fundamental Change within the control of the Company or of which the Company has at least 30 Trading Days prior notice, the Company shall mail a written notice of Fundamental Change by first-class mail to the Trustee and to each Holder at their addresses shown in the register of the Registrar (and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law). The notice shall include a form of Fundamental Change Purchase Notice to be completed by the Noteholder and shall state:
               (i) briefly, the events causing such Fundamental Change;
               (ii) the anticipated effective date of such Fundamental Change;
 
               (iii) the date by which the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice pursuant to this Section 3.01 must be given;
               (iv) the Fundamental Change Purchase Price;
               (v) the Fundamental Change Purchase Date;
               (vi) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent;
               (vii) the then-current Conversion Rate and any adjustments thereto;
               (viii) that Notes with respect to which a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been given by the Holder may be converted pursuant to Article 10 hereof only if the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been withdrawn in accordance with the terms of this Indenture;
               (ix) briefly, the procedures a Holder must follow to exercise rights under this Section 3.01;
               (x) that Notes must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price;
               (xi) that the Fundamental Change Purchase Price for any Note as to which a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been duly given and not withdrawn, together with any accrued interest payable with respect thereto, will be paid on or prior to the third Trading Day following the later of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date and the time of surrender of such Note;
               (xii) briefly, the conversion rights of the Notes;
               (xiii) the procedures for withdrawing a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice;
               (xiv) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment of such Fundamental Change Purchase Price and interest due, if any, interest on Notes surrendered for purchase will cease to accrue on and after the Fundamental Change Purchase Date; and
               (xv) the CUSIP number of the Notes.
          (c) A Holder may exercise its rights specified in Section 3.01(a) by delivery of a written notice of purchase (a "Fundamental Change Purchase Notice") to the Paying Agent at any time prior to the Close of Business on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, stating:
               (i) the certificate number of the Note which the Holder will deliver to be purchased, if Certificated Notes have been issued, or notice compliant with the relevant DTC procedures if the Notes are not certificated;
 
               (ii) the portion of the principal amount of the Note which the Holder will deliver to be purchased, which portion must be $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof; and
               (iii) that such Note shall be purchased pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in this Article 3.
     The delivery of such Note to the Paying Agent prior to, on or after the Fundamental Change Purchase Date (together with all necessary endorsements) at the offices of the Paying Agent shall be a condition to the receipt by the Holder of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price therefor; provided, however, that such Fundamental Change Purchase Price shall be so paid pursuant to this Section 3.01 only if the Note so delivered to the Paying Agent shall conform in all respects to the description thereof set forth in the related Fundamental Change Purchase Notice.
     The Company shall purchase from the Holder thereof, pursuant to this Section 3.01, a portion of a Note if the principal amount of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to the purchase of all of a Note also apply to the purchase of such portion of such Note.
     Any purchase by the Company contemplated pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.01 shall be consummated by the delivery of the consideration to be received by the Holder (together with accrued and unpaid interest) on or prior to the third Business Day following the later of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date and the time of delivery of the Note to the Paying Agent in accordance with this Section 3.01.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Holder delivering to the Paying Agent the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice contemplated by this Section 3.01(c) shall have the right to withdraw such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice at any time prior to the Close of Business on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal to the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 3.02.
     The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or written withdrawal thereof.
     There shall be no purchase of any Notes pursuant to this Section 3.01 if there has occurred (prior to, on or after, as the case may be, the giving, by the Holders of such Notes, of the required Fundamental Change Purchase Notice) and is continuing an Event of Default (other than a default in the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price). The Paying Agent will promptly return to the respective Holders thereof any Notes (x) with respect to which a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been withdrawn in compliance with this Indenture, or (y) held by it during the continuance of an Event of Default (other than a default in the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price) in which case, upon such return, the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.
 
     Section 3.02 .
Effect of Fundamental Change Purchase Notice
          (a) Upon receipt by the Paying Agent of the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice specified in Section 3.01(c), the Holder of the Note in respect of which such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice was given shall (unless such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice is withdrawn as specified in the following two paragraphs) thereafter be entitled to receive solely the Fundamental Change Purchase Price and any accrued and unpaid interest, with respect to such Note. Such Fundamental Change Purchase Price and interest shall be paid to such Holder, subject to receipt of funds by the Paying Agent, on or prior to the third Business Day following the later of (x) the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, with respect to such Note (provided the conditions in Section 3.01(c) have been satisfied) and (y) the time of delivery of such Note to the Paying Agent by the Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 3.01(c).

               (ii) the principal amount of the Note with respect to which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted, and
               (iii) the principal amount, if any, of such Note which remains subject to the original Fundamental Change Purchase Notice and which has been or will be delivered for purchase by the Company.
     A written notice of withdrawal of a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice may be in the form set forth in the preceding paragraph.
     Section 3.03 .

     Section 3.04 . Any Note which is to be purchased only in part shall be surrendered at the office of the Paying Agent (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Note, without service charge, a new Note or Note, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in exchange for, the portion of the principal amount of the Note so surrendered that is not purchased.

In each case the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its compliance with this paragraph.
          (b) An installment of principal or interest will be considered paid on the date due if the Trustee (or Paying Agent, other than the Company or any Affiliate of the Company) holds on that date money designated for and sufficient to pay the installment.

Acceleration
          (a) If an Event of Default, other than a Bankruptcy Default with respect to the Company, occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, by written notice to the Company (and to the Trustee if the notice is given by the Holders), may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to be immediately due and payable. Upon a declaration of acceleration, such principal and interest will become immediately due and payable. If a Bankruptcy Default occurs with respect to the Company, the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
          (b) The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee may waive all past defaults and rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if:
               (i) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes that have become due solely by the declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived, and
               (ii) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
     Section 6.03 .  If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue, in its own name or as trustee of an express trust, any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or the Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding.
Other Remedies
     Section 6.04 .  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.02, 6.07 and 9.02(b), the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, by notice to
Waiver of Past Defaults
 
the Trustee, waive an existing Default and its consequences. Upon such waiver, the Default will cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured, but no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 6.05 .  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture, that may involve the Trustee in personal liability, or that the Trustee determines in good faith may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of Holders of Notes not joining in the giving of such direction, and may take any other action it deems proper that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of Notes.
Control by Majority
     Section 6.06 .  A Holder may not institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture or the Notes, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy under the Indenture or the Notes, unless:
Limitation on Suits

               (ii) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of the Event of Default in its own name as Trustee under the Indenture;
               (iii) Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any costs, liabilities or expenses to be incurred in compliance with such request;
               (iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
               (v) during such 60-day period, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with such written request.
     Section 6.07 .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the right of a Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal of or interest on its Note on or after the Stated Maturities thereof, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, may not be impaired or affected without the consent of that Holder.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment
     Section 6.08 .  If an Event of Default in payment of principal or interest specified in clause (a) or (b) of Section 6.01 occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust for the whole amount of principal and accrued interest remaining unpaid, together with interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, overdue installments of interest, in each case at the rate specified in the Notes, and
Collection Suit by Trustee
 
such further amount as is sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee hereunder.
     Section 6.09 .  The Trustee may file proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee hereunder) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relating to the Company or its creditors or property, and is entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money, securities or other property payable or deliverable upon conversion or exchange of the Notes or upon any such claims. Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, if the Trustee consents to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agent and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee hereunder. Nothing in the Indenture will be deemed to empower the Trustee to authorize or consent to, or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder, any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
     Section 6.10   If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article, it shall pay out the money and property in the following order:
Priorities
     First: to the Trustee for all amounts due hereunder;
     Second: to Holders for amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and interest on the Notes, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal and interest; and
     Third: to the Company or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.
     The Trustee, upon written notice to the Company, may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before such record date, the Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder and the Company a notice that states the record date, the payment date and the amount to be paid.
     Section 6.11 .  If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted a proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under the Indenture and the proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to the Holder, then, subject to any determination in the proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders will be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders will continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Restoration of Rights and Remedies
 
     Section 6.12 .  In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under the Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit (other than the Trustee) to file an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, against any party litigant (other than the Trustee) in the suit having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by a Holder to enforce payment of principal of or interest on any Note on the respective due dates, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes.
Undertaking for Costs
     Section 6.13 .  No right or remedy conferred or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders under this Indenture is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and all such rights and remedies are, to the extent permitted by law, cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or exercise of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, will not prevent the concurrent assertion or exercise of any other right or remedy.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative
     Section 6.14 .  No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default will impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver
     Section 7.01 . 
General
          (a) The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee are as provided by the Trust Indenture Act and as set forth herein. Whether or not expressly so provided, every provision of the Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee is subject to this Article.
          (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in the Indenture and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations will be read into the Indenture against the Trustee. In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise those rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
          (c) No provision of the Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct.
 
     Section 7.02 .  Subject to Trust Indenture Act Sections 315(a) through (d):
Certain Rights of Trustee

The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document, but, in the case of any document which is specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee pursuant to any provision hereof, the Trustee shall examine the document to determine whether it conforms to the requirements of the Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein). The Trustee, in its discretion, may make further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it sees fit.
          (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both conforming to Section 12.06 and the Trustee will not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the certificate or opinion.
          (c) The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and will not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
          (d) The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.
          (e) The Trustee will not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith that it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers or for any action it takes or omits to take in accordance with the direction of the Holders in accordance with Section 6.05 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under the Indenture.
          (f) The Trustee may consult with counsel, and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel will be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.
          (g) No provision of the Indenture will require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of its rights or powers, unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
          (h) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice or be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or shall have received from the Company or from Holders of Notes evidencing not less than
 
twenty-five percent (25%) of the then outstanding Notes, written notice thereof at its address set forth in Section 12.03 and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.
     Section 7.03 .  The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee.

Individual Rights of Trustee
          (a) "cash transaction" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand; and
          (b) "self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation.
     Section 7.04 .  The Trustee (i) makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of the Indenture or the Notes, (ii) is not accountable for the Company's use or application of the proceeds from the Notes and (iii) is not responsible for any statement in the Notes other than its certificate of authentication.
Trustee's Disclaimer
     Section 7.05 .  If any Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee will send notice of the Default to each Holder within 90 days after it occurs, unless the Default has been cured; provided that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interest of the Holders. Notice to Holders under this Section will be given in the manner and to the extent provided in Trust Indenture Act Section 313(c).
Notice of Default
     Section 7.06 .  Within 60 days after each October 15, beginning with October 15, 2008, the Trustee will mail to each Holder, as provided in Trust Indenture Act Section 313(c), a brief report dated as of such October 15, if required by Trust Indenture Act Section 313(a), and file such reports with each stock exchange upon which its Notes are listed and with the Commission as required by Trust Indenture Act Section 313(d).

Compensation and Indemnity

          (b) The Company will indemnify the Trustee for, and hold it harmless against, any loss or liability or expense incurred by it without negligence or bad faith on its part arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture and its duties under the Indenture and the Notes, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including this Section7.07) and of the Trustee defending itself against any claim or liability and of complying with any process served upon it or any of its officers in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties under the Indenture and the Notes. The Trustee will notify the Company promptly for any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company will not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company will defend the claim and the Trustee will cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company shall not be obligated to pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
          (c) To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee will have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, in its capacity as Trustee, except money or property held in trust to pay principal of, and interest on particular Notes. Such Lien will survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

          (b) The Company may exercise its satisfaction and discharge option with respect to the Notes only if:
               (i) no Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall exist on the date of such deposit;
               (ii) such deposit shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a Default or Event of Default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound; and

     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 7.07 shall survive and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section, the provisions of Section 2.03, Section 2.04, Section 2.05, Section 2.06, Section 2.07, Section 2.12, Section 3.01, Article 5, Article 10 and this Article 8, shall survive and the Company shall be required to make all payments and deliveries required by such Sections or Articles, as the case may be, irrespective of any prior satisfaction and discharge until the Notes have been paid in full.

Repayment to Company

If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 8.02 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.01 until such time as the Trustee or such Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02; provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of the principal amount of or interest on any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive any such payment from the money held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent.

          (v) make any change that adversely affects the Holders' right to require the Company to purchase the Notes in accordance with the terms thereof and this Indenture,
          (vi) impair the right to convert or receive any principal or interest payment with respect to, a Note, or right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment with respect to, or conversion of, the Notes, or
          (vii) make any change in the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes required for amendments or waivers.
 
          (c) It is not necessary for Noteholders to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but is sufficient if their consent approves the substance thereof.
          (d) An amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section will become effective on receipt by the Trustee of written consents from the Holders of the requisite percentage in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company will send to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. The Company will send supplemental indentures to Holders upon request. Any failure of the Company to send such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture or waiver.
     Section 9.03 . 
Effect of Consent
          (a) After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it will bind every Holder unless it is of the type requiring the consent of each Holder affected. If the amendment, supplement or waiver is of the type requiring the consent of each Holder affected, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder that has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note that evidences the same debt as the Note of the consenting Holder.
          (b) If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the Trustee may require the Holder to deliver it to the Trustee so that the Trustee may place an appropriate notation of the changed terms on the Note and return it to the Holder, or exchange it for a new Note that reflects the changed terms. The Trustee may also place an appropriate notation on any Note thereafter authenticated. However, the effectiveness of the amendment, supplement or waiver is not affected by any failure to annotate or exchange Notes in this fashion.
     Section 9.04 The Trustee shall receive, and will be fully protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article is authorized or permitted by the Indenture. If the Trustee has received such an Opinion of Counsel, it shall sign the amendment, supplement or waiver so long as the same does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee. The Trustee may, but is not obligated to, execute any amendment, supplement or waiver that affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Indenture.
Trustee's Rights and Obligations
     Section 9.05 .  Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
Conformity With Trust Indenture Act
     Section 9.06 .  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates may, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid or agreed to be paid to all Holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to
Payments for Consents
 
amend such term or provision within the time period set forth in the solicitation documents relating to the consent, waiver or amendment.
     Section 10.01 . 
Conversion Privilege
          (a) A Holder of a Note may convert such Note at any time on or prior to the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in paragraph 7(a), paragraph 7(b), paragraph 7(c), paragraph 7(d) or paragraph 7(e) of the Notes, subject to the provisions of this Article 10. Except as set forth below under Section 10.11 and Section 10.12, if a Holder surrenders its Notes for conversion, such Holder will receive, in respect of each $1,000 of principal amount of Notes to be converted for each Trading Day in the Conversion Reference Period:
               (i) Cash in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) $50 and (B) the Conversion Value for such day divided by 20 (the "Required Cash Amount"), and
               (ii) if the Conversion Value for such day is greater than $1,000, a number of shares of Common Stock (the "Remaining Shares"), equal to the Daily Share Amount for such day, subject to the right of the Company to deliver Cash in lieu of all or a portion of such Remaining Shares as described below.
          (b) By the Close of Business on the Business Day prior to the first scheduled Trading Day of the applicable Conversion Reference Period, the Company may specify a percentage of the Daily Share Amounts that will be settled in Cash (the "Cash Percentage") and will notify the Noteholder of such Cash Percentage through written notice to the Trustee (the "Cash Percentage Notice"). If the Company elects to specify a Cash Percentage, (x) the amount of Cash that the Company will deliver pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 10.01 in respect of each Trading Day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period will equal the product of: (i) the Cash Percentage, (ii) the Daily Share Amount for such Trading Day, and (iii) the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock for such Trading Day and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable in respect of each Business Day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period (in lieu of the full Daily Share Amount for such Trading Day pursuant to clause (b) above) will be a percentage of the Daily Share Amount equal to 100% minus the Cash Percentage. If the Company does not specify a Cash Percentage by the Close of Business on the Trading Day prior to the first scheduled Trading Day of the applicable Conversion Reference Period, the Company shall settle 100% of the Daily Share Amount for each Trading Day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period with shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that the Company will pay Cash in lieu of
 
fractional shares otherwise issuable upon conversion of such Note, pursuant to Section 10.03 hereof. The Company may, at its option, revoke any Cash Percentage Notice through written notice to the Trustee by the Close of Business on the Business Day prior to the scheduled first Trading Day of the applicable Conversion Reference Period.
          (c) A Holder may convert a portion of the principal amount of a Note if the portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to conversion of all of a Note also apply to conversion of a portion of a Note.
          (d) In the event of a stock split, combination, dividend or any other event resulting in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 or 10.10, during the applicable Conversion Reference Period, appropriate adjustment to the equation for calculating Conversion Value, Daily Share Amount and Remaining Shares shall be made, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
          (e) Notes with respect to which a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been given by the Holder may be converted pursuant to this Article 10 only if the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been withdrawn in accordance with Section 3.02.
          (f) Whenever any event described in paragraph 7(a), paragraph 7(b), paragraph 7(c), paragraph 7(d) or paragraph 7(e) of the Notes shall occur such that the Notes become convertible as provided in this Article 10, the Company shall (x) issue a press release and use its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise publicly disclose this information or (y) promptly deliver, in accordance with Section 12.03, written notice of the convertibility of the Notes to the Trustee and each Noteholder and to the Conversion Agent for the benefit of the Noteholders, which press release, website posting, public disclosure or written notice, as the case may be, shall include:
               (i) a description of such event;
               (ii) a description of the periods during which the Notes shall be convertible as provided in paragraph 7(a), paragraph 7(b), paragraph 7(c), paragraph 7(d) or paragraph 7(e) of the Notes as a result of such event;
               (iii) a statement of whether an adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall take effect in respect of such event pursuant to Section 10.13; and
               (iv) the procedures Noteholders must follow to convert their Notes in accordance with this Article 10, including the name and address of the Conversion Agent.
     Section 10.02 . 
Conversion Procedure
          (a) To convert a Note represented by a Global Note, a Noteholder must convert by book-entry transfer to the Conversion Agent through the facilities of the DTC. To convert a Note that is represented by a Certificated Note, a Noteholder must (1) complete and manually sign
 
a Conversion Notice, a form of which is on the back of the Note, and deliver such Conversion Notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Note to the Conversion Agent, (3) if required by the Conversion Agent, furnish appropriate endorsement and transfer documents, and (4) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes. The Conversion Agent shall, within one (1) Business Day of any Conversion Date, provide notice to the Company, as set forth in Section 12.03, of the occurrence of such Conversion Date.
          (b) As promptly as practicable and in any case within three Trading Days following the end of the Conversion Reference Period applicable to the Notes being converted, the Company shall deliver to the Holder, through the Conversion Agent, the Required Cash Amounts and Remaining Shares, if any (including Cash in lieu of Remaining Shares pursuant to Section 10.01 hereof and Cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 10.03 hereof). The person in whose name the certificate representing any shares is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the last Trading Day of the Conversion Reference Period; provided, however, that no surrender of a Note on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the person or persons entitled to receive the Remaining Shares upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the person or persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the Close of Business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open. Upon conversion of a Note, such person shall no longer be a Holder of such Note.
          (c) No payment or adjustment will be made for dividends on, or other distributions with respect to, any Common Stock except as provided in this Article 10. Upon conversion of a Note, a Noteholder will not receive, except as described below, any separate Cash payment representing accrued interest. Instead, accrued interest will be deemed paid by the Cash and/or shares of common stock, if any, received by the Noteholder upon conversion. Delivery to the Noteholder of such Cash and/or shares of Common Stock will thus be deemed (1) to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of a Note, and (2) to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Note. As a result, upon conversion of a Note, accrued and unpaid interest on such Note is deemed paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited.
          (d) Holders of Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the Close of Business on any Regular Record Date next preceding any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business of such Interest Payment Date will receive the semiannual interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion, and such Notes upon surrender must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of such payment; provided that no such payment need be made (x) in connection with any conversion following the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date, (y) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Purchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date or (z) to the extent of any Defaulted Interest, if any Defaulted Interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Note. The Company shall not be
 
required to convert any Notes that are surrendered for conversion without payment of interest as required by this paragraph.
          (e) If the Holder converts more than one Note at the same time, the Required Cash Amounts and the Remaining Shares, if any (together with the Cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) shall be based on the total principal amount of the Notes converted.
          (f) If the last day on which a Note may be converted is a Legal Holiday, the Note may be surrendered on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday.
          (g) Upon surrender of a Note that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Note in an authorized denomination equal in principal amount to the unconverted portion of the Note surrendered.
     Section 10.03 .  The Company will not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of a Note. Instead, the Company will deliver Cash in lieu of a fractional share based on arithmetic average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of Common Stock for each of the twenty consecutive Trading Days of the Conversion Reference Period, rounded to the nearest whole cent (the "Average Price").
Fractional Shares
     Section 10.04 If a Holder converts a Note, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Company may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Company receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the Common Stock is to be delivered in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
Taxes On Conversion
     Section 10.05 . 
Company To Provide Common Stock
     The Company shall at all times have authorized and reserved and keep available for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the delivery in respect of all outstanding Notes of the number of Remaining Shares due upon conversion, including as may be adjusted for share splits, combinations or other similar transactions (assuming, for purposes of this sentence, that the Company elects to deliver solely shares of Common Stock in respect of its obligation to deliver the Remaining Shares).
     All shares of Common Stock delivered upon payment of the Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon conversion of the Notes shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
     The Company will comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon payment of the Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon
 
conversion of Notes, if any, and will list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common Stock on each national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market or such other market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
     In addition, if any shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority before such shares of Common Stock may be issued upon such conversion, the Company will cause such shares of Common Stock to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be.
     Section 10.06 . 
Adjustment for Change In Capital Stock
          (a) If the Company shall, at any time and from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, issue a dividend or make a distribution on its Common Stock payable in shares of its Common Stock to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate at the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution will be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction:
               (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, plus the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution; and
               (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Ex-Dividend Date.
     If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.06(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.06(a).
          (b) If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, subdivide or reclassify its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and conversely, if the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, combine or reclassify its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately decreased. In each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such subdivision, combination or reclassification and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination. Such increase or reduction, as
 
the case may be, shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day upon which such subdivision, combination or reclassification becomes effective.
     Section 10.07 .  If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while the Notes are outstanding, distribute rights or warrants to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock entitling them, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, to purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution by a fraction:
Adjustment for Rights Issue
     Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
     To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants or upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution had not occurred. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the relevant distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights and the value of such consideration if other than Cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Except as set forth in this paragraph, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.07.
 
     Section 10.08 . 
Adjustment for Other Distributions
          (a) If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while the Notes are outstanding, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any of its Capital Stock, assets, or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company (excluding (x) any distributions described in Section 10.06(a) above, (y) any rights or warrants described in Section 10.07 above and (z) any all-cash dividends or other cash distributions referred to in Section 10.09 below and subject to Section 10.08 (b) below) (such Capital Stock, assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company being distributed hereinafter in this Section 10.08 called the "Distributed Assets"), the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction:
               (i) the numerator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock, and
               (ii) the denominator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock minus the fair market value, as determined by the Board of Directors, of the portion of Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of the Common Stock (determined on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such Ex-Dividend Date).
     Such increase shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared. Except as set forth in the prior sentence, in no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.08.
     If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.08 by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any Distributed Assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the "Reference Period") used in computing the Current Market Price for purposes of clause (i) above, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the fair market value during the Reference Period would not be in the best interest of the Holders.
          (b) With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 10.08 where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction:
               (i) the numerator of which shall be (a) the average of the closing sale prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the five Trading Days commencing on and including
 
the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution on the principal national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which such securities are then listed or traded, plus (b) the average of the Closing Prices over the five Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution (the "Average Sale Price"), and
               (ii) the denominator of which shall be the Average Sale Price.
     Section 10.09 .  If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Notes are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its shares of Common Stock, Cash (excluding (w) any cash dividend on the Common Stock that is the first cash dividend with an Ex-Dividend Date in any calendar quarter to the extent that such cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed $.0125 (each such number, the "Dividend Threshold Amount") (the Dividend Threshold Amount shall be subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, provided that no adjustment will be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10.09), (x) any distributions described in Section 10.10 below or (y) any dividend or distribution in connection with the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up), then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business of the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution by a fraction:
Adjustment for Cash Dividends
     If any adjustment is required to be made as set forth in this Section 10.09 as a result of a distribution that is a quarterly dividend, such adjustment shall be based upon the amount by which such distribution exceeds the Dividend Threshold Amount. If an adjustment is required to be made as set forth in this Section 10.09 above as a result of a distribution that is not a quarterly dividend, such adjustment shall be based upon the full amount of the distribution.
     Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     Section 10.10 .  In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, at any time or from time to time, while any of the Notes are outstanding, distribute Cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or an exchange offer (that is treated as a "tender offer" under U.S. federal securities laws) made by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock, where the sum of the aggregate amount
Adjustment for Certain Tender Offers or Exchange Offers
 
of such Cash distributed and the aggregate fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and set forth in a Board Resolution), as of the Expiration Date (as defined below), of such other consideration distributed (such sum, the "Aggregate Amount") expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged, and not withdrawn, pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer as of the Expiration Time (as defined below) (such tendered or exchanged shares of Common Stock, the "Purchased Shares") exceeds the Closing Price per share of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day immediately following the last date (such last date, the "Expiration Date") on which tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer (as the same may be amended through the Expiration Date), then, and in each case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date by a fraction:
     An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10.10 shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the second Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date. In the event that the Company or a Subsidiary is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this Section 10.10 to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 10.10.
     Section 10.11 .  Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("Trigger Event"): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of Section 10.06, Section 10.07,
Provisions Governing Adjustment to Conversion Rate
 
Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under Section 10.08, except as set forth in Section 10.23. If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, options or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof), except as set forth in Section 10.23. In addition, except as set forth in Section 10.23, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 was made (including any adjustment contemplated in Section 10.23), (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
     Section 10.12 .  If any of the following events (any such event, a "Disposition Event") occurs:
Disposition Events
          (a) any reclassification of the Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination);
          (b) any merger, consolidation or other combination involving the Company; or
          (c) any sale, conveyance, lease, or other disposal of all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Company to any other Person;
in each case, as a result of which all of the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive Cash, securities or other property for their shares of Common Stock, the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture, if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) providing that notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.01, and subject to the provisions of paragraph 7
 
of the Notes, the Conversion Value with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes converted following the effective date of any Disposition Event, shall be calculated based on the kind and amount of Cash, securities or other property (collectively, "Reference Property") received upon the occurrence of such Disposition Event by a holder of Common Stock holding, immediately prior to the transaction, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such Disposition Event; provided that if the Disposition Event provides the holders of Common Stock with the right to receive more than a single type of consideration determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election, the Reference Property shall be comprised of the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock who affirmatively make such election.
     If the Conversion Value of the Notes shall be based on Reference Property as set forth above, the Company's obligation to deliver the consideration described in Section 10.01 with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion after the effective date of any such Disposition Event, shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 10.01, be settled in Cash and units of Reference Property (if applicable) and the Company shall deliver, for each Trading Day in the Conversion Reference Period, as promptly as practicable immediately following the last Trading Day of the Conversion Reference Period an amount in Cash and Reference Property, determined as set forth in Sections 10.01(a) and 10.01(b); that, in each case, (x) the Conversion Value and the Daily Share Amounts, shall be determined as if the words "Volume Weighted Average Price per share of Common Stock" in the definition of each such term were replaced by the words "Volume Weighted Average Price per unit of Reference Property composed of the kind and amount of Cash, securities or other property that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Disposition Event would have owned or been entitled to receive," (y) the Volume Weighted Average Price shall be determined with respect to such a unit of Reference Property and (z) references to "Remaining Shares" and "shares of Common Stock" were instead references to "a unit of Reference Property composed of the kind and amount of Cash, securities or other property that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Disposition Event would have owned or been entitled to receive."
provided
     Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 10. If, in the case of any such Disposition Event, the stock or other securities and assets receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a Person other than the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, in such Disposition Event, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other Person and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Noteholders as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.
     The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at the address of such Noteholder as it appears on the register of the Notes maintained by the Registrar, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
 
     The above provisions of this Section 10.12 shall similarly apply to successive Disposition Events.
     If this Section 10.12 applies to any event or occurrence, none of Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 or Section 10.10 shall apply.
     Section 10.13 .
Adjustment to Conversion Rate Upon Change in Control Transactions, Discretionary Adjustment
          (a) If, after the Issue Date, a Change in Control occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Change in Control, the Company will increase the Conversion Rate for the Notes surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the "Make-Whole Shares"), as described in this Section 10.13. A conversion of Notes will be deemed for the purposes of this Section 10.13 to be "in connection with" a Change in Control transaction if the notice of conversion of the Notes is received by the Conversion Agent from and including the effective date of the closing of the Change in Control transaction up to and including the Trading Day prior to the related Fundamental Change Purchase Date.
          (b) The number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by reference to the table below and is based on the date which such Change in Control transaction becomes effective (the "Change in Control Effective Date") and the price paid per share of Common Stock in the Change in Control (in the case of a Change in Control described in clause (ii) of the definition of Fundamental Change), or in the case of all other Changes in Control, the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock over the five Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day preceding the relevant Change in Control Effective Date (the "Stock Price"). If holders of Common Stock receive only cash in the case of a Change in Control described in clause (ii) of the definition of Fundamental Change, the Stock Price shall be the Cash amount paid per share of Common Stock. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock over the five Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day preceding the relevant Change in Control Effective Date.
          (c) The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. In addition, the number of Make-Whole Shares on the table below will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 10.06 through Section 10.10.
 
          (d) If the exact Stock Prices and Change in Control Effective Dates are not set forth in the table, then: (i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table or the Change in Control Effective Date is between two Change in Control Effective Dates in the table, the Make-Whole Shares issued upon conversion of the Notes will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the earlier and later Change in Control Effective Dates in the table, based on a 365-day year, (ii) if the Stock Price is in excess of $350 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10.13(c), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Notes; and (iii) if the Stock Price is less than $86.40 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10.13(c), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Notes.
          (e) The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Sections 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 and 10.10 as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
          (f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to holders of record of the Notes a notice of the increase at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
     Section 10.14 .  No adjustment in the Conversion Rate need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate. Any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate shall be carried forward and taken into account in determining any subsequent adjustment. In addition, the Company shall make any carry forward adjustments not otherwise effected upon notice of a required purchase of the notes pursuant to Section 3.01, and on July 15, 2012.
When Adjustment May Be Deferred
 
     Section 10.15 . 
When No Adjustment Required
          (a) No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 10.06 or Section 10.07 if Noteholders participate, without conversion, in the transaction or event that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment pursuant to such Section at the same time as holders of the Common Stock participate with respect to such transaction or event and on the same terms as holders of the Common Stock participate with respect to such transaction or event as if Noteholders, at such time, held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate at such time.
          (b) No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest.
          (c) No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.
          (d) To the extent the Notes become convertible pursuant to this Article 10 into Cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the Cash. Interest will not accrue on the Cash.
          (e) The Conversion Rate shall not exceed 11.5741 shares per $1,000 (subject to adjustments at the same time and the same manner as adjustments set forth in Sections 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 and 10.10 above) principal amount of the Notes on account of adjustments to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Article 10.
     Section 10.16 . Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Noteholders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice and a certificate from the Company's independent public accountants briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof.
Notice of Adjustment
     Section 10.17 .  If (a) the Company takes any action that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 or 10.10 (unless no adjustment is to occur pursuant to Section 10.14 or Section 10.15), (b) the Company takes any action that would require a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 10.12, or (c) there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, then the Company shall mail to Noteholders and file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice stating the proposed Ex-Dividend Date for a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, transfer, liquidation or dissolution. The Company shall file and mail the notice at least 15 days before such date; provided that if the Company elects to make a distribution described in Section 10.07, Section 10.08, or Section 10.09, and in the case of Section 10.08 or Section 10.09, that has a per share value equal to more than 10% of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on the day preceding the declaration date for such distribution, the Company shall give notice to Holders at least 20 Trading Days prior to the Ex-
Notice of Certain Transactions
 
dividend Date for such distribution. Failure to file or mail the notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of the transaction.
     Section 10.18 .  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Note shall have the right to convert its Note in accordance with this Article 10 and paragraph 7 of the Notes and to bring an action for the enforcement of any such right to convert, and such rights shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
Right of Holders to Convert
     Section 10.19 .  The Company shall be responsible for making all calculations called for hereunder and under the Notes. These calculations include, but are not limited to, Conversion Value, the Conversion Date, the Volume Weighted Average Price, the Conversion Reference Period, the Closing Price, the Conversion Price, the Required Cash Amounts, the Applicable Conversion Rate and the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, to be issued upon conversion of the Notes. The Company shall make all these calculations in good faith and, absent manifest error, the Company's calculations will be final and binding on Noteholders. The Company shall provide a schedule of the Company's calculations to the Trustee, and the Trustee is entitled to rely upon the accuracy of the Company's calculations without independent verification.
Company Determination Final
     Section 10.20 .  The Trustee has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Article 10 should be made, how it should be made or what it should be. The Trustee has no duty to determine whether a supplemental indenture under Section 10.12 need be entered into or whether any provisions of any supplemental indenture are correct. The Trustee shall not be accountable for and makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of Notes. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the Company's failure to comply with this Article 10. Each Conversion Agent shall have the same protection under this Section 10.20 as the Trustee.
Trustee's Adjustment Disclaimer
     Section 10.21 . 
Simultaneous Adjustments
          (a) For purposes of Section 10.08, Section 10.06(a) and Section 10.07, any dividend or distribution to which Section 10.08 is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the debt securities, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 10.08 with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 10.06(a) and Section 10.07 with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Ex-Dividend Date" within the meaning of Section 10.06(a).
          (b) The reclassification of the Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon an event to which Section 10.12 applies) shall be deemed to involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than the Common
 
Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be the "Ex-Dividend Date" within the meaning of this Section 10.08), and (b) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective," as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of Section 10.06(b)).
     Section 10.22 .  After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Article 10, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Article 10 shall cause an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
Successive Adjustments
     Section 10.23 . 
Rights Issued in Respect of Common Stock Issued Upon Conversion
     In the event the Company adopts or implements a shareholder rights agreement (a "Shareholder Rights Plan") pursuant to which rights ("Rights") are distributed to the holders of Common Stock of the Company and such Shareholder Rights Plan provides that each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Notes at any time prior to the distribution of separate certificates representing such Rights will be entitled to receive such Rights, then there shall not be any adjustment to the conversion privilege or Conversion Rate at any time prior to the distribution of separate certificates representing such Rights. If, however, prior to any conversion, the Rights have separated from the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, its assets, debt securities or rights as described in Section 10.08 above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such Rights.
     Section 10.24 .  The Company may, at its option, set-off withholding taxes due with respect to Notes against payments of Cash and Common Stock on the Notes to the extent required by law. In the case of any such set-off against Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Notes, such Common Stock shall be valued based on the arithmetic average of the Volume Weighted Average Price for each Trading Day in the relevant Conversion Reference Period.
Withholding Taxes for Adjustments in Conversion Rate
     Section 11.01 . Interest on any Note that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any applicable Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the person in whose name that Note is registered at the Close of Business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose. Each installment of interest payable in Cash on any Note shall be paid in same-day funds by transfer to an account maintained by

the payee located inside the United States, if the Trustee shall have received proper wire transfer instructions from such payee not later than the related Regular Record Date or, if no such instructions have been received by check drawn on a bank in the United States mailed to the payee at its address set forth on the Registrar's books. In the case of a Global Note, interest payable on any applicable payment date will be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to the Depositary, with respect to that portion of such Global Note held for its account by Cede & Co. for the purpose of permitting such party to credit the interest received by it in respect of such Global Note to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.
     Section 11.02 .  Except as otherwise specified with respect to the Note, any interest on any Note that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, within 30 days following any applicable payment date (herein called "Defaulted Interest," which term shall include any accrued and unpaid interest that has accrued on such defaulted amount in accordance with paragraph 1 of the Notes), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below.
Defaulted Interest
          (a) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the Close of Business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the proposed payment (which shall not be less than 20 days after such notice is received by the Trustee), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment (the "Special Record Date"). The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Notes at his address as it appears on the list of Noteholders maintained pursuant to Section 2.05 not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the Close of Business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b).
          (b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Notes in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if,
 
after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     Section 11.03 .  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article 11 and Section 2.06, each Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Notes.

Subject to paragraph (d), a Holder may revoke an act as to its Notes, but only if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver or other consequence of the act becomes effective.
          (d) The Company may, but is not obligated to, fix a record date (which need not be within the time limits otherwise prescribed by Trust Indenture Act Section 316(c)) for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to act with respect to any amendment or waiver or in any other regard, except that during the continuance of an Event of Default, only the Trustee may set a record date as to notices of default, any declaration or acceleration or any other remedies or other consequences of the Event of Default. If a record date is fixed, those Persons that were
 
Holders at such record date and only those Persons will be entitled to act, or to revoke any previous act, whether or not those Persons continue to be Holders after the record date. No act will be valid or effective for more than 90 days after the record date.

               (d) Each Holder agrees that if such Holder wishes to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus it will do so only in accordance with Section 2.1(c) and subject to Section 2.5. Each Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement without delivering, or causing to be delivered, a Prospectus (excluding those materials incorporated by reference therein) to the purchaser thereof and, following termination of the Effectiveness Period, to notify the Company, within ten days of a written request by the Company, of the amount of Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and, in the absence of a response within such period, the Company may assume that all of such Holder's Registrable Securities have been so sold.
               (e) The Company agrees that, in the context of a registered Sponsor Supported Distribution, and only for the period of 30 days from the earlier of the public announcement or commencement of marketing efforts with respect to such Sponsor Supported Distribution, unless it obtains the prior consent of the managing Underwriter (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and each Holder agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company, it will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing
 
Prospectus, or that would otherwise constitute a Free Writing Prospectus required to be filed with the SEC. The Company represents that any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus prepared by it or authorized by it in writing for use by such Holder will be delivered to each such Holder and will not include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when taken together with the information in the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     The Company agrees to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement if required by the 1933 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder or by the instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company or, to the extent the Company does not reasonably object, as reasonably requested by the Purchasers with respect to information relating to such Purchasers or by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders covered by such Shelf Registration Statement with respect to information relating to such Holders, and to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after it is used or filed with the SEC.

Each Holder shall pay all underwriting and placement discounts and commissions, agency and placement fees, brokers commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities.
Expenses
          2.3 . After a Shelf Registration Statement is effective, if the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental agency or court, such Shelf Registration Statement will be deemed not to have been effective during the period of such interference, until the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement may legally resume.
Effectiveness
          2.4 . In the event that (a) a Shelf Registration Statement has not become effective by the Shelf Effectiveness Deadline, (b) after the Shelf Registration Statement has become effective, subject to Section 2.5, the Shelf Registration Statement fails to be effective or usable by the Holders (determined as if there were no trading restrictions which the Sponsor Purchasers and their Affiliates are subject to under Section 7.1 of the Purchase Agreement at such time) without being succeeded within seven Business Days by a post-effective amendment or a report filed with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act that cures the failure to be effective or usable or (c) the Shelf Registration Statement is unusable by the Holders for any reason (determined as if there were no trading restrictions which the Sponsor Purchasers and their Affiliates are subject to under Section 7.1 of the Purchase Agreement at such time), and the number of days for which the Shelf Registration Statement shall not be usable (determined as if there were no trading restrictions which the Sponsor Purchasers and their Affiliates are subject to under Section 7.1 of the Purchase Agreement at such time) exceeds any Suspension Period permitted by Section 2.5 hereunder (each such event being a ""), additional interest (""), will accrue on the Notes that are Registrable Securities at a rate per annum of 0.25% of
Interest
Registration Default
Additional Interest
 
the principal amount of the Notes that are Registrable Securities, payable periodically on April 15th and October 15th each year; , , that, in no event shall Additional Interest accrue at a rate per annum exceeding 0.25% of the principal amount of the Notes that are Registrable Securities; that no Additional Interest shall accrue under clauses (b) and (c) above with respect to any Holder that (x) does not deliver to the Company a completed Questionnaire and such other information that the Company may reasonably request, if any, as provided for in Section 2.1(c), and (y) is not named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Additional Interest be payable in connection with a Registration Default relating to a failure to register the Common Stock into which the Notes are convertible; for the avoidance of doubt, if none of the Securities are registered then Additional Interest only will be payable in connection with the Registration Default relating to the failure to register the Notes. Upon the cure of all Registration Defaults then continuing, the accrual of Additional Interest will automatically cease and the interest rate borne by the Notes will revert to the original interest rate at such time. Additional Interest shall be computed based on the actual number of days elapsed in each six-month period between payment dates after the Shelf Effectiveness Deadline in which the Shelf Registration Statement is not effective or is unusable. Holders who have converted Notes into Common Stock will not be entitled to receive any Additional Interest with respect to such Common Stock or the principal amount of the Notes converted.
provided
however
provided further
     The Trustee shall be entitled, but shall not be obligated, on behalf of the Holders of Registrable Securities, to seek any available remedy for the enforcement of this Agreement, including for the payment of any Additional Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the sole monetary damages payable for a violation of the terms of this Agreement with respect to which Additional Interest is expressly provided shall be such Additional Interest. Nothing shall preclude a Holder of Registrable Securities from pursuing or obtaining specific performance or equitable relief with regard to this Agreement. Each obligation to pay Additional Interest shall be deemed to accrue from and including the day following the Registration Default to but excluding the day on which the Registration Default is cured.
     A Registration Default under clause (a) above shall be cured on the date that the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective. A Registration Default under clauses (b) or (c) above shall be cured on the date an amended Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective or the Company otherwise declares the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus useable, as applicable.
     The parties agree that the Additional Interest provided for in this Section 2.4 constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that may be incurred by Holders of Registrable Securities and does not constitute a penalty.
          2.5 . Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company may suspend the use of any Prospectus, without incurring or accruing any obligation to pay Additional Interest pursuant to Section 2.4, for a period not to exceed 90 consecutive calendar days or an aggregate of 120 calendar days in any twelve-month period, as such period may be reduced pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof (each, a ""), if the Company shall have determined in good faith that because of valid business reasons (not including avoidance of the Company's obligations hereunder), including without limitation plans for a registered public offering, an acquisition or other proposed or pending corporate developments and similar events or because of filings with the SEC, it is in the best interests of the Company to suspend such use, and prior to suspending such use the
Suspension
Suspension Period
 
Company provides the Holders with written notice of such suspension, which notice need not specify the nature of the event giving rise to such suspension (and, upon receipt of such notice, each Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder is advised in writing that the Prospectus may be used, which notice the Company agrees to provide promptly following the lapse of the event or circumstances giving rise to such suspension). Each Holder shall keep confidential any communications received by it from the Company regarding the suspension of the use of the Prospectus (including the fact of the suspension), except as required by applicable law.

               (g) use reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement at the earliest practicable moment or, if any such order or suspension is made effective during any Suspension Period, at the earliest practicable moment after the Suspension Period;
               (h) upon the occurrence of any event or the discovery of any facts, each as contemplated by Sections 3(e)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such an event, use reasonable efforts to prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not contain at the time of such delivery any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and, at such time as such public disclosure is otherwise made or the Company determines that such disclosure is not necessary, in each case to correct any misstatement of a material fact or to include any omitted material fact, the Company agrees promptly to notify each Holder that has provided the Questionnaire and the other information required by Section 2.1(c) of such determination and to furnish each Holder such number of copies of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, as such Holder may reasonably request;
               (i) (i) use reasonable efforts to cause the Indenture to be qualified under the 1939 Act in connection with the registration of the Registrable Securities, (ii) cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the 1939 Act, and (iii) execute, and use reasonable efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes, and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner;
               (j) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities to be listed on any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;
 
               (k) make generally available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, earning statements covering at least 12 months (which need not be audited) satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and Rule 158 thereunder; and
               (l) make a reasonable effort to provide such information as is required for any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
     Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.1(c), the Company may (as a condition to such Holder's participation in the Shelf Registration) require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the proposed distribution by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing. Each Holder agrees promptly to furnish to the Company in writing all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not misleading, any other information regarding such Holder and the distribution of such Registrable Securities as may be required to be disclosed in the Prospectus or Shelf Registration Statement under applicable law or pursuant to SEC comments and any information otherwise reasonably required by the Company to comply with applicable law or regulations.
     Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event or the discovery of any facts, each of the kind described in Section 3(e)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(h) or written notice from the Company that the Shelf Registration Statement is again effective and no amendment or supplement is needed, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies in such Holder's possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.
     Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3 to the contrary, any and all obligations (including to provide documents, notices or cooperation) on the part of the Company for the benefit of any Underwriter or Initial Purchaser, or any of their agents or counsel, shall apply only in the context of a Sponsor Supported Distribution.

               (c) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 4 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 4, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (1) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (2) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 4 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel), reasonably approved by the indemnifying party, representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures
provided, however
               (d) . The indemnifying party under this Section 4 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be withheld unreasonably, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the
Settlements
 
foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 4(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 45 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
               (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative fault of the indemnifying parties on the one hand and the indemnified parties and the Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 4. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any reasonable out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, no Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
     No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 4, each director, officer, employee and agent of Holder, or each Person, if any, who controls any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

Distributions by Holders
     (a) Each Purchaser hereby acknowledges the restrictions on the transfer of the Securities as set forth in Section 7 of the Purchase Agreement and expressly acknowledges that such provisions apply to the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Purchaser and its Affiliates.
     (b) If the Company shall at any time receive a written request from Holders then able to participate in a Substantial Distribution that in the aggregate have Beneficial Ownership of at least the Threshold Amount of Registrable Securities (i) that the Company assist in a Substantial Distribution, (ii) stating that such Holders have a current bona fide intent to effectuate a Substantial Distribution and (iii) providing verification that such Holders Beneficially Own at least the Threshold Amount of Registrable Securities, the Company will (x) provide reasonable notice of the request to each Purchaser pursuant to which the Company will offer to include such Purchaser's Registerable Securities in such Substantial Distribution upon a written request from such Purchaser received by the Company within 10 days of such notice (such request to specify the number of such Purchaser's Registerable Securities that such Purchaser requests be included in such Substantial Distribution) and (y) provide such Holders (including such Purchasers that submitted a written request within such ten-day period) with its reasonable cooperation, as requested by such Holders, to facilitate such Substantial Distribution; , , that the Company shall only be required to assist the Holders with an aggregate of three such Substantial Distributions (and the parties agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless GSCP and its Affiliates at any time hold less than $50 million principal amount of Securities and have not previously initiated a request that the Company assist in a Substantial Distribution, the Company shall only be required to assist in two Substantial Distributions initiated at the request of Holders other than GSCP and its Affiliates); , that the Company shall not be required to assist any Holders with a Substantial Distribution more than once in any 270 day period and; , that the Company will only be required to provide Holders with such cooperation until the earlier of consummation of the Sponsor Supported Distribution or 45 days following the earlier of the public announcement or commencement of marketing efforts with respect to such distribution. Under any circumstances and for such periods as the Company would be permitted to initiate a Suspension Period pursuant to Section 2.5, the Company shall have the right to delay the commencement (, the taking of any external activity, but not including internal, non-public preparatory work) of a Sponsor Supported Distribution (a "") for a period of days which, when aggregated with any pending or prior Suspension Periods and Delay Periods, would not exceed the 90 and 120 day limits set forth in Section 2.5 without, in the context of a registered Sponsor Supported Distribution, formally initiating

In addition, under no circumstances shall the Company be required to commence a Sponsor Supported Distribution at any time during the three week period immediately preceding the scheduled public disclosure of results for any quarter (the "") and any delay during that time shall not be counted against the Suspension Period. If a request for a Sponsor Supported Distribution has been made before any Delay Period or Pre-Announcement Period, however, the Company will provide reasonable cooperation as is reasonably requested during such Delay Period or Pre-Announcement Period to permit such Sponsor Supported Distribution to be commenced promptly following the expiration of such Delay Period or Pre-Announcement Period. For the avoidance of doubt, any Sponsor Supported Distribution shall not require any pre-clearance under any stock trading policies of the Company in effect at such time.
Pre-Announcement Periods
     For purposes of the three Substantial Distributions with which the Company is required to provide the Holders with assistance, it shall be deemed to be a Substantial Distribution for which the Company has provided assistance if the Holders request such assistance and the Substantial Distribution is cancelled, terminated or otherwise not consummated, unless (i) such cancellation, termination or failure to consummate such Substantial Distribution (x) is based upon material adverse information concerning the Company of which the Holders initiating such Substantial Distribution were not aware at the time of such request or (y) occurs prior to the time the Company has provided significant assistance or cooperation with respect to such proposed Substantial Distribution or (ii) the Holders reimburse the Company for all of its reasonable, related third party costs and expenses.
     (c) To the extent the Shelf Registration Statement is effective and available for use at the time of any proposed sale or offer of any Securities by any Holders participating in such distribution, each such Holder agrees that the sale and offer of such Securities made by it shall be made pursuant to such effective Shelf Registration Statement such that the transferee of such Securities will receive unrestricted Securitiesthat (i) transfers of Securities between the KKR Purchaser and the Bank Purchasers pursuant to the terms of any Swap Agreement, and (ii) transfers of Securities by any Bank Purchaser, pursuant to its rights under Section 5(b) of a Swap Agreement upon the occurrence of an Early Settlement Date, or pursuant to the exercise of a Bank Purchaser's rights under Section 6 of the Security Agreement, or by any Sponsor Purchaser in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Indenture, shall not be subject to this requirement.

     (iv) causing the Company's officers, directors, employees, accountants and auditors to supply all relevant information, and causing appropriate persons to be reasonably available for discussions concerning such documents, as reasonably requested by any such Holder, Underwriter, Initial Purchaser, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with any such Substantial Distribution as is customary for similar due diligence examinations;

     (vi) making appropriate members of senior management reasonably available to participate in conference calls with potential investors and make presentations to ratings agencies as is reasonably necessary and customary in secondary resale offerings of companies of comparable size, maturities and lines of business as the Company; and
     (vii) if an underwriting or purchase, sale or agency agreement is entered into, causing the same to set forth indemnification provisions and procedures substantially equivalent to the indemnification provisions and procedures set forth in Section 4 with respect to the Underwriters or Initial Purchasers and all other parties to be indemnified pursuant to said Section or, at the request of any Underwriters or Initial Purchasers, in the
 
form customarily provided to such Underwriters or Initial Purchasers in similar types of transactions.
     Other than as provided in this Section 5 (and in the context of a registered Substantial Distribution, the other applicable provisions of this Agreement), the Company shall not be obligated to cooperate to facilitate any underwritten offering to facilitate a Substantial Distribution or otherwise.
