Washington, D.C., October 25, 2007 Harman International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE:  HAR) today announced results for the first quarter ended September 30, 2007.  Net sales for the three months were $947.0 million, a 15 percent increase compared to $825.5 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per diluted share were $0.55 compared to $0.85 last year.  Excluding merger-related costs, earnings per diluted share were $0.62.
All three divisions reported double-digit sales growth for the first quarter.  Automotive net sales for the three months were $682.3 million compared to $601.0 million last year, an increase of 14 percent.  Consumer net sales increased 28 percent from $93.1 million a year ago to $119.4 million this quarter.  Professional net sales were $145.2 million compared to $131.4 million last year, an increase of 11 percent.
Dr. Sidney Harman, Executive Chairman, and Dinesh Paliwal, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented:
We achieved good results during the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  Sales growth was strong due to the ramp up of an infotainment system for Chrysler and robust sales of personal navigation devices in Europe.  Our initiative to develop cost saving strategies is underway and we expect to gain procurement, engineering and manufacturing efficiencies that will improve margins over the course of this fiscal year.
