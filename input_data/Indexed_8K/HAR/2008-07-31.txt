     The Severance Agreement provides that if, during the six months prior to or within two years following a change in control of the Company, Mr. Parker is terminated without cause or under certain circumstances terminates his own employment, he is entitled to receive a severance payment equal to two times the sum of (1) his highest annual base salary during any period prior to his termination and (2) his highest incentive pay during the three fiscal years preceding the change in control. The Severance Agreement also provides that the Company will pay Mr. Parker an additional amount for excise taxes. The Severance Agreement expires December 31, 2012. Thereafter, unless the Company or Mr. Parker has notified the other by the preceding September 30 that the Company or Mr. Parker, as appropriate, does not wish the agreement to be extended, the Severance Agreement will be automatically extended on the following January 1 for an additional year.
     The foregoing description of the Severance Agreement is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Severance Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     In addition, Mr. Parker has been appointed the Company's "chief accounting officer" effective August 16, 2008. Kevin Brown, the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, will continue as the Company's "chief accounting officer" through August 15, 2008.

(iii) A determination by the Executive (which determination will be conclusive and binding upon the parties to this Agreement, provided that the determination has been made in good faith and in all events will be presumed to have been made in good faith unless otherwise shown by the Company by clear and convincing evidence) that a change in circumstances has occurred following a Change in Control, including, without limitation, a change in the scope of the business or other activities for which the Executive was responsible immediately prior to the Change in Control, which has rendered the Executive substantially unable to carry out, has substantially hindered Executive's performance of, or has caused Executive to suffer a substantial reduction in, any of the authorities, powers, functions, responsibilities or duties attached to the position held by the Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control, which situation is not remedied within 10 calendar days after the Company receives written notice from the Executive of such determination;

(v) The Company relocates its principal executive offices (if such offices are the principal location of Executive's work), or requires the Executive to have his principal location of work changed, to any location that, in either case, is in excess of 50 miles from the principal executive office's location immediately prior to the Change in Control, or requires the Executive to travel away from his office in the course of discharging his responsibilities or duties at least 20% more (in terms of aggregate days in any calendar year or in any calendar quarter when annualized for purposes of comparison to any prior year) than was required of Executive in any of the three full years immediately prior to the Change in Control without, in either case, his prior written consent; or

(c) A termination by the Company pursuant to Section 3(a) or by the Executive pursuant to Section 3(b) will not affect any rights that the Executive may have pursuant to any agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary providing Employee Benefits, which rights shall be governed by the terms thereof; provided that the Executive shall not be entitled to severance pay under his employment agreement with the Company, if any, if entitled to it hereunder and any such amounts received thereunder shall be offset against the amounts hereunder.

5. . (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that this Agreement shall become operative and it shall be determined (as hereafter provided) that any payment (other than the Gross-Up payments provided for in this Section 5) or distribution by the Company or any of its affiliates to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable under the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement, including without limitation any stock option, performance share, performance unit, stock appreciation right or similar right, or the lapse or termination of any restriction on or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (or any successor provision thereto) by reason of being considered "contingent on a change in ownership or control" of the Company, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or to any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with respect to such tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such interest and penalties, being hereafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive, and the Company shall be required to pay, an additional payment or payments (collectively, a "Gross-Up Payment"); , , that no Gross-up Payment shall be made with respect to the Excise Tax, if any, attributable to (i) any incentive stock option, as defined by Section 422 of the Code ("ISO") granted prior to the execution of this Agreement, or (ii) any stock appreciation or similar right, whether or not limited, granted in tandem with any ISO described in clause (i). The Gross-Up Payment shall be in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment.
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
provided
however
(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5(f), all determinations required to be made under this Section 5, including whether an Excise Tax is payable by the Executive and the amount of such Excise Tax and whether a Gross-Up Payment is required to be paid by the Company to the Executive and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, if any, shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") selected by the Executive in his sole discretion. The Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and the Executive within 30 calendar days after the Termination Date, if applicable, and any such other
 
time or times as may be requested by the Company or the Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that any Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, the Company shall pay the required Gross-Up Payment to the Executive within five business days after receipt of such determination and calculations with respect to any Payment to the Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall, at the same time as it makes such determination, furnish the Company and the Executive an opinion that the Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal, state or local income or other tax return. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) and the possibility of similar uncertainty regarding applicable state or local tax law at the time of any determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (an "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts or fails to pursue its remedies pursuant to Section 5(f) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm to determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and the Executive as promptly as possible. Any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to, or for the benefit of, the Executive within five business days after receipt of such determination and calculations.
(c) The Company and the Executive shall each provide the Accounting Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the possession of the Company or the Executive, as the case may be, reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by Section 5(b). Any determination by the Accounting Firm as to the amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive.
(d) The federal, state and local income or other tax returns filed by the Executive shall be prepared and filed on a consistent basis with the determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the Excise Tax payable by the Executive. The Executive shall make proper payment of the amount of any Excise Tax, and at the request of the Company, provide to the Company true and correct copies (with any amendments) of the applicable portions of his federal income tax return as filed with the Internal Revenue Service and corresponding state and local tax returns, if relevant, as filed with the applicable taxing authority, and such other documents reasonably requested by the Company, evidencing such payment. If prior to the filing of the Executive's federal income tax return, or corresponding state or local tax return, if relevant, the Accounting Firm determines that the amount of the Gross-Up Payment should be reduced, the Executive shall within five business days pay to the Company the amount of such reduction.
(e) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by Section 5(b) shall be borne by the Company. If such fees and expenses are initially paid by the Executive, the Company shall reimburse the Executive the full amount of such fees and expenses within five business days after receipt from the Executive of a statement therefore and reasonable evidence of Executive's payment thereof.
(f) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as promptly as practicable but no later than 10 business days after the Executive actually receives notice of such claim and the Executive shall further apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid (in each case, to the extent known by the Executive). The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 30-calendar-day period following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company and (ii) the date that any payment of amount with respect to such claim is due. If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
(i) provide the Company with any written records or documents in his possession relating to such claim reasonably requested by the Company;
(ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including without limitation accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney competent in respect of the subject matter and reasonably selected by the Company;
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and
 
(iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; , , that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Executive, on an after-tax basis, for and against any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(f), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with the contest of any claim contemplated by this Section 5(f) and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim (provided, however, that the Executive may participate therein at his own cost and expense) and may, at its option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; , , that if the Company directs the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an interest  free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income or other tax, including interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed with respect to such advance; and , , that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which the contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of any such contested claim shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

(g) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f), the Executive receives any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 5(f)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after any taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial or refund prior to the expiration of 30 calendar days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of any such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid by the Company to the Executive pursuant to this Section 5.
(h) In the event any obligation of the Executive to repay any amounts due hereunder would be a violation of the "loan" provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, such obligation shall be treated as null and void .
ab initio
6. . The Company hereby acknowledges that it will be difficult and may be impossible for the Executive to find reasonably comparable employment following the Termination Date and that the non-competition covenant contained in Section 8 will further limit the employment opportunities for the Executive. In addition, the Company acknowledges that its severance pay plans applicable in general to its salaried employees do not provide for mitigation, offset or reduction of any severance payment received thereunder. Accordingly, the payment of the severance compensation by the Company to the Executive in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is hereby acknowledged by the Company to be reasonable, and the Executive will not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor will any profits, income, earnings or other benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset, reduction or any other obligation on the part of the Executive under this agreement or otherwise.
No Mitigation Obligation
7. . (a) The Executive shall not be required to incur legal fees and the related expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Executive's rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because such costs substantially would detract from the Executive's benefits under this Agreement. Accordingly, if it should appear to the Executive that the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or
Legal Fees and Expenses
 
unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Executive the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain counsel of Executive's choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided, to advise and represent the Executive in connection with any such interpretation, enforcement or defense, including without limitation the initiation or defense of any litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any Director, officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with the Company, in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing or prior attorney-client relationship between the Company and such counsel, the Company irrevocably consents to the Executive's entering into an attorney-client relationship with such counsel, and in that connection the Company and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall exist between the Executive and such counsel. Without respect to whether the Executive prevails, in whole or in part, in connection with any of the foregoing, the Company will pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all attorneys' and related fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with any of the foregoing. However, if the Executive brings an action in bad faith, or with no colorable claim of success, the Company shall not pay for any of Executive's attorneys' fees or related expenses.
(b) Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 7(a) of this Agreement, in the event a Change in Control occurs, the performance of the Company's obligations under this Section 7 shall be secured by amounts deposited or to be deposited in trust pursuant to certain trust agreements to which the Company shall be a party, which amounts deposited shall in the aggregate be not less than $1,000,000, providing that the fees and expenses of counsel selected from time to time by the Executive pursuant to Section 7(a) shall be paid, or reimbursed to the Executive if paid by the Executive, either in accordance with the terms of such trust agreements, or, if not so provided, on a regular, periodic basis upon presentation by the Executive to the trustee of a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in accordance with its customary practices. Any failure by the Company to satisfy any of its obligations under this Section 7(b) shall not limit the rights of the Executive hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, the Executive shall have the status of a general unsecured creditor of the Company and shall have no right to, or security interest in, any assets of the Company or any Subsidiary.
8. . (a) For a period ending one year following the Termination Date, if the Executive shall have received or shall be receiving benefits under Section 4, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, engage in any Competitive Activity; provided that the foregoing shall not apply if the Termination Date was prior to the Change in Control and Executive had already commenced such activity.
Competitive Activity; Confidentiality; Nonsolicitation
(b) During the Term, the Company agrees that it will disclose to Executive its confidential or proprietary information (as defined in this Section 8(b)) to the extent necessary for Executive to carry out his obligations to the Company. The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, during the Term or thereafter disclose to any person not employed by the Company, or use in connection with engaging in competition with the Company, any confidential or proprietary information of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "confidential or proprietary information" will include all information of any nature and in any form that is owned by the Company and that is not publicly available (other than by Executive's breach of this Section 8(b)) or generally known to persons engaged in businesses similar or related to those of the Company. Confidential or proprietary information will include, without limitation, the Company's financial matters, customers, employees, industry contracts, strategic business plans, product development (or other proprietary product data), marketing plans, and all other secrets and all other information of a confidential or proprietary nature. For purposes of the preceding two sentences, the term "Company" will also include any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Restricted Group"). The foregoing obligations imposed by this Section 8(b) will not apply (i) during the Term, in the course of the business of and for the benefit of the Company, (ii) if such confidential or proprietary information will have become, through no fault of the Executive, generally known to the public or (iii) if the Executive is required by law to make disclosure (after giving the Company notice and an opportunity to contest such requirement).
(c) The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that during the Term and for one year thereafter Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, on behalf of Executive or on behalf of any person, firm or company, directly or indirectly, attempt to influence, persuade or induce, or assist any other person in so persuading or inducing, any management employee of the Restricted Group to give up, or not to commence,
 
employment or a business relationship with the Restricted Group, provided the foregoing shall not be violated by advertising or searches not specifically targeted at the management employees of the Restricted Group, or serving as a reference.
(d) Executive and the Company agree that the covenants contained in this Section 8 are reasonable under the circumstances, and further agree that if in the opinion of any court of competent jurisdiction any such covenant is not reasonable in any respect, such court will have the right, power and authority to excise or modify any provision or provisions of such covenants as to the court will appear not reasonable and to enforce the remainder of the covenants as so amended. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law available to the Company for breach of any of his obligations under this Section 8 would be inadequate and that damages flowing from such a breach may not readily be susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, Executive acknowledges, consents and agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law, in equity or under this Agreement, upon adequate proof of his violation of any such provision of this Agreement, the Company will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach, without the necessity of proof of actual damage.
9. . Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement will create any right or duty on the part of the Company or the Executive to have the Executive remain in the employment of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to or following any Change in Control.
Employment Rights
10. . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as the Company is required to withhold pursuant to any applicable law, regulation or ruling.
Withholding of Taxes
11. .
Successors and Binding Agreement
(a) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company, including without limitation any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor shall thereafter be deemed the "Company" for the purposes of this Agreement), but will not otherwise be assignable, transferable or delegable by the Company.
(b) This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees and legatees.
(c) This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the parties hereto shall, without the consent of the other, assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder except as expressly provided in Sections 11(a) and 11(b). Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Executive's right to receive payments hereunder will not be assignable, transferable or delegable, whether by pledge, creation of a security interest, or otherwise, other than by a transfer by Executive's will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 11(c), the Company shall have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned, transferred or delegated.
12. . For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications, including without limitation notices, consents, requests or approvals, required or permitted to be given hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when hand delivered or dispatched by electronic facsimile transmission (with receipt thereof orally confirmed), or five business days after having been mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or three business days after having been sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service such as FedEx, UPS, or Purolator, addressed to the Company (to the attention of the Secretary of the Company) at its principal executive office and to the Executive at his address on the books of the Company, or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the other in writing and in accordance herewith, except that notices of changes of address shall be effective only upon receipt.
Notices
13. . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.
Governing Law
 
14. . Any disputes, litigation, proceedings or other legal actions by any party to this Agreement in connection with or relating to this Agreement or any matters described or contemplated in this Agreement may be instituted in the courts of the State of Delaware or of the United States sitting in the State of Delaware. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States sitting in the State of Delaware in connection with any such dispute, litigation, proceeding or other legal action arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
Consent to Jurisdiction
15. . If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstances will not be affected, and the provision so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal will be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable, valid or legal.
Validity
16. . No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by the Executive and the Company. No waiver by either party to this Agreement at any time of any breach by the other contracting party or compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party will be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, expressed or implied with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. References to Sections are to references to Sections of this Agreement.
Miscellaneous
17. . To the extent that there is a material risk that any payments under this Agreement may result in the imposition of an additional tax to the Executive under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A ("Section 409A"), Harman will reasonably cooperate with the Executive to amend this Agreement such that payments hereunder comply with Section 409A without materially changing the economic value of this Agreement to either party.
Code Section 409A
18. . If the Executive is at the time of his separation from service (as defined under Section 409A) with Harman (other than as a result of his death) a "specified employee", as such term is defined under Section 409A, any payment due to the Executive hereunder that indicates it is subject to the "Section 409A Delay" shall be delayed until the earlier of his death or six (6) months after such separation from service and shall then be promptly paid to the Executive in a lump sum.
Section 409A Delay
19. . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.
