Committee
Company
     On October 21, 2008, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a definitive proxy statement related to the Company's 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. The proxy statement disclosed that the Committee was considering changes to the special cash bonus provided to Mr. Paliwal under a November 2007 amendment to his May 2007 letter agreement. Under the terms of the special cash bonus, Mr. Paliwal has the ability to earn up to $75 million based on the Company's enterprise value in November 2012. No bonus will be paid if the Company's enterprise value at the end of the measurement period is less than 1.3 times the Company's enterprise value on November 9, 2007. The changes considered by the Committee were to replace the special cash bonus with an equity award under the Company's 2002 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended, and to adjust the enterprise value performance levels based on a $43 stock price. At the request of Mr. Paliwal and as discussed above, the Committee is no longer considering these modifications. Assuming current debt levels and shares outstanding, Mr. Paliwal will not receive any bonus at the end of the measurement period unless the Company achieves a stock price at that time of approximately $115.Mr. Paliwal will receive a pro rata portion of the bonus between $0 and $75 million if the Company's enterprise value is between 1.3 and 3 times the Company's enterprise value on November 9, 2007. For Mr. Paliwal to earn the maximum award of $75 million, the Company must achieve a stock price of approximately $260 at the end of the measurement period, assuming current debt levels and shares outstanding.
