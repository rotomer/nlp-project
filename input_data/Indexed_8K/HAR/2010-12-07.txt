Multi-Currency Credit Agreement and Guarantee and Collateral Agreement
On December 1, 2010, Harman International Industries, Incorporated (the "Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Harman Holding GmbH & Co. KG ("Harman KG"), entered into a Multi-Currency Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc. and Unicredit Bank AG, New York Branch, as joint lead arrangers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, HSBC Bank USA, National Association and Unicredit Bank AG, New York Branch, as syndication agents, Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and RBS Citizens, N.A., as documentation agents, and the other banks and financial institutions party thereto.
The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") in the amount of $550 million (the "Aggregate Commitment"), of which up to $60 million will be available for letters of credit. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Aggregate Commitment may be increased up to a maximum aggregate amount of $700 million. The Company may select interest rates for the Revolving Credit Facility equal to (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin, which in each case is based on the Company's total leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company is obligated to pay a facility fee on the Aggregate Commitment, whether drawn or undrawn, which is based on the Company's total leverage ratio. Any proceeds from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.
The Credit Agreement includes certain financial condition covenants, including but not limited to covenants that do not permit the Company to allow (i) its ratio of consolidated EBITDA (less capital expenditures) to consolidated cash interest expense to be less than 3.25:1, (ii) its ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA to exceed 4:1, and (iii) its ratio of consolidated senior debt to consolidated EBITDA to exceed 3:1, each calculated as of the end of the applicable fiscal quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis. The terms "consolidated EBITDA," "capital expenditures," "consolidated cash interest expense," "consolidated total debt," and "consolidated senior debt" are defined in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also contains certain negative covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to pay dividends, make capital expenditures, incur debt and liens, make fundamental changes, sell assets, make investments and acquisitions, undertake transactions with affiliates, undertake sale and leaseback transactions, and modify or prepay certain debt (including the Company's senior convertible notes). The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default, including failure to make timely payments, breaches of representations or covenants, or a change of control of the Company, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement.
At December 1, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
On December 1, 2010, in connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company, Harman KG, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, entered into a guarantee and collateral agreement (the "Guarantee Agreement"), that provides, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and each of the subsidiary guarantors named therein and that the obligations generally are secured by a first lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain subsidiaries named therein, subject to certain exceptions.
A copy of the Credit Agreement and a copy of the Guarantee Agreement are filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01. The foregoing summaries of the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement filed herewith.
The Credit Agreement effectively replaces the Company's previous revolving credit facility, as evidenced by the Second Amended and Restated Multi-Currency, Multi-Option Credit Agreement dated as of March 31, 2009, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 (the "2009 Facility"). As a result of such replacement, the Company voluntarily terminated the 2009 Facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2009 Facility as of December 1, 2010, and no early termination penalties were incurred by the Company as a result of the termination of the 2009 Facility.
 
The information set forth in the last paragraph of Item 1.01 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to (i) in the case of any such Loans denominated in Dollars, the daily average Federal funds rate, as quoted by the Administrative Agent or (ii) in the case of any Loans denominated in an Available Foreign Currency, the rate customary in such Currency for settlement of similar inter-bank obligations, as quoted by the Administrative Agent, in each case for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the applicable Class of Loans in such Currency hereunder, on demand, from the applicable Borrower of such Loan.
(c) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to subsection 3.4, 4.3(b) or 10.7, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by
 
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Banks to satisfy such Lender's obligations thereto under such subsection until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such subsection, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
4.4. . (a) If after the Effective Date the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) applicable generally in the jurisdiction of such Lender to banking institutions of the same type as such Lender
Requirements of Law
(i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Eurocurrency Loan made by it to a Borrower or any Extension of Credit to a Borrower, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment made by a Borrower (whether or not any additional amount is payable by a Borrower pursuant to subsection 4.5) and the imposition of, or any change in the rate or other basis of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender);
(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits with or for the account of, or advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, any office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate; or
(iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition affecting Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender to a Borrower, or Extensions of Credit by such Lender to a Borrower;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount which such Lender reasonably deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans to a Borrower or issuing for or participating in Letters of Credit of the Company or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, and such Lender has no reasonable means (as it shall determine in its sole discretion acting in good faith) to avoid such costs or reductions, then, in any such case, the applicable Borrower of such Loan or, in the case of the Company, with respect to such Letter of Credit shall promptly pay such Lender following receipt of a certificate of such Lender in accordance with subsection 4.4(c) such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction suffered. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith shall be deemed for purposes of this Section to be a change after the Effective Date, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
 
(b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) made subsequent to the Effective Date shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital, if any, as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, each Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender following receipt of a certificate of such Lender in accordance with subsection 4.4(c) its Applicable Percentage of such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for any such reduction suffered. Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph (b), no Lender shall be entitled to demand compensation pursuant to this paragraph (b) if it shall not then be the general practice of such Lender or such corporation to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other comparable credit agreements.
(c) A certificate of each Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or such corporation as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, and setting forth in reasonable detail an explanation of the basis of requesting such compensation in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) above, including calculations in detail comparable to the detail set forth in Certificates delivered to such Lender in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other comparable credit agreements, shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Borrower, as required by paragraph (a) or (b) above, shall pay each Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered to it within ten days after its receipt of the same.
(d) Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to such period or any other period, except that no Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this subsection 4.4 for any such costs incurred or any such reduction suffered with respect to any date unless such Lender shall have notified the Borrowers that it will demand compensation for such costs or reductions under paragraph (c) above, not more than six months after the later of (i) such date and (ii) the date on which such Lender shall have become aware of such costs or reductions. The protection of this subsection 4.4 shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change or condition that shall have occurred or been imposed.
(e) The agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
4.5. . (a) All payments made by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
Taxes
 
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority (other than Excluded Taxes). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees deductions or withholdings (together with any interest, additions to tax and penalties applicable thereto, "") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable by a Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement. Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by a Borrower, such Borrower shall timely pay such Non-Excluded Taxes and shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by such Borrower showing payment thereof. If the applicable Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, such Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Borrower shall not be required to make any payments in respect of Non-Excluded Taxes to any Lender that has changed the Funding Office at which it maintains the Extensions of Credit to which such Non-Excluded Taxes relate (other than any such change in Funding Office made by such Lender pursuant to subsection 4.7 to avoid or minimize the application or effects of subsection 4.4 or 4.5) in an amount greater than such Borrower would have been required to pay pursuant to this subsection 4.5 if no such change in Funding Office had occurred. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
Non-Excluded Taxes
(b) (i) Each Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and any other relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company, any other relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding, that (except in the case of taxes imposed by the United States or Germany that are in effect as of the date hereof) such Lender has received written notice from a Borrower advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company, any other relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company, any other relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company, any other relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements, provided such Lender is legally able to do so and provided that (except in the case of taxes imposed by the United States that are in effect as of the date hereof) such Lender has received written notice from a Borrower advising it of the availability of any exemption from such backup withholding or information reporting requirements and supplying all applicable documentation.

Exhibit E
(B) deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent two further current copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Company; and
(C) obtain such extensions of time for filing and complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent;
unless in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the Company and the Administrative Agent of the legal basis therefor. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a Participant pursuant to subsection 11.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms and statements required pursuant to this subsection, that in the case of a Participant such Participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased.

and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, (i) to comply with its obligations under FATCA, (ii) to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA, and (iii) to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment (or to determine that no amount is required to be deducted and withheld from such payment). For purposes of this subsection 4.5(b)(iii), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date hereof.
(c) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority (but, in the case of any Non-Excluded Taxes for which an additional amount is payable by a Borrower under this subsection 4.5, only to the extent that the applicable Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Non-Excluded Taxes and without limiting the obligation of a Borrower to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this subsection 4.5(c) shall be paid within ten days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
4.6. .

Such loss or reasonable expense shall be equal to the sum of (i) such Lender's actual costs and expenses incurred (other than any lost profits) in connection with, or by reason of, any of the foregoing events and (ii) an amount equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such Lender of (A) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted or continued (assumed to be the Eurocurrency Rate applicable thereto) for the period from and including the date for such payment, prepayment, conversion or continuation to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan over (B) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid, converted or continued for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts, including calculations in reasonable detail, that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this subsection 4.6 shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

4.8. . (a) The Company will monitor the borrowings and repayments of Loans by the Borrowers and the issuance of and drawings under Letters of Credit and Time Drafts, with the object of preventing any request for an Extension of Credit that would result in the aggregate amount of the Exposure being in excess of the Commitments and of promptly identifying and remedying any circumstance where, by reason of changes in exchange rates, the aggregate amount of the Exposure does exceed the Commitments. In the event that at any time the Company determines that the aggregate amount of the Exposure exceeds the aggregate amount of the Commitments by more than 5%, each Borrower will, as soon as practicable but in any event within five Business Days of making such determination, make such repayments or prepayments of Loans made to such Borrower as shall be necessary to cause the aggregate amount of the Exposure to no longer exceed the Commitments.

(b) The Administrative Agent will calculate the aggregate amount of the Exposure (including the aggregate amount of L/C Obligations) from time to time, and in any event not less frequently than once during each calendar week. In making such calculations, the Administrative Agent will rely on the information most recently received by it from Issuing Banks in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit (including, with respect to such Issuing Banks, the conversion ratios in respect of the non-Dollar denominated Letters of Credit provided to the Administrative Agent by such Issuing Banks on the fifteenth day and the end of each month (or
 
on the Business Day next succeeding such days)). Upon making each such calculation, the Administrative Agent will inform the Company of the results thereof and, upon the request of any Lender, inform such Lender of the results thereof.
(c) In the event that on any date the Administrative Agent calculates that the aggregate amount of the Exposure exceeds the aggregate amount of the Commitments by more than 5%, the Administrative Agent will give notice to such effect to the Company. Within five Business Days after receipt of any such notice, each Borrower will, as soon as practicable but in any event within five Business Days of receipt of such notice, make such repayments or prepayments of Loans made to such Borrower as shall be necessary to cause the aggregate amount of the Exposure to no longer exceed the Commitments.
(d) Any prepayment required to be made pursuant to this subsection 4.8 shall be accompanied by payment of amounts payable, if any, pursuant to subsection 4.6 in respect of the amount so prepaid.

(e) Each Grantor, either itself or through any agent, employee, licensee or designee, shall (i) inform the Administrative Agent on an annual basis of each application
 
by itself, or through any agent, employee, licensee or designee, for any Patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, United States Copyright Office or any office or agency in any political subdivision of the United States or in any other country or any political subdivision thereof during the preceding twelve-month period, in each case to the extent such application or registration relates to Intellectual Property material to the normal course of such Grantor's business and (ii) execute and deliver any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Administrative Agent may otherwise reasonably request to evidence the Administrative Agent's security interest in such Intellectual Property and each Grantor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent as its attorney in fact to execute and file such writing for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed; such power being coupled with an interest is irrevocable.
(f) Each Grantor shall exercise its reasonable business judgment with the practice in any proceeding before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, United States Copyright Office or any office or agency in any political subdivision of the United States or in any other country or any political subdivision thereof, to maintain and pursue each material application relating to the Intellectual Property (and to obtain the relevant grant or registration) and to maintain each issued Patent and each registration of the Trademarks and Copyrights that is material to the conduct of any Grantor's business, including timely filings of applications for renewal, affidavits of use, affidavits of incontestability and payment of maintenance fees, and, if consistent with good business judgment, to initiate opposition, interference and cancelation proceedings against third parties.
(g) In the event that any Grantor knows or has reason to believe that any Article 9 Collateral consisting of Patent, Trademark or Copyright material to the conduct of any Grantor's business has been or is about to be materially infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third party, such Grantor promptly shall notify the Administrative Agent and shall, if the Grantor deems it necessary in its reasonable business judgment, promptly sue and recover any and all damages and take such other actions as are reasonably appropriate under the circumstances.
(h) Upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all requisite consents or approvals by the licensor of each Copyright License, Patent License or Trademark License under which such Grantor is a licensee to effect the assignment of all such Grantor's right, title and interest thereunder to the Administrative Agent or its designee.
SECTION 5.01. . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor agrees to deliver each item of Collateral to the Administrative Agent on demand, and it is agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the
Remedies Upon Default
 
same or different times: (a) to the extent permitted under applicable law, with respect to any Article 9 Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property, on demand, to cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such Article 9 Collateral by the applicable Grantors to the Administrative Agent, or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, any such Article 9 Collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements to the extent that waivers cannot be obtained), and (b) to the extent permitted under applicable law, with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the Article 9 Collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the Article 9 Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Article 9 Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall be authorized at any such sale of securities (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any sale of Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal that such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
The Administrative Agent shall give the applicable Grantors 10 days' written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Administrative Agent's intention to make any sale of Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may,
 
without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured Obligations paid in full. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.
SECTION 5.02. . Subject to applicable law, the Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, as follows:
Application of Proceeds
FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Secured Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Grantor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document in its capacity as such;
SECOND, to the payment in full of the Secured Obligations secured by such Collateral (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the applicable Secured Parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the applicable Secured Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and
 
THIRD, to the Grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
The Administrative Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale of Collateral by the Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Proceeds of Collateral securing solely the Foreign Secured Obligations shall be applied to Domestic Secured Obligations.
SECTION 5.03. . For the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Agreement at such time as the Administrative Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent an irrevocable, nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantor) to use, license or sublicense any of the Article 9 Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, in each case wherever the same may be located, and including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. The use of such license by the Administrative Agent may be exercised, at the option of the Administrative Agent, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, that any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the Administrative Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the Grantors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.
Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property
provided
SECTION 5.04. . In view of the position of the Grantors in relation to the Pledged Collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted in any jurisdiction analogous in purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the "") with respect to any disposition of the Pledged Collateral permitted hereunder. Each Grantor understands that compliance with the Federal Securities Laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any Pledged Collateral could dispose of the same. Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Administrative Agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the Pledged Collateral under applicable Blue Sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect in the United States or any other country. Each Grantor recognizes that in light of such restrictions and limitations the Administrative Agent may, with respect to any sale of the Pledged Collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire
Securities Act
Federal Securities Laws
 
such Pledged Collateral for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged Collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the Federal Securities Laws and (b) may approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the event of any such sale, the Administrative Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the Pledged Collateral at a price that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached. The provisions of this Section 5.04 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the Administrative Agent sells.
SECTION 6.01. . In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors and Grantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 6.03), each Borrower agrees that (a) in the event a payment in respect of any obligation shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any Grantor shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement or any other Security Document to satisfy in whole or in part a Secured Obligation owed to any Secured Party, the Company shall indemnify such Grantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.
Indemnity and Subrogation
SECTION 6.02. . Each Guarantor and Grantor (a "") agrees (subject to Section 6.03) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor hereunder in respect of any Secured Obligation in respect of which the Contributing Party is liable hereunder or assets of any other Grantor (other than the Company) shall be sold pursuant to any Security Document to satisfy any Secured Obligation in respect of which the Contributing Party is liable hereunder and such other Guarantor or Grantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Company as provided in Section 6.01, the Contributing Party shall indemnify the Claiming Party in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Party on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors and Grantors liable for such Secured
Contribution and Subrogation
Contributing Party
Claiming Party
 
Obligation, or that have granted Liens to secure such Secured Obligation, on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor or Grantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 7.15, the date of the supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor or Grantor). Any Contributing Party making any payment to a Claiming Party pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall (subject to Section 6.03) be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under Section 6.01 to the extent of such payment.
SECTION 6.03. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent to do so would not constitute unlawful financial assistance, the Guarantors and Grantors shall have no rights under Sections 6.01 and 6.02 and shall not exercise any other rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise until all of the payment in full in cash of the Secured Obligations owed by the Loan Party against whom the Guarantor or Grantor would otherwise have rights under Section 6.01 or 6.02. No failure on the part of the Company or any Guarantor or Grantor to make the payments required by Sections 6.01 and 6.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor or Grantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor and Grantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor or Grantor hereunder.
Limitations, Subordination
SECTION 7.01. . All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in subsection 11.2 of the Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Subsidiary Loan Party shall be given to it in care of the Company as provided in subsection 11.2 of the Credit Agreement.
Notices
SECTION 7.02. . (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Secured Party in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Secured Parties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 7.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Waivers; Amendment
 
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with subsections 11.1 and 11.1A of the Credit Agreement.
SECTION 7.03. . (a) The parties hereto agree that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement of its expenses incurred hereunder as provided in subsection 11.5 of the Credit Agreement.
Administrative Agent's Fees and Expenses; Indemnification
(b) Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other Loan Documents, each Grantor and each Guarantor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and the other Indemnitees against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by any Guarantor or Grantor arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, or to the Collateral, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
provided
(c) Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Secured Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents. The provisions of this Section 7.03 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Secured Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party. All amounts due under this Section 7.03 shall be payable on written demand therefor.
SECTION 7.04. . Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any Guarantor, Grantor or the Administrative Agent that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns.
Successors and Assigns
 
SECTION 7.05. . All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Secured Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any Secured Party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under any Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
Survival of Agreement
SECTION 7.06. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Loan Party when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Loan Party shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein or in the Collateral (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly provided in this Agreement or the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Loan Party and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Loan Party without the approval of any other Loan Party and without affecting the obligations of any other Loan Party hereunder.
Counterparts; Effectiveness; Several Agreement
SECTION 7.07. . Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. All rights, remedies and powers provided in this Agreement may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provision of law, and all the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law that may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they shall not render this Agreement invalid, unenforceable, in whole or in part, or not entitled to be recorded, registered or filed under the provisions of any applicable law.
Severability; Limitation by Law
 
SECTION 7.08. . If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Secured Party is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Secured Party to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against any of and all the obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement owed to such Secured Party, irrespective of whether or not such Secured Party shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Secured Party under this Section 7.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Secured Party may have.
Right of Set-Off
SECTION 7.09. . (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York, that the provisions set forth in Section 2.04 shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process
provided
(b) Each of the Loan Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the Loan Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Grantor, Guarantor, or their respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
(c) Each of the Loan Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 7.09. Each of the Loan Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
 
(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 7.01. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
SECTION 7.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 7.10.
SECTION 7.11. . Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
Headings
SECTION 7.12. . To the extent permitted by law, all rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Security Interest, the grant of a security interest in the Pledged Collateral and all obligations of each Grantor and Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any agreement with respect to any of the Secured Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Secured Obligations, or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Grantor or Guarantor in respect of the Secured Obligations or this Agreement.
Security Interest Absolute
SECTION 7.13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document (including any provision for, reference to, or acknowledgement of, any Lien or Permitted Lien), nothing herein and no approval by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party of any Lien or Permitted Lien (whether such approval is oral or in writing) shall be construed as or deemed to constitute a subordination by the Administrative Agent or any
No Subordination
 
Secured Party of any security interest or other right, interest or Lien in or to the Collateral or any part thereof in favor of any Lien or Permitted Lien or any holder of any Lien or Permitted Lien.
SECTION 7.14. . (a) This Agreement, the guarantees made herein, the Security Interest and all other security interests granted hereby shall terminate when all the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend under the Credit Agreement, the L/C Obligations have been reduced to zero and the Issuing Bank has no further obligations to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement.
Termination or Release
(b) A Subsidiary Loan Party (other than the Additional Borrower) shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder and the Security Interest in the Collateral of such Subsidiary Loan Party shall be automatically released upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement as a result of which such Subsidiary Loan Party ceases to be a Subsidiary, that the Majority Lenders shall have consented to such transaction (to the extent required by the Credit Agreement) and the terms of such consent did not provide otherwise.
provided
(c) Upon any sale or other transfer by any Grantor of any Collateral that is permitted under the Credit Agreement (other than a sale or other transfer to a Borrower or any Subsidiary), or upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the security interest granted hereby in any Collateral pursuant to subsection 11.1A of the Credit Agreement, the security interest in such Collateral shall be automatically released.
(d) In connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7.14, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to any Grantor, at such Grantor's expense, all documents that such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section 7.14 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 7.15. . Upon execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent and a Subsidiary of an instrument in the form of Exhibit I hereto, such Subsidiary shall become a Subsidiary Loan Party and a Guarantor and a Grantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Subsidiary Loan Party and a Guarantor and a Grantor herein. The execution and delivery of any such instrument shall not require the consent of any other Loan Party hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Loan Party hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Loan Party as a party to this Agreement.
Additional Subsidiaries
SECTION 7.16. . Each Grantor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent the attorney-in-fact of such Grantor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact
 
Administrative Agent shall have the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, with full power of substitution either in the Administrative Agent's name or in the name of such Grantor (a) to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof; (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the Collateral; (c) to sign the name of any Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Collateral; (d) to send verifications of Accounts Receivable to any Account Debtor; (e) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral; (f) to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral; (g) to notify, or to require any Grantor to notify, Account Debtors to make payment directly to the Administrative Agent; and (h) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Administrative Agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Administrative Agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby. The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
provided
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.
