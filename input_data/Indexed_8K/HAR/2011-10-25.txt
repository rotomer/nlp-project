Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Effective October 21, 2011, Harman International Industries, Incorporated ("Harman") entered into the First Amendment to Registration Rights Agreement (the "Amendment") with KKR I-H Limited, GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P., GS Capital Partners VI Parallel, L.P., GS Capital Partners VI Offshore Fund, L.P., GS Capital Partners VI GmbH & Co. KG, Citibank, N.A. and HSBC USA, Inc. (collectively, the "Purchasers"), which amended the previously executed Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of October 23, 2007 (the "Registration Rights Agreement").
Under the Registration Rights Agreement, Harman agreed to keep effective a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of its 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (the "Notes") and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes until the earlier of (i) such time as all of the securities cease to be Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement); and (ii) January 23, 2012, the date that is five years and three months after the closing for the Notes. The Amendment permits Harman, so long as it remains a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended), to allow the shelf registration statement filed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement to expire on or after October 23, 2011, and provides that no additional interest will be payable by Harman as a result of such expiration. Harman has further agreed, pursuant to the Amendment, to use its reasonable efforts to cause to become effective a new shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the Notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes within seven Business Days following the earlier of (i) receipt by Harman of a written request by any of the Purchasers or (ii) Harman ceasing to be a well-known seasoned issuer.
The foregoing description of the Amendment is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Amendment, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, and incorporated herein by reference.
