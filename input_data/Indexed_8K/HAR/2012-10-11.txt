Multi-Currency Credit Agreement and Guarantee Agreement
On October 10, 2012, Harman International Industries, Incorporated (the "Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Harman Holding GmbH & Co. KG ("Harman KG"), entered into a Multi-Currency Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., UniCredit Capital Markets LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint lead arrangers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., UniCredit Capital Markets LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as syndication agents, Bank of America, N.A., RBS Citizens, N.A., TD Bank, National Association and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as documentation agents, and the other banks and financial institutions party thereto.
The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a five-year unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") in the amount of $750 million (the "Aggregate Revolving Commitment") with availability in currencies other than United States dollars of up to $550 million and (ii) a five-year unsecured United States dollar term loan facility (the "Term Facility" and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the "Facilities") in the amount of $300 million (the "Aggregate Term Commitment" and together with the Aggregate Revolving Commitment, the "Aggregate Commitment"). Up to $60 million of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment will be available for letters of credit. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Aggregate Commitment may be increased by up to $250 million. The Company may select interest rates for each Facility equal to (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin, which in each case is based on the Company's total leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company is obligated to pay a facility fee on the Aggregate Revolving Commitment, whether drawn or undrawn, which is based on the Company's total leverage ratio. Any proceeds from borrowings under the Facilities may be used for general corporate purposes.
The Credit Agreement includes certain financial condition covenants, including covenants that do not permit the Company to allow (i) its ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense to be less than 3.5:1.0 or (ii) its ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA to exceed 3.5:1.0, or following certain acquisitions, 4.0:1.0, each calculated as of the end of the applicable fiscal quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis. The terms "consolidated EBITDA," "consolidated cash interest expense," and "consolidated total debt" are defined in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also contains certain negative covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to pay dividends, permit certain of its subsidiaries to incur debt, incur liens, make fundamental changes, sell assets, undertake transactions with affiliates and undertake sale and leaseback transactions. The Facilities are subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default, including failure to make timely payments, breaches of representations or covenants, or a change of control of the Company, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement.
At October 10, 2012, there were no outstanding borrowings and approximately $8.6 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility and $300 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Facility.
On October 10, 2012, in connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company, Harman KG, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, entered into a guarantee agreement (the "Guarantee Agreement"), that provides, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and each of the subsidiary guarantors named therein.
A copy of the Credit Agreement and a copy of the Guarantee Agreement are filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01. The foregoing summaries of the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement filed herewith.

Morgan Securities LLC, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc. and UniCredit Bank AG, New York Branch, as Joint Lead Arrangers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, HSBC Bank USA, National Association and UniCredit Bank AG, New York Branch, as Syndication Agents, Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and RBS Citizens, N.A., as Documentation Agents, and the other banks and financial institutions party thereto, dated as of December 1, 2010 (the "2010 Facility"). There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2010 Facility as of October 10, 2012, and no early termination penalties were incurred by the Company as a result of the termination of the 2010 Facility. As of October 10, 2012, all of the approximately $8.6 million of letters of credit that were previously outstanding under the 2010 Facility were deemed to be issued and outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

In this event, any Lender that gives notice pursuant to this subsection will be required to participate in the Loan in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent Amount) and its participation will be treated as a separate Loan denominated in Dollars during that Interest Period.
Unavailability of Available Foreign Currency
2.13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) at no time and in no circumstances shall the Additional Borrower be liable for any Company Obligations or any other indebtedness, liabilities or obligations of the Company hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, whether incurred by the Company before, on or after the Effective Date and (b) with respect to any borrowing by either of the Company or the Additional Borrower of any Loans hereunder, such Loans are for the applicable requesting Borrower's own account, and such Loans and such Borrower's other obligations hereunder are obligations of such Borrower and do not constitute joint and several obligations of both Borrowers (it being understood, however, that (i) the obligations of the Additional Borrower are guaranteed by the Company and the other Loan Parties and (ii) the obligations of the Company under the Loan Documents are guaranteed by Loan Parties that are Domestic Subsidiaries, in each case as and to the extent provided in the Guarantee Agreement).

(i) all or any part of the L/C Obligations of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages in respect of Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Commitments but only to the extent the aggregate amount of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Exposure following such reallocation does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Commitments;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall, within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Banks only the Company's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's L/C Obligations (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection 3.10 for so long as such L/C Obligations are outstanding;

(iv) if the L/C Obligations of the non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Commitment Percentages in respect of Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Commitments; and
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's L/C Obligations is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Commitment that was utilized by such L/C Obligations) and Letter of Credit fees payable under subsection 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's L/C Obligations shall be payable to such Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such Defaulting Lender's L/C Obligations are reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(vi) so long as such Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding L/C Obligations will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Company in accordance with subsection 2.14(c), and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with subsection 2.14(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 
(d) If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Parent of any Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Lender commits to extend credit, then such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless such Issuing Bank shall have entered into arrangements with the Company or such Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Lender, satisfactory to such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to eliminate any risk to it in respect of such Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Lender hereunder.
(e) In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company and, in the case of a Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Lender, each Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the L/C Obligations of the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Revolving Lender's Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Commitment, if any, and on such date such Revolving Lender shall purchase at par such of the US Tranche Revolving Loans and/or Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Loans of the other Revolving Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Revolving Lender to hold such Revolving Loans in accordance with its Revolving Commitment Percentage of each Class.

(b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) made subsequent to the Effective Date shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or its obligations hereunder, including the Commitments of such Lender, or the Loans made by, or the Letters of Credit issued or participations in such Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, each Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender following receipt of a certificate of such Lender in accordance with subsection 4.4(c) its Applicable Percentage of such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for any such reduction suffered. Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph (b), no Lender shall be entitled to demand compensation pursuant to this paragraph (b) if it shall not then be the general practice of such Lender or such corporation to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other comparable credit agreements.
(c) A certificate of each Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or such corporation as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, and setting forth in reasonable detail an explanation of the basis of requesting such compensation in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) above, including calculations in detail comparable to the detail set forth in Certificates delivered to such Lender in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other comparable credit agreements, shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Borrower, as required by paragraph (a) or (b) above, shall pay each Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered to it within ten days after its receipt of the same.
(d) Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to such period or any other period, except that no Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this subsection 4.4 for any such costs incurred or any such reduction suffered with respect to any date unless such Lender shall have notified the Borrowers that it will demand compensation for such costs or reductions under paragraph (c) above, not more than six months after the later of (i) such date and (ii) the date on which such Lender shall
 
have become aware of such costs or reductions. The protection of this subsection 4.4 shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change or condition that shall have occurred or been imposed.
(e) For purposes of this subsection, the term "Lender" shall include any Issuing Bank. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
4.5. . (a) Except as required by applicable law, all payments made by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority (other than Excluded Taxes). If any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees deductions or withholdings (other than Excluded Taxes) (together with any interest, additions to tax and penalties applicable thereto, "") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable by a Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement. Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by a Borrower, such Borrower shall timely pay such Non-Excluded Taxes and shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by such Borrower showing payment thereof. If the applicable Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, such Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Borrower shall not be required to make any payments in respect of Non-Excluded Taxes to any Lender that has changed the Funding Office at which it maintains the Extensions of Credit to which such Non-Excluded Taxes relate (other than any such change in Funding Office made by such Lender pursuant to subsection 4.7 to avoid or minimize the application or effects of subsection 4.4 or 4.5) in an amount greater than such Borrower would have been required to pay pursuant to this subsection 4.5 if no such change in Funding Office had occurred. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

of withholding, that (except in the case of taxes imposed by the United States or Germany that are in effect as of the date hereof) such Lender has received written notice from a Borrower advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company, any other relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company, any other relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company, any other relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements, provided such Lender is legally able to do so and provided that (except in the case of taxes imposed by the United States or Germany that are in effect as of the date hereof) such Lender has received written notice from a Borrower advising it of the availability of any exemption from such backup withholding or information reporting requirements and supplying all applicable documentation.

Exhibit E
(B) deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent two further current copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Company; and
(C) obtain such extensions of time for filing and complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent;
unless in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the
 
Company and the Administrative Agent of the legal basis therefor. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a Participant pursuant to subsection 11.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms and statements required pursuant to this subsection, that in the case of a Participant such Participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased.

For purposes of this subsection 4.5(b)(iii), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date hereof.
(iv) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this subsection 4.5(b) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall (x) timely update such form or certification, or (y) promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(c) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority (but, in the case of any Non-Excluded Taxes for which an additional amount is payable by a Borrower under this subsection 4.5, only to the extent that the applicable Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Non-Excluded Taxes and without limiting the obligation of a Borrower to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this subsection 4.5(c) shall be paid within ten days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this subsection 4.5(c).
(d) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender receives a refund of any Non-Excluded Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which
 
any Loan Party has paid additional amounts, in each case pursuant to this subsection 4.5, it shall pay to the Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this subsection 4.5 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that the Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (d), in no event will the Administrative Agent or such Lender be required to pay any amount to a Loan Party pursuant to this paragraph (d) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-tax position than the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph (d) shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Loan Party or any other Person.

Such loss or reasonable expense shall be equal to the sum of (i) such Lender's actual costs and expenses incurred (other than any lost profits) in connection with, or by reason of, any of the foregoing events and (ii) an amount equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such Lender of (A) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted or continued (assumed to be the Eurocurrency Rate applicable thereto) for the period from and including the date for such payment, prepayment, conversion or continuation to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan over (B) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid, converted or continued for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts, including calculations in reasonable detail, that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this subsection 4.6 shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

In the event that at any time the Company determines that the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Exposure exceeds the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Commitments or the aggregate amount of the Available Foreign Currency Exposure exceeds the Available Foreign Currency Exposure Cap, in either case by more than 5%, each Borrower will, as soon as practicable but in any event within five Business Days of making such determination, make such

repayments or prepayments of Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Loans made to such Borrower as shall be necessary to cause the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Exposure to no longer exceed the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Commitments or the aggregate amount of the Available Foreign Currency Exposure to no longer exceed the Available Foreign Currency Exposure Cap, as applicable. In the event that at any time the aggregate amount of the US Tranche Revolving Exposure exceeds the US Tranche Revolving Commitments, the Company will forthwith make such repayments or prepayments of US Tranche Revolving Loans as shall be necessary to cause the aggregate amount of the US Tranche Revolving Exposure to no longer exceed the US Tranche Revolving Commitments.
(b) The Administrative Agent will calculate the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Exposure (including the aggregate amount of L/C Obligations) and Available Foreign Currency Exposure (including the aggregate amount of L/C Obligations denominated in any Available Foreign Currency) from time to time, and in any event not less frequently than once during each calendar week. In making such calculations, the Administrative Agent will rely on the information most recently received by it from Issuing Banks in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit (including, with respect to such Issuing Banks, the conversion ratios in respect of the non-Dollar denominated Letters of Credit provided to the Administrative Agent by such Issuing Banks on the fifteenth day and the end of each month (or on the Business Day next succeeding such days)). Upon making each such calculation, the Administrative Agent will inform the Company of the results thereof and, upon the request of any Lender, inform such Lender of the results thereof.
(c) In the event that on any date the Administrative Agent calculates that the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Exposure exceeds the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Commitments or the aggregate amount of the Available Foreign Currency Exposure exceeds the Available Foreign Currency Exposure Cap, in either case by more than 5%, the Administrative Agent will give notice to such effect to the Company. Within five Business Days after receipt of any such notice, each Borrower will, as soon as practicable but in any event within five Business Days of receipt of such notice, make such repayments or prepayments of Loans made to such Borrower as shall be necessary to cause the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Exposure to no longer exceed the Multicurrency Tranche Revolving Commitments or the aggregate amount of the Available Foreign Currency Exposure to no longer exceed the Available Foreign Currency Exposure Cap, as applicable.
(d) Any prepayment required to be made pursuant to this subsection 4.8 shall be accompanied by payment of amounts payable, if any, pursuant to subsection 4.6 in respect of the amount so prepaid.

equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Party on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors liable for such Obligation (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 5.13, the date of the supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Party making any payment to a Claiming Party pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall (subject to Section 3.03) be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under Section 3.01 to the extent of such payment.
SECTION 3.03. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent to do so would not constitute unlawful financial assistance, the Guarantors shall have no rights under Sections 3.01 and 3.02 and shall not exercise any other rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise until all of the payment in full in cash of the Obligations owed by the Loan Party against whom the Guarantor would otherwise have rights under Section 3.01 or 3.02. No failure on the part of the Company or any Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 3.01 and 3.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
Limitations, Subordination
Each Guarantor represents and warrants that the execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action and, if required, action by the holders of such Guarantor's Capital Stock, and that this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Guarantor and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
SECTION 5.01. . All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in subsection 11.2 of the Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Subsidiary Loan Party shall be given to it in care of the Company as provided in subsection 11.2 of the Credit Agreement.
Notices
 
SECTION 5.02. . (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Credit Party in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Credit Parties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 5.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Waivers; Amendment
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with subsections 11.1 of the Credit Agreement.
SECTION 5.03. . (a) The parties hereto agree that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement of its expenses incurred hereunder as provided in subsection 11.5 of the Credit Agreement.
Administrative Agent's Fees and Expenses; Indemnification
(b) Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other Loan Documents, each Guarantor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and the other Indemnitees against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by any Guarantor arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
provided
(c) Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Obligations subject to the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 5.03 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the
 
termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party. All amounts due under this Section 5.03 shall be payable on written demand therefor.
SECTION 5.04. . Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any Guarantor or the Administrative Agent that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns.
Successors and Assigns
SECTION 5.05. . All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Credit Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any Credit Party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Credit Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under any Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
Survival of Agreement
SECTION 5.06. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Loan Party when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Loan Party shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly provided in this Agreement or the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Loan Party and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Loan Party without the approval of any other Loan Party and without affecting the obligations of any other Loan Party hereunder.
Counterparts; Effectiveness; Several Agreement
 
SECTION 5.07. . Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. All rights, remedies and powers provided in this Agreement may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provision of law, and all the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law that may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they shall not render this Agreement invalid, unenforceable, in whole or in part, or not entitled to be recorded, registered or filed under the provisions of any applicable law.
Severability; Limitation by Law
SECTION 5.08. . If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Credit Party is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Credit Party to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against any of and all the obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement owed to such Credit Party, irrespective of whether or not such Credit Party shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Credit Party agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Credit Party, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Credit Party under this Section 5.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Credit Party may have.
Right of Set-Off

Each of the Loan Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
 
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Guarantor, or their respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
(c) Each of the Loan Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 5.09. Each of the Loan Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 5.01. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
SECTION 5.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).
