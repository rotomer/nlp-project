Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. At the 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, held on May 24, 2007, the shareholders of Hasbro, Inc. (the "Company") approved amendments to the Company's 2003 Stock Incentive Performance Plan (the "Plan") which (i) increased the maximum number of total shares of common stock which may be delivered pursuant to awards under the Plan by 7,500,000 shares, (ii) of the additional 7,500,000 shares authorized for awards under the Plan, increased the number of shares of stock which may be delivered pursuant to awards other than stock options or SARS, by 3,000,000 shares, (iii) extended the expiration date of the Plan from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2010, (iv) clarified that the Plan does not allow for liberal share counting, such that (A) shares of common stock tendered in payment of an award's exercise price, shares withheld to pay taxes, and shares repurchased by the Company using option proceeds may not be added back into the authorized pool of shares eligible for grant pursuant to the Plan and (B) the gross number of shares covered by SARS, as opposed to only the net number actually delivered upon settlement of SARS, count against the authorized number of shares available under the Plan, and (v) added a limitation to the Plan that no award may have a term longer than ten years from the date of grant Effective May 24, 2007 the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee") granted stock options to the Company's executive officers and certain other employees of the Company. These option awards were all made under the Plan, as amended at the 2007 Shareholders Meeting. All option grants to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers were reviewed and approved by the Company's full Board of Directors. All of the options granted on May 24, 2007 are non-qualified stock options (the "Options") similar to the options the Company has granted in recent years. These Options have an exercise price equal to $32.425 per share, which was the fair market value (as computed under the Plan) of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The Options vest in three equal cumulative installments on the first three anniversaries of the date of grant and expire seven years from the date of grant. The Company has previously filed the form of fair market value non-qualified stock option agreement under the Plan with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Options granted on May 24, 2007 to the Company's named executive officers covered the following numbers of shares of common stock: Alfred J. Verrecchia, 368,664 shares; Brian Goldner, 122,888 shares; David D.R. Hargreaves, 80,645 shares; and Barry Nagler, 54,724 shares. Item 8.01 Other Events.
