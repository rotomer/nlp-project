     This report contains forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to an uncompleted securities offering. These statements are subject to completion of the securities offering. Completion of the securities offering requires, among other things, the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement, including the absence of a material adverse change to Hasbro, Inc., and other customary conditions. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and Hasbro, Inc. will not undertake efforts to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after this date.

Base Prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities. Such Registration Statement, including any amendments thereto filed prior to the Execution Time, became effective upon filing and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act has been received by the Company. No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued by the Commission and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering has been initiated or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened by the Commission. The Company may have filed with the Commission, as part of an amendment to the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 424(b), one or more preliminary prospectus supplements relating to the Securities, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company will file with the Commission a final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities in accordance with Rule 424(b). As filed, such final prospectus supplement shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder, and shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Base Prospectus and any Preliminary Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein. The Registration Statement, at the Execution Time, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x).
     (b) On each Effective Date, the Registration Statement did, and when the Final Prospectus is first filed in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date (as defined herein), the Final Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) will, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules thereunder; on each Effective Date and at the Execution Time, the Registration Statement did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; on the Effective Date and on the Closing Date the Indenture did or will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules thereunder; and on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , , that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof.

The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof.
     (d) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption in Rule 163, and (iv) at the Execution Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (iv)), the Company was or is (as the case may be) a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405. The Company agrees to pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).

     (d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of any such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its reasonable efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.

     (g) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     (h) The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company or the Underwriters with the Commission or retained by the Company or the Underwriters under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto and any electronic road show.

     (i) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, on any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day following the Closing Date.
     (j) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
 
     (k) The Company agrees to pay the costs and expenses relating to the following matters: (i) the preparation, printing or reproduction and filing with the Commission of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits thereto), each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and each amendment or supplement to any of them; (ii) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of the Registration Statement, each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and all amendments or supplements to any of them, as may, in each case, be reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities; (iii) the preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the Securities, including any stamp or transfer taxes in connection with the original issuance and sale of the Securities; (iv) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement, any blue sky memorandum and all other agreements or documents printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Securities; (v) any registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of the several states (including filing fees and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters relating to such registration and qualification); (vi) any filings required to be made with the NASD, Inc.

          6. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

     (d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chief Executive Officer or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus and any supplements or amendments thereto, as well as each electronic road show used in connection with the offering of the Securities, and this Agreement and that:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and

     (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
          8. .
Indemnification and Contribution
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who
 
controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities under the heading "Underwriting," (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances under the heading "Underwriting" and (iii) the paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in the any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such
 
failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
     (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant
provided
however
 
equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
          9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

          11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase today by the Underwriters pursuant to the underwriting agreement dated September 12, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and you, as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule I of the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.30% Notes due 2017 (the "Securities"), issued pursuant to the indenture dated as of March 15, 2000, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of September 17, 2007 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of Nova Scotia Trust Company of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"). This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement. Capitalized terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are used herein with the meanings so defined.
We have examined signed copies of the registration statement of the Company on Form S-3 (No. 333-145947) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on September 11, 2007, all documents incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits to said registration statement; the Prospectus dated September 11, 2007, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated September 11, 2007 and the Prospectus Supplement dated September 12, 2007 filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"); an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement; an executed copy of the Indenture; and the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 filed as an exhibit to the Registration
 
Statement. The Underwriting Agreement, the Securities and the Indenture are collectively referred to herein as the "Company Agreements."
We have also examined and relied upon the original or copies of (i) the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, as certified as of a recent date by the Secretary of the State of Rhode Island (the "Articles of Incorporation"), (ii) a certificate dated as of a recent date of the Secretary of State of the State of Rhode Island as to the good standing of the Company under the laws of the State of Rhode Island, (iii) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, (iv) such records of corporate proceedings as we deemed material, and (v) the documents delivered on the date hereof in connection with the closing of the sale of Securities to you. We have assumed the genuineness of the signatures on all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the corresponding originals of all documents submitted to us as copies.
We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act, the federal laws of the United States of America and, for purposes of our opinion in paragraphs 4 and 5 below, the laws of the State of New York.
Insofar as this opinion relates to factual matters, information with respect to which is in the possession of the Company, we have made inquiries to the extent we believe reasonable with respect to such matters and have relied upon representations made by the Company in the Underwriting Agreement and representations made to us by one or more officers of the Company.
For purposes of our opinion expressed in paragraph 1, we have relied exclusively on a certificate of public officials in the State of Rhode Island.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Rhode Island.
2. The Company has corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Company Agreements.
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
4. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and general principles of equity; and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
5. The Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that the Securities have been duly authenticated by the Trustee in the manner
 
prescribed by the Indenture, are valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and general principles of equity.
6. All consents, approvals and authorizations of any federal court or governmental authority or agency or the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act that are required to be obtained in connection with the offer, issuance, sale and delivery of the Securities have been obtained.
7. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Company Agreements and the issuance and sale of the Securities will not (i) violate any provision of the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act, the federal laws of the United States or the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company, (ii) breach or result in a default under any of the agreements identified as exhibits to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 or in any subsequent Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filed with the Commission prior to the date hereof, or (iii) to our knowledge, violate any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any federal court, arbitrator, governmental body, agency or official specifically naming the Company.
8. The Company is not, and upon the issuance and sale of the Securities and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus will not be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
9. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act; any required filing of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus required by Rule 424(b) under the Act has been made in the manner and within the time periods required by Rule 424(b).
This opinion is furnished by us to you solely for your benefit and may not be relied on by any person other than you.

Re:
Hasbro, Inc.  6.30% Notes due 2017
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We refer to the underwriting agreement dated September 12, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation (the "Company") and you as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement. We have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the transactions described therein. Capitalized terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are used herein with the meanings so defined.
In the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, as counsel to the Company we participated in conferences with officers and representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent accountants for the Company and your representatives and counsel at which conferences the contents of these documents were discussed. On the basis of information that we have gained in the course of our representation of the Company and our participation in the discussions referred to above, we confirm to you (i) that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Final Prospectus, as of its date, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the documents incorporated by reference into the Final Prospectus, when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (ii) we do not know of any legal or governmental proceeding to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party required to be described in the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus which is not so described or of any contracts, agreements or other documents that the Company is required to file with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act that have not been filed as required. In addition, based on the information and participation described above, no facts that have come to our attention have caused us to believe
 
that the (i) Registration Statement, as of its Effective Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Disclosure Package, as of the Execution Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Final Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except in each case that we express no belief with respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference in any of the foregoing.
The purpose of our engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters set forth in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the documents incorporated by reference therein, and we have not undertaken any obligation to verify independently any of the factual matters set forth in those documents. Moreover, many of the determinations required to be made in the preparation of such documents involve matters primarily of a non-legal nature. Because of the limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of the determinations involved in such review, we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the documents incorporated by reference therein, except for those statements in the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes," "Description of the Debt Securities," "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Underwriting" insofar as they represent descriptions or conclusions of United States law, descriptions of securities or summaries of documents referred to therein, which fairly summarize in all material respects such descriptions, conclusions or documents.
This letter is furnished by us to you solely for your benefit and may not be relied on by any person other than you.
Very truly yours,
Ropes & Gray LLP
