Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 21, 2008, we announced our financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2008, and certain other financial information. The press release, which has been attached as Exhibit 99, discloses a financial measure, Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management believes that EBITDA is one of the appropriate measures for evaluating our operating performance, because it reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, t o invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and make strategic acquisitions. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as more fully discussed in our financial statements and filings with the SEC. The EBITDA measures included in our press release have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as is required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures.   
This press release also includes the Company's consolidated and International segment net revenues excluding the impact of exchange rates. Management believes that the presentation of consolidated and International segment net revenues excluding the impact of exchange rate changes provides information that is helpful to an investor's understanding of the underlying business performance absent exchange rate fluctuations which are beyond the Company's control.
As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Pawtucket, RI (July 21, 2008) -- Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE: HAS) today reported second quarter net revenues of $784.3 million, an increase of $92.9 million or 13% compared to $691.4 million a year ago, or an increase of 10%, excluding the favorable foreign exchange impact of $25.0 million.  The Company reported net earnings for the quarter of $37.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $4.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share in 2007.  The 2007 second quarter results included a final mark to market expense of $36.5 million or $0.21 per diluted share related to the repurchase of the Lucas warrants.  Excluding the final Lucas mark to market expense, earnings for the second quarter of 2007 would have been $41.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share.
 "We are very pleased with our second quarter and first half performance," said Brian Goldner, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "The current strength of our product line is allowing us to invest in our future growth by developing our business in emerging markets, in entertainment and in digital gaming, while continuing to deliver strong earnings."   
U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the quarter were $467.7 million, an increase of $45.8 million or 11% compared to $421.9 million in 2007.  The growth in revenue is attributable to INDIANA JONES, STAR WARS and the MARVEL product lines, as well as growth in core brands including NERF, G.I. JOE, EASY-BAKE OVEN and board games, including MONOPOLY and TRIVIAL PURSUIT. Additionally, TRANSFORMERS continued to contribute significantly to the segment in the quarter.  The U.S. and Canada segment reported an operating profit of $43.7 million.  This compares to $35.5 million of operating profit in 2007, which included a $10.4 million provision related to the EASY-BAKE OVEN product recall.
 
International segment net revenues for the quarter were $293.7 million, an increase of $38.5 million or 15% compared to $255.2 million in 2007.  The revenues include a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $23.4 million or 9%.  The results reflect growth in core brands including LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL, FURREAL FRIENDS, and board games, as well as INDIANA JONES and STAR WARS products.  Additionally, TRANSFORMERS and MARVEL continued to contribute significantly to the segment in the quarter.  The International segment reported an operating profit of $14.0 million, reflecting the investment spending in emerging markets, compared to $15.3 million in 2007.  
"I'm very pleased with the earnings we announced today, while input cost inflation continues to be challenging, thus far we have been able to mitigate most of the impact through cost savings initiatives and pricing actions," said David Hargreaves, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
During the quarter, the Company spent a total of $51.6 million to repurchase 1.646 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $31.36 per share.   As of quarter end, there was $402.2 million remaining in the current share repurchase authorization.

Such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual actions or results may differ materially from those expected or anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Specific factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limit ed to: the Company's ability to design, manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, as well as interest in and acceptance and purchase of those products by retail customers and consumers in quantities and at prices that will be sufficient to profitably recover development, manufacturing, marketing, royalty and other costs of products; economic and public health conditions in the various markets in which the Company and its customers and suppliers operate throughout the world, including factors which impact the retail market, disposable income or consumer demand for the Company's products, the Company's ability to manufacture and deliver products, higher fuel and other commodity prices, higher transportation costs and potential transportation delays, currency fluctuations and government regulation; the concentration of the Company's customers; the inventory policies of the Company's retail customers, including the concentration of the Company's reve nues in the second half and fourth quarter of the year, together with increased reliance by retailers on quick response inventory management techniques, which increases the risk of underproduction of popular items, overproduction of less popular items and failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules; work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, which may impact the Company's ability to manufacture or deliver product in a timely and cost-effective manner; the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Company's significant retailers which could negatively impact the Company's revenues or bad debt exposure; the impact of competition on revenues, margins and other aspects of the Company's business, including the ability to secure, maintain and renew popular licenses and the ability to attract and retain talented employees in a competitive environment; concentration of manufacturing for many of the Company's products in the People's Republic of China; the risk of product recalls or produc t liability suits; market conditions, third party actions or approvals and the impact of competition which could reduce demand for the Company's products or delay or increase the cost of implementation of the Company's programs or alter the Company's actions and reduce actual results; the risk that anticipated benefits of acquisitions may not occur or be delayed or reduced in their realization; and other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in the Company's public announcements and SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this release or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release.
This presentation includes a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), specifically EBITDA. As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliation on the attached schedule of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) represents net earnings excluding, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes that EBITDA is one of the appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because it reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet, and make strategic acquisitions. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance wit h GAAP as more fully discussed in the Company's financial statements and filings with the SEC. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  This presentation also includes the Company's Consolidated and International segment net revenues excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates.  Management believes that the presentation of Consolidated and International segment net revenues minus the impact of exchange rate changes provides information that is helpful to an investor's understanding of the underlying business performance absent exchange rate fluctuations which are beyond the Company's control.
