Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 23, 2012, Hasbro, Inc. (Hasbro or we) announced our financial results for the fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2012, and certain other financial information. The press release, attached as Exhibit 99.1, includes a financial measure, Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that EBITDA is one of the appropriate measures for evaluating our operating performance, because it reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and make strategic acquisitions. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in our financial statements and filings with the SEC. The EBITDA measures included in the press release have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as is required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures.     
The press release also includes our Consolidated and International segment net revenues excluding the impact of exchange rate changes. Management believes that the presentation of the Consolidated and International segment net revenues minus the impact of exchange rate changes provides information that is helpful to an investor's understanding of the segment's underlying business performance absent exchange rate fluctuations which are beyond our control.  Similarly, the press release includes Hasbro's first quarter 2012 net earnings excluding certain expenses related to severance costs. Management believes that the presentation of first quarter 2012 net earnings absent these amounts assists investors in understanding the comparability of the Company's results.  
As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
The information furnished in Item 2.02, including the Exhibit attached hereto,  shall not be deemed "filed" for any purpose, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.

Pawtucket, RI (April 23, 2012) -- Hasbro, Inc.
"Our first quarter 2012 results are consistent with the plan we previously communicated for the year," said Brian Goldner, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We continue to experience good momentum in our international business and positive point-of-sale trends in the U.S. and international markets.  We have launched several new initiatives for 2012 which are generating good early results.  We are looking forward to the four major motion pictures coming to global audiences in the next few months as well as the launch of our all important fall and holiday initiatives in the second half of the year."
"In partnership with our retailers and supported by a strong line of new fall initiatives, our expectation remains that a higher percentage of full year revenues will be in the second half of the year versus past years.  This shift in the timing of our business has a similar impact on profitability," continued Goldner.  "For the full year 2012, we continue to believe, absent the impact of foreign exchange, we will again grow revenues and earnings per share."
"As we previously outlined for you, we planned 2012 with the belief that our business would develop later in the year, more closely aligned with the timing of consumer demand and our international business," said Deborah Thomas, Chief Financial Officer.   "Importantly, in the U.S. and Canada segment, we are executing our plan to return the segment to historical operating profit levels.  This includes steps we have taken to right-size the organization, for which we have incurred the costs, and a planned higher level of spending in consumer-facing marketing and advertising.  In the first quarter 2012, operating profit was impacted by the lower revenue base in addition to $11.1 million in severance costs across the global organization and approximately $6 million associated with an extra week of expenses."
Major Segment Performance
U.S. and Canada segment net revenues were $329.0 million, a decrease of $62.2 million or 16%, compared to $391.2 million in 2011.  The results reflect growth in the Preschool category offset by declines in the other product categories.  The U.S. and Canada segment reported an operating profit of $14.4 million, compared to $41.0 million in 2011.  
International segment net revenues grew $35.4 million or 14% to $289.7 million, compared to $254.3 million in 2011.  Net revenues in the International segment grew 17% absent the negative $8.2 million impact of foreign exchange.  Revenue in the International segment reflects growth in the Boys and Games categories which more than offset flat revenues in the Preschool category and a decline in the Girls category. The International segment reported an operating loss of $5.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $1.7 million in 2011.
Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 19% to $29.3 million, compared to $24.6 million in 2011.  The segment benefited from the sale of television programming in the U.S. and internationally, as well as continued box office and licensed revenues related to TRANSFORMERS. The Entertainment and Licensing segment reported an operating profit of $7.7 million compared to $5.4 million in 2011.  
Product Category Performance
For the first quarter 2012, net revenues in the Boys category increased 4% to $302.8 million led by growth in entertainment-backed brands MARVEL and STAR WARS.  Additionally, KRE-O, Hasbro's new construction line, contributed to the year-over-year gains.  Following a strong 2011, BEYBLADE was essentially flat in the quarter.  Overall, TRANSFORMERS brand revenue was also flat in the quarter, but down in the Boys category.  The Preschool category grew 2% to $69.9 million supported by SESAME STREET and PLAYSKOOL RESCUE HEROES, including TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS.  
The increases in net revenues in the Boys and Preschool categories were offset by a 9% decline in the Games category to $181.9 million and an 18% decline in the Girls category to $93.2 million.  Despite declines in these categories several brands posted year-over-year growth.  In the Games category, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUEL MASTERS and BATTLESHIP posted revenue gains in the quarter.  Also contributing to the quarter were new games initiatives for 2012, including STAR WARS FIGHTER PODS and TRANSFORMERS BOT SHOTS, which launched during the quarter and are performing well.  In the Girls category, MY LITTLE PONY, which is now backed by television entertainment globally, posted growth in the quarter.  
Share Repurchase and Dividend
The Company repurchased a total of 139,656 shares of common stock during the first quarter 2012 at a total cost of $5.0 million and an average price of $35.80 per share.  At quarter end, $222.3 million remained available in the current share repurchase authorization.  The Company paid $38.6 million in cash dividends to shareholders during the quarter and on February 2, 2012 declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per common share, an increase of $0.06 per share, or 20%, from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.30 per common share.  The dividend will be payable on May 15, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 1, 2012.

Certain statements in this release contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include expectations concerning the Company's potential performance in 2012 and beyond, including with respect to its revenues and earnings per share, and the Company's ability to achieve its other financial and business goals and may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases. The Company's actual actions or results may differ materially from those expected or anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Specific factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company's ability to design, manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, as well as interest in and purchase of those products by retail customers and consumers in quantities and at prices that will be sufficient to profitably recover the Company's development, manufacturing, marketing, royalty and other costs; (ii) global economic conditions, including recessions, credit crises or other economic shocks or downturns which can negatively impact the retail and/or credit markets, the financial health of the Company's retail customers and consumers, and consumer and business confidence, and which can result in lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer spending, including lower spending on purchases of the Company's products; (iii) other factors which can lower discretionary consumer spending, such as higher costs for fuel and food, drops in the value of homes or other consumer assets, and high levels of consumer debt; (iv) other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which the Company and its customers and suppliers operate which impact the Company's ability and cost to manufacture and deliver products, such as higher fuel and other commodity prices, higher labor costs, higher transportation costs, outbreaks of disease which affect public health and the movement of people and goods, and other factors, including government regulations, which can create potential manufacturing and transportation delays or impact costs; (v) currency fluctuations, including movements in foreign exchange rates, which can lower the Company's net revenues and earnings, and significantly impact the Company's costs; (vi) the concentration of the Company's customers, potentially increasing the negative impact to the Company of difficulties experienced by any of the Company's customers or changes by the Company's customers in their purchasing or selling patterns; (vii) greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with the Company's investment in its joint venture with Discovery Communications, LLC, the rebranding of the joint venture network, development of Hasbro Studios, and the creation of new content to appear on the network and elsewhere; (viii) consumer interest in and acceptance of the joint venture network, and programming created by Hasbro Studios, and other factors impacting the financial performance of the joint venture and Hasbro Studios; (ix) greater than expected costs or unexpected delays or difficulties associated with the creation of Hasbro's Gaming Center of Excellence and the execution of the Company's strategy for driving innovation and immersive play experiences in its gaming business; (x) unexpected delays or difficulties in the Company's execution of its plans to drive growth and increased profitability in its U.S. and Canada business; (xi) the inventory policies of the Company's retail customers, including retailers' potential decisions to lower the inventories they are willing to carry, even if it results in lost sales, as well as the concentration of the Company's revenues in the second half and fourth quarter of the year, which coupled  with reliance by retailers on quick response inventory management techniques increases the risk of underproduction of popular items, overproduction of less popular items and failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules; (xii) work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, which may impact the Company's ability to manufacture or deliver product in a timely and cost-effective manner; (xiii) the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Company's significant retailers which could negatively impact the Company's revenues or bad debt exposure; (xiv) the impact of competition on revenues, margins and other aspects of the Company's business, including the ability to secure, maintain and renew popular licenses and the ability to attract and retain talented employees in a competitive environment; (xv) concentration of manufacturing for many of the Company's products in the People's Republic of China and the associated impact to the Company of public health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China, affecting the movement of products into and out of China, and impacting the cost of producing products in China and exporting them to other countries; (xvi) the risk of product recalls or product liability suits and costs associated with product safety regulations; (xvii) other market conditions, third party actions or approvals and the impact of competition which could reduce demand for the Company's products or delay or increase the cost of implementation of the Company's programs or alter the Company's actions and reduce actual results; (xviii) the risk that anticipated benefits of acquisitions may not occur or be delayed or reduced in their realization; and (xix) other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in the Company's public announcements and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this release or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release.
This press release includes a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules, specifically EBITDA.  EBITDA represents net earnings excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliation on the attached schedule of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that EBITDA is one of the appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because it reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet, and make strategic acquisitions. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in the Company's financial statements and filings with the SEC. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  This press release also includes the Company's Consolidated and International segment net revenues excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates.  Management believes that the presentation of Consolidated and International segment net revenues minus the impact of exchange rate changes provides information that is helpful to an investor's understanding of the underlying business performance absent exchange rate fluctuations which are beyond the Company's control.  Similarly, this press release includes the Company's first quarter 2012 net earnings excluding certain expenses related to severance costs. We provided the first quarter 2012 net earnings absent these amounts to assist investors in understanding the comparability of the Company's results.
