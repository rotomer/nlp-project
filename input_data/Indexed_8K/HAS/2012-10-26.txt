Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 25, 2012, Hasbro, Inc. (the "Company"), and its subsidiary Hasbro SA (together the "Borrowers"), entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Amended Agreement") with: (i) Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and a Lender, (ii) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., RBS Citizens, N.A., and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and book runners, and (iii) the other financial institutions party thereto from time to time.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Amended Agreement.  A copy of the Amended Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and the description set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Agreement.
The Amended Agreement amends and restates the Company's Revolving Credit Agreement, dated December 16, 2010.  Pursuant to the Amended Agreement the Borrowers increased their committed borrowing facility from $500 million to $700 million, extended the term of the facility through October 25, 2017 and reduced certain fees as described below.     
At the Borrowers' election, the interest rates per annum applicable to Committed Loans under the Amended Agreement will be computed either on a Base Rate or a Eurocurrency Rate, in each case with an applicable margin added to such underlying rate, the margin being based on the more favorable of the Company's debt rating and the ratio of the Company's Consolidated Total Funded Debt to Consolidated EBITDA.
The Base Rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus  of 1%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect by Bank of America as its prime rate and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate for a one-month interest period plus 1%.
The Eurocurrency Rate is measured by reference to an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate, or "LIBOR".
Based on the Company's current debt ratings of BBB+ by S&P, Baa2 by Moody's and BBB+ by Fitch, the current margin on Base Rate loans is 0.50% and on Eurocurrency Rate loans is 1.50% under the Amended Agreement.
The Company pays a commitment fee on the available unused committed borrowing capacity under the facility. The fee is based on the more favorable of the Company's debt rating and the ratio of the Company's Consolidated Total Funded Debt to Consolidated EDITDA. Under the Amended Agreement, the commitment fee to be paid by the Company based on the unused portion of the facility is reduced to 0.15% from 0.225% and the interest rate was amended to a Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.25% from Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.50% on borrowings under the facility.
The Amended Agreement provides for Swing Line Borrowings of up to $50 million and the issuance of letters of credit in aggregate combined amounts of up to $100 million.
The Amended Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants typical of this type of facility, including: (i) restrictions on the Company's and its domestic subsidiaries' ability to allow liens on their assets, (ii) restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, (iii) restrictions on the Borrowers' and certain of their subsidiaries' ability to engage in mergers or engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (iv) the requirement that the Company maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of no less than 3.50:1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter and (v) the requirement that the Company maintain a Consolidated Total Funded Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of no more than 3.00:1.00 at the end of the first, second and fourth fiscal quarters, or 3.50:1.00 at the end of the third fiscal quarter.  
The Company's obligations under the Amended Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its domestic subsidiaries.  Hasbro SA's obligations under the Amended Agreement are guaranteed by the Company.

Title:  Associate
                                                                        
1.
The Mandatory Cost (to the extent applicable) is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with:
(a)
the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions); or
(b)
the requirements of the European Central Bank.
2.
On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Administrative Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "") for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below.  The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.  The Administrative Agent will, at the request of any Borrower or any Lender, deliver to such Borrower or such Lender as the case may be, a statement setting forth the calculation of any Mandatory Cost.
Additional Cost Rate
3.
The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Administrative Agent.  This percentage will be certified by such Lender in its notice to the Administrative Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of such Lender's participation in all Loans made from such Lending Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of Loans made from that Lending Office.
4.
The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as follows:
(a)
in relation to any Loan in Sterling:
(b)
in relation to any Loan in any currency other than Sterling:
Where:
"A"
is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
"B"
is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Rate, the Mandatory Cost and any interest charged on overdue amounts pursuant to and, in the case of interest (other than on overdue amounts) charged at the Default Rate, without counting any increase in interest rate effected by the charging of the Default Rate) payable for the relevant Interest Period of such Loan.
Section 2.09(b)(i)
"C"
is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
"D"
is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
"E"
is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Lenders to the Administrative Agent pursuant to below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000.
paragraph 7
5.
For the purposes of this Schedule:
(a)
"" and "" have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;
Eligible Liabilities
Special Deposits
(b)
"" means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;
Fees Rules
(c)
"" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate); and
Fee Tariffs
(d)
"" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
Tariff Base
6.
In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages ( 5% will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05).  A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero.  The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
i.e.
7.
If requested by the Administrative Agent or any Borrower, each Lender with a Lending Office in the United Kingdom or a Participating Member State shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent and such Borrower, the rate of charge payable by such Lender to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by such Lender as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to such Lender for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of such Lender.
8.
Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate.  In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
(a)
the jurisdiction of the Lending Office out of which it is making available its participation in the relevant Loan; and
(b)
any other information that the Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
9.
The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Lender for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to and above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a lending office in the same jurisdiction as its Lending Office.
paragraphs 7
8
10.
The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over- or under-compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender pursuant to , and above is true and correct in all respects.
paragraphs 3

11.
The Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional Cost Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender pursuant to , and above.

12.
Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
13.
The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Borrowers and the Lenders, determine and notify to all parties any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
The Company has outstanding tax assessments from the Mexican tax authorities relating to the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.  These tax assessments, which currently total claims of approximately $190,890,000 in aggregate (including current interest, penalties, and inflation updates) at July 1, 2012 exchange rates, are based on transfer pricing issues between the Company's subsidiaries with respect to the Company's operations in Mexico. The Company has filed suit in the Federal Tribunal of Fiscal and Administrative Justice in Mexico challenging the 2000 through 2004 assessments and is challenging the 2005 assessment through administrative appeals.  In order to challenge the outstanding tax assessments related to 2000 through 2004, the Company was required to either make a deposit or post a bond in the full amount of the assessments. The Company elected to post bonds and accordingly, as of July 1, 2012, bonds totaling approximately $162,670,000 (at July 1, 2012 exchange rates) have been provided to the Mexican government related to the 2000 to 2004 assessments, allowing the Company to defend its positions. These bonds guarantee the full amounts of the related outstanding tax assessments in the event the Company is not successful in its challenge to them. The Company does not currently expect that it will be required to make a deposit or post a bond related to its administrative challenge to the 2005 assessment but may have to do so in the future if it is required as part of challenging this assessment.  Unless and until the transfer pricing issues and related tax matters are otherwise resolved, the Company anticipates that there will be similar tax assessments from the Mexican tax authorities for 2006 and following years, and a deposit or bond may be required related to future challenges to one or more of such assessments.
Pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, aggregate liabilities relating to the Mexican transfer pricing assessments during the term of the Agreement (including future assessments, interest, penalties and costs incurred during the term of the Agreement) up to US$350 million shall be within the disclosure exception contained in the provision of the Agreement to which this Schedule 5.06(b) relates.

Designated Borrower
Lenders
Guarantor
1.
 The Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, as a guaranty of payment and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise of any and all Obligations (as defined in that certain Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2012, among the Guarantor, the Designated Borrower, the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender (the "")) of Hasbro SA (the "").  All capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Credit Agreement.  The Administrative Agent's and Lenders' books and records showing the amount of the Hasbro SA Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and, absent demonstrable error, shall be prima facie evidence for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Hasbro SA Obligations.  To the extent permitted by law, this Amended and Restated Continuing Guaranty (the "") shall not be affected by the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Hasbro SA Obligations against the Designated Borrower or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Hasbro SA Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Hasbro SA Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty (other than a defense of payment or performance), and, to the extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing (other than a defense of payment or performance).

2.
 The Guarantor represents and warrants that it is organized and resident in the United States of America.  The Guarantor shall make all payments hereunder in the manner set forth in Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement, as if such Section were applicable to payment by the Guarantor hereunder.  The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Hasbro SA Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.  To the extent permitted by law, the obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any acts of any legislative body or governmental authority affecting the Designated Borrower (but not the Guarantor), including but not limited to, any restrictions on the conversion of currency or repatriation or control of funds or any total or partial expropriation of the Designated Borrower's property, or by economic, political, regulatory or other events in the countries where the Designated Borrower is located.
No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments.
3.
 The Guarantor consents and agrees that the Administrative Agent and Lenders may, to the extent permitted by law, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof:  (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Hasbro SA Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Hasbro SA Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Hasbro SA Obligations.  
Rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.
4.
 To the extent permitted by law, the Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Designated Borrower or any other guarantor (other than a defense of payment or performance), or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of the Administrative Agent or any Lender but excluding payment or performance) of the liability of the Designated Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that the Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Designated Borrower; (c) any right to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to proceed against the Designated Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Indebtedness, or pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent's or any Lender's power whatsoever; (d) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender; and (e) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties (other than a defense of payment or performance).  The Guarantor expressly waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Hasbro SA Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Hasbro SA Obligations, except, in each case, for notices expressly required under the Credit Agreement.
Certain Waivers.
5.
.  The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Hasbro SA Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Designated Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.
Hasbro SA Obligations Independent
6.
 The Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Hasbro SA Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid in full and any Commitments of the Lenders are terminated.  If any amounts are paid to the Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to reduce the amount of the Hasbro SA Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
Subrogation.
7.
 This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Hasbro SA Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Commitments of the Lenders are terminated, no Letter of Credit remains outstanding and the Loans and any other Hasbro SA Obligations that are then accrued and payable have been paid in full.  At such time as the Loans, the L/C Borrowings and the other Hasbro SA Obligations then due and owing shall have been paid in full, the Commitments have been terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding, this Agreement and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive termination) of the Guarantor shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by and party.  At the request of the Guarantor following any such termination, the Administrative Agent shall execute such documents as such Guarantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Designated Borrower or the Guarantor is made, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Hasbro SA Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Administrative Agent is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.  The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.
Termination; Reinstatement.
8.
 The Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of the Designated Borrower owing to the Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of the Designated Borrower to the Guarantor as subrogee of the Administrative Agent and Lenders or resulting from the Guarantor's performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Hasbro SA Obligations.  
Subordination.
9.
 In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Hasbro SA Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against the Designated Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Administrative Agent.
Stay of Acceleration.
10.
.  The Guarantor shall pay on demand all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of a single domestic firm and, if reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, a single foreign firm, of counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, unless a conflict exists, in which case, reasonable fees and expenses of reasonably necessary additional counsel for the affected Lender(s) shall be covered) in any way relating to the enforcement or protection of the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' rights under this Guaranty, including any incurred during any "workout" or restructuring in respect of the Hasbro SA Obligations.  The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Hasbro SA Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.
Expenses
11.
 No provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by the Administrative Agent and the Guarantor.  No failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.  The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity.  The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein.  Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Guarantor in writing, this Guaranty is not intended to supersede or otherwise affect any other guaranty now or hereafter given by the Guarantor for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any term or provision thereof, other than any guaranty given by the Guarantor pursuant to that certain Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of June 23, 2006, by and among the Guarantor and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent for itself and the other Lenders.
Miscellaneous.
12.
 The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Designated Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Designated Borrower and any such other guarantor as the Guarantor requires, and that the Administrative Agent and Lenders have no duty, and the Guarantor is not relying on the Administrative Agent or any Lender at any time, to disclose to the Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Designated Borrower or any other guarantor (the guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent and Lenders to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).
Condition of Designated Borrower.

 If and to the extent an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a) of the Credit Agreement has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may setoff and charge from time to time any amount so due against any or all of the Guarantor's accounts or deposits with the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity.
