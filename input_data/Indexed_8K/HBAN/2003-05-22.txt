Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 20, 2003
      Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; www.huntington.com) today filed its amended 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A and 2003 first quarter Form 10-Q.
COLUMBUS, Ohio
     Huntington had announced on April 16, 2003, its intent to restate prior period earnings resulting from the reclassification of its entire $3.2 billion portfolio of automobile leases from direct financing leases to operating leases. However, in reliance on an announcement made by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the May 15, 2003 meeting of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force regarding an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, , Huntington added an endorsement to one of its residual value insurance policies that permits it to account for the leases insured by that policy as direct financing leases rather than operating leases. As a result, $0.9 billion of automobile leases as of December 31, 2002, as well as all future originations, are now properly accounted for as direct financing leases. The remaining $2.3 billion of auto leases as of December 31, 2002, are accounted for as operating leases with this reflected in the amended 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A and 2003 first quarter Form 10-Q filed today. This action resulted in previously announced 2003 first quarter earnings being increased from $0.37 to $0.38 per share, and the cumulative negative impact of the reclassification on December 31, 2002 equity increasing from $3.2 million to $13.3 million.
Accounting for Leases
     "Our ability to account for essentially all automobile leases originated since May of last year, as well as all future production, as direct financing leases is a positive development," said Thomas Hoaglin, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "As noted in our April 16, 2003 announcement, over the life of the lease there is no difference in cash flows or earnings whether leases are accounted for as direct financing leases or operating leases. However, operating lease accounting changes significantly how these results appear in our financial
 
statements and some of our performance metrics. These developments now permit the $2 billion of operating leases simply to run-off over time."
     "On April 16, 2003, we provided earnings guidance of $1.47-$1.51 per share commensurate with the restatement of our entire automobile lease portfolio to operating leases," he continued. "Given the smaller portion of automobile leases now being reclassified to operating leases, our expectations for 2003 full-year earnings are $1.48-$1.52 per share."
