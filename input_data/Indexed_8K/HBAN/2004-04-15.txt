EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 15, 2004
     COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; www.huntington.com) reported 2004 first quarter earnings of $104.2 million, or $0.45 per common share, up 14% and 15%, respectively, from $91.7 million and $0.39 per common share in the year-ago quarter. Compared with 2003 fourth quarter net income of $93.3 million and $0.40 per common share, 2004 first quarter earnings were up 12% and 13%, respectively.
     "We are very pleased with first quarter performance," said Thomas E. Hoaglin, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "Underlying loan and lease growth was strong and core deposits excluding retail CDs were stable, a reversal from the fourth quarter's net outflow. As part of our continuing strategy to lower our exposure to the automobile financing sector, we sold more automobile loans. Further, our underlying credit quality indicators improved with non-performing assets remaining relatively stable."
     "While average reported total loans and leases increased only an annualized 2% from the 2003 fourth quarter, the full quarter impact of the sale of $1.0 billion of auto loans in the fourth quarter and partial quarter impact from a first quarter $868 million auto loan sale reduced this growth rate by 12%," he continued. "Adjusting for these auto loan sales, first quarter average total loans and leases would have increased at a strong 14% annualized rate, which represents a better depiction of the underlying growth rate during the quarter. Average residential mortgage and home equity loans increased an annualized 28% and 22%, respectively. Commercial real estate loans in both the middle market and small business also contributed to the growth, as did small business commercial loans. However, demand for middle-market commercial loans remained weak as average balances declined slightly from the fourth quarter though we were encouraged to see some growth late in the quarter."
     "As part of our continuing strategy to lower our exposure to the automobile financing sector, we sold $868 million of auto loans during the quarter. We have now sold auto loans in four of the last five quarters for a total of $3.0 billion. As a result, we further lowered our overall credit
 
exposure to this sector to 24%, down from 28% at the end of last year and 33% at the end of 2002. Our goal is to reduce this exposure to 20%, which we are beginning to approach. The first quarter sale resulted in a $9.0 million pre-tax gain that added three cents to earnings per share. We expect to continue to originate and sell auto loans to manage our auto loan exposure."
     "Average core deposits excluding retail CDs increased slightly from the fourth quarter and represented a reversal of fourth quarter net outflows. Growing deposits remains one of our priorities."
Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons
(1) Favorable (unfavorable) impact on GAAP earnings
     Significant 2004 first quarter performance highlights compared with 2003 fourth quarter included:
 
Discussion of Performance
     Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $21.9 million, or 11%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of an 18% increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 27 basis point, or an effective 7%, decline in the net interest margin. The fully taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.36% from 3.63% primarily reflecting the strategic repositioning of portfolios away from automobile loans and toward lower rate, and lower risk, residential real estate-related loans and investment securities.
     Compared with the 2003 fourth quarter, fully taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $1.6 million, reflecting the adverse impact of automobile loan sales. The fully taxable equivalent net interest margin declined 6 basis points, or an effective 2%, to 3.36% from 3.42%. Average earnings assets, despite the negative impact from the sale of automobile loans, increased $0.5 billion, or 2%. The decline in the net interest margin from the fourth quarter reflected the same factors as those impacting the decrease from the 2003 first quarter.
     Average loans and leases increased $2.6 billion, or 14%, from the 2003 first quarter almost entirely due to a 25% increase in average consumer loans. Contributing to the consumer loan growth was a $0.9 billion, or 23%, increase in average total automobile loans and leases reflecting the impact of consolidation of a securitization trust and the migration of leases from operating lease assets to direct financing leases, partially offset by loan sales; a $0.8 billion, or 46%, increase in average residential mortgages; and a $0.6 billion, or 20%, increase in average home equity loans.
     Average total commercial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans increased $0.2 billion, or 2%, reflecting a 12% increase in small business C&I and CRE loans and 10% increase in middle-market CRE loans. Average middle-market C&I loans were down 6% from the year-ago period and reflected, in part, weak demand, but also the impact from continued strategies to specifically lower exposure to large individual commercial credits, including shared national credits.
     On March 29, 2004, $868 million of automobile loans were sold resulting in a $9.0 million pre-tax gain. Combined with the $2.1 billion of sales in 2003, this brought the total automobile loans sold over the last five quarters to $3.0 billion. The current quarter sale represented a continuation of a strategy to lower exposure to automobile financing to around 20% of total credit exposure (see table below). At March 31, 2004, this exposure was $5.4 billion, down from $6.2 billion at year-end and represented a 24% exposure, down from 28% at year end 2003, and down from 33% at the end of 2002.
 
     Average total loans and leases in the first quarter increased only slightly from the 2003 fourth quarter, as the growth rate was mitigated by a $932 million reduction in average automobile loans related to 2003 fourth quarter and 2004 first quarter loan sales. These auto loan sales also were reflected in a $0.3 billion, or 6%, decline in average automobile loans and leases from the fourth quarter. Growth in mortgage-related consumer loans remained strong with average residential mortgages up $0.2 billion, or 7%, and average home equity loans up $0.2 billion, or 5%. Total average C&I and CRE loans were up slightly from the fourth quarter reflecting a 1% increase in small business C&I and CRE loans and a 2% increase in middle market CRE loans. Average middle-market C&I loans declined slightly.
     Average investment securities increased $1.8 billion, or 54%, from the year-ago quarter, and were up $0.6 billion, or 13%, from the fourth quarter primarily reflecting the investment of a portion of the proceeds from the automobile loan sales. Average mortgages held for sale decreased $0.3 billion, or 55%, from the year-ago quarter.
     Average total core deposits in the first quarter were $15.5 billion, including $2.4 billion of retail CDs. This compared with $15.0 billion in average total core deposits, including $3.0 billion in average retail CDs in the year-ago quarter, and $15.5 billion in average total core deposits, including $2.5 billion of retail CDs, in the 2003 fourth quarter. Average total core deposits excluding retail CDs were up $1.1 billion, or 9%, from the year-ago quarter. Compared with the fourth quarter's 1% net outflow, average total core deposits excluding retail CDs increased slightly in the 2004 first quarter, primarily due to a $0.1 billion, or 2%, increase in interest bearing demand deposits.
     Non-interest income decreased $45.3 million, or 17%, from the year-ago quarter. Comparisons with prior-period results are heavily influenced by the decline in operating leases and the related decline in operating lease income. These trends are expected to continue as all leases originated since April 2002 are direct financing leases where the income is reflected in net interest income, not non-interest income. Reflecting the run-off of the operating lease portfolio, operating lease income declined $49.3 million, or 36%, from the 2003 first quarter quarter. Excluding operating lease income, non-interest income increased $4.0 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter with the primary drivers being:
Partially offset by:
 
     Compared with the 2003 fourth quarter, non-interest income declined $18.9 million, or 8%. This comparison is also heavily influenced by the decline in operating lease income for the reasons noted above. Reflecting the run-off of the operating lease portfolio, operating lease income declined $16.4 million, or 16%, from the 2003 fourth quarter. Excluding operating lease income, non-interest income decreased $2.4 million, or 2%, from the 2003 fourth quarter with the primary drivers being:
Partially offset by:
     Non-interest expense decreased $29.8 million, or 9%, from the year-ago quarter. Comparisons with prior-period results are influenced by the decline in operating lease expense as the operating lease portfolio continues to run-off (see above operating lease income discussion). Operating lease expense declined $40.9 million, or 37%, from the 2003 first quarter. Excluding operating lease expense, non-interest expense increased $11.1 million, or 5%, from the year-ago quarter with the primary drivers being:
 
Partially offset by:
     Compared with the 2003 fourth quarter, non-interest expense declined $31.8 million, or 10%. Comparisons with prior-period results are also heavily influenced by the decline in operating lease expense. Operating lease expense declined $14.9 million, or 17%, from the 2003 fourth quarter. Excluding operating lease expense, non-interest expense decreased $16.9 million, or 7%, from the fourth quarter with the primary drivers being:
Partially offset by:
Credit Quality
     Net charge-offs for the 2004 first quarter were $28.6 million, or an annualized 0.53% of average total loans and leases. This decreased from $32.8 million, or 0.69%, in the year-ago quarter and from $55.1 million, or an annualized 1.03% of average total loans and leases in the prior quarter. Net charge-offs in the current and 2003 fourth quarter were increased by one-time events.
     Over the last several years, insurance policies were purchased by our automobile lending business to protect the company from a loss in the event a repossessed vehicle had physical damage. Claims paid under the policies were recorded as a reduction of credit losses. During the quarter, it was determined that these insurance policies do not provide economic transfer of risk to permit this accounting treatment. As a result, first quarter provision expense included a
 
$4.7 million one-time cumulative increase related to automobile loan and lease charge-offs to correct this error. The 0.53% net charge-off ratio for average total loans and leases for the first quarter included 8 basis points related to this adjustment.
     The 2003 fourth quarter net charge-offs included $26.6 million in C&I and CRE net charge-offs associated with the sale of $99 million of lower quality loans, including $43 million of non-performing assets (NPAs). This increased reported 2003 fourth quarter annualized net charge-offs for total loans and leases by 50 basis points and total commercial net charge-offs by 111 basis points.
     Total commercial (C&I and CRE) net charge-offs in the first quarter were $7.6 million, or an annualized 0.32% of related loans, down from $15.5 million, or an annualized 0.66% in the year-ago quarter. Total commercial net charge-offs in the 2003 fourth quarter were $36.9 million, or an annualized 1.55%, including 1.11% associated with the sale of lower quality commercial loans.
     Total consumer net charge-offs in the current quarter were $21.0 million, or an annualized 0.70% of related loans, and included 15 basis points due to the one-time $4.7 million cumulative adjustment. This compared with $17.4 million or an annualized 0.73% of average consumer loans in the year-ago quarter. Total consumer net charge-offs in the 2003 fourth quarter were $18.2 million, or an annualized 0.61% of related loans.
     Total automobile loan and lease net charge-offs in the 2004 first quarter were $16.6 million, or an annualized 1.32% of average automobile loans and leases and included 37 basis points from the one-time adjustment. This compared with $11.5 million, or an annualized 1.13% of average automobile loans and leases in the year-ago quarter, and $13.3 million, or an annualized 1.00% in the 2003 fourth quarter.
     Credit losses on operating lease assets are included in operating lease expense and were $6.8 million in the current quarter, down from $12.3 million in the year-ago quarter, and $8.8 million in the 2003 fourth quarter. Recoveries on operating lease assets are included in operating lease income and totaled $1.8 million, $2.3 million, and $1.9 million for the same periods, respectively. The ratio of operating lease asset credit losses, net of recoveries, was an annualized 1.71% in the current quarter, 1.93% in the year-ago quarter, and 2.05% in the 2003 fourth quarter. As noted in the non-interest income discussion above, the operating lease portfolio will decrease over time as no new operating lease assets have been generated since April 2002. As a result, while the absolute level of operating lease credit losses is expected to decline over time, the ratio of credit losses expressed as a percent of declining average operating lease assets is generally expected to gradually increase.
     Non-performing assets (NPAs) were $91.7 million at March 31, 2004. This decreased $49.0 million from a year-ago, but increased $4.3 million from the end of last year. While NPAs increased from year end, the inflow of new NPAs during the quarter totaled $27.2 million, down 29% from the fourth quarter. NPAs expressed as a percent of total loans and leases and other real estate was 0.43% at March 31, 2004, down from 0.74% a year ago, but up slightly from 0.41% at December 31, 2003.
     The over 90-day delinquency, but still accruing, ratio was 0.28% at March 31, 2004. This ratio has been relatively steady over the last five quarters as exemplified by a ratio of 0.30% a
 
year ago and 0.27% at the end of last year.
     The 30-day delinquency ratio decreased to 1.11% at March 31, 2004, from 1.34% at the end of the year-ago first quarter and from 1.23% at December 31, 2003. The total C&I and CRE 30-day delinquency ratio was 0.69% at quarter end, down from 0.85% a year earlier, but up from 0.62% at December 31, 2003. Total consumer 30-day delinquencies were 1.48% at quarter end, down from 1.85% a year ago and from 1.72% at the end of last year.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) and the Reclassification of the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments (AULC)
     The allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) has historically included an allowance for unfunded loan commitments (AULC) component, which we believe to have been common industry practice. To reflect the nature of this reserve and consistent with better disclosure, in the first quarter the AULC was reclassified as a separate liability on the balance sheet. Prior period balance sheet amounts have also been reclassified to be consistent with the current quarter's presentation. This reclassification had no impact on net income, shareholders' equity, or the amount of total reserves aligned with credit risks. When the AULC of $32.1 million at March 31, 2004 is excluded, which is the way these reserve ratios will be calculated and reported going forward, the ALLL reserve and NPA coverage ratios are 1.39% and 322%, respectively. In contrast, the ALLL plus the AULC as a percent of total loans and leases was 1.55% at March 31, 2004, compared with 1.59% at the end of last year. Similarly, the ALLL plus the AULC as a percent of NPAs was 357% at March 31, 2004, compared with 384% at December 31, 2003.
     The March 31, 2004, ALLL was $295.4 million, down from $303.6 million a year ago and $299.7 million at December 31, 2003. These declines primarily reflected improving credit quality and the changed mix of the loan portfolio. Expressed as a percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL at March 31, 2004, was 1.39%, down from 1.61% a year-ago and from 1.42% at December 31, 2003. The ALLL as a percent of NPAs was 322% at March 31, 2004, up significantly from 216% a year ago, but down from 343% at December 31, 2003.
     The provision for loan and lease losses in the 2004 first quarter was $25.6 million, down $11.2 million, or 31%, from the year-ago quarter reflecting improved credit quality, and down $0.7 million, or 3%, from the 2003 fourth quarter.
Capital
     At March 31, 2004, the tangible equity to assets ratio was 6.95%, down slightly from 7.00% a year ago, but up from 6.79% at December 31, 2003. The decline from the year-ago period reflected the impact of the 2003 third quarter adoption of FIN 46, which resulted in the consolidation of $1.0 billion of securitized automobile loans, partially offset by earnings-related growth in capital. At March 31, 2004, the tangible equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was 7.61%, up significantly from 7.09% in the year-ago quarter, and from 7.30% at the end of last year. These increases primarily reflected the positive impact resulting from lowering the overall risk profile of assets, most notably a less risky loan portfolio mix, as well as growth in low risk investment securities.
 
2004 Outlook
     "When we provide earnings guidance it is done on a GAAP basis," Hoaglin said, "including the $1.62-$1.66 earnings per share guidance we provided in January. At that time, we noted this guidance excluded any impact from potential future loan sales or other one-time items. We are updating our 2004 earnings per share guidance to $1.71-$1.75 per share to reflect first quarter GAAP results, as well as an improved credit quality outlook over the remaining three quarters of 2004."
     "We remain committed to the automobile financing business, as well as managing this exposure to our 20% target," he said, "As such, we anticipate continued loan sales. However, since we do not know the timing, or what gains, if any, will be associated with such sales, their impact continues to be excluded from our guidance. Today's updated guidance also does not include any impact from the Unizan merger, which we anticipate closing in early July."

Forward-looking Statement
     This press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, and projections, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. A number of factors, including but not limited to those set forth under the heading "Business Risks" included in Item 1 of Huntington's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and other factors described from time to time in Huntington's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this news release are based on information available at the time of the release. Huntington assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     This earnings release contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the Quarterly Financial Review supplement to this earnings release, which can be found on Huntington's website at .

Annualized data
     Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are "annualized" in this presentation to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical purposes to better discern for decision-making purposes underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
     Income from tax-exempt earnings assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-
 
exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
     Significant one-time income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Management does this for performance analysis and decision-making. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of significant one-time items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is separately disclosed, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
NM or nm
     Percent changes of 100% or more are shown as "nm" or "not meaningful". Such large percent changes typically reflect the impact of one-time items within the measured periods. Since the primary purpose of showing a percent change is for discerning underlying performance trends, such large percent changes are "not meaningful" for this purpose.
