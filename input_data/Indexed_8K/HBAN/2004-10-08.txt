Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On September 4, 2001, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated ("Huntington") granted options for shares of Huntington common stock under the Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") to, with certain specified exceptions, full- and part-time employees actively employed at Huntington as of September 4, 2001. The options have an exercise price of $17.99 per share, which was the closing price of Huntington common stock on September 4, 2001. As of September 30, 2004, options for approximately 2.0 million shares remained outstanding. The shares underlying these options were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 13, 2001 (Registration No. 333-75032).
     Under the terms of the Incentive Plan, these options were to vest on the earlier of September 4, 2006, or at such time as the closing price for Huntington's common stock for five consecutive trading days reached or exceeded $25.00. Huntington's common stock closing price has exceeded $25.00 for each of the five consecutive trading days beginning October 1, 2004, thus, the outstanding options under the Incentive Plan became fully vested and exercisable after the close of trading on October 7, 2004.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
