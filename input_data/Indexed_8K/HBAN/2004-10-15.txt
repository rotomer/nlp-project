EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 15, 2004
     COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; www.huntington.com) reported 2004 third quarter earnings of $93.5 million, or $0.40 per common share, up 3% from both $90.9 million and $0.39 per common share in the year-ago quarter. Compared with 2004 second quarter net income of $110.1 million and $0.47 per common share, 2004 third quarter earnings and earnings per share were both down 15%.
     Earnings for the first nine months of 2004 were $307.8 million, or $1.32 per common share, up 10% and 9%, respectively, from the comparable year-ago period earnings of $279.1 million and $1.21 per common share.
     "Our third quarter fundamental results were good, with another solid quarter of both loan and core deposit growth," said Thomas E. Hoaglin, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "We were also very pleased with the slight increase in the net interest margin. In addition, our credit quality trends continued to be strong. Third quarter net charge-offs as an annualized percent of average total loans and leases were only 30 basis points, which was below our net charge-off target of 35 to 45 basis points for a stable economic environment, and non-performing assets remained at historically low levels."
     "However, reported third quarter results were below expectations due primarily to items related to the ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formal investigation and the pending Unizan Financial Corp. acquisition. Additional SEC related expenses and accruals adversely impacted our earnings by about $0.02 per share, as we continued negotiations with the SEC regarding a settlement. In addition, we also incurred about $0.01 per share of expenses related to the Unizan integration planning and systems conversion."
 
     "Average total loans and leases increased an annualized 18% from the second quarter, excluding the impact of sold automobile loans," he continued. "Average residential mortgage and home equity loans again led loan growth with annualized growth rates of 70% and 15%, respectively. Small business loan growth was strong, increasing at a 14% annualized rate."
     "Average core deposits increased an annualized 7% in the current quarter, compared with the second quarter. This increase reflected good growth in two key deposit categories: non-interest bearing deposits, up 7% annualized, and interest bearing demand deposits, up 12% annualized," he concluded.
     Significant 2004 third quarter performance highlights included:
     Other highlights compared with 2004 second quarter included:
     Items specifically impacting earnings performance comparisons for the current and prior periods are highlighted in the following table.
 
Significant Items Impacting Earnings Performance Comparisons

(1) Includes significant items with $0.01 EPS impact or greater
(2) Favorable (unfavorable) impact on GAAP earnings
(3) GAAP earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (FIN 46)
Discussion of Performance
     Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $6.9 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of an 8% increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 16 basis point, or an effective 5%, decline in the net interest margin. The fully taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.30% from 3.46% reflecting the impact of lower rates and the strategic repositioning of portfolios to reduce automobile loans and increase the relative proportion of lower-rate, and lower-risk, residential real estate-related loans and investment securities.
     Compared with the 2004 second quarter, fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $4.4 million, or 2%, reflecting the favorable impact of a 1% increase in average earning assets and a one basis point increase in the net interest margin to 3.30% from 3.29%.
     Average total loans and leases increased $1.7 billion, or 8%, from the 2003 third quarter due primarily to a $1.3 billion, or 11%, increase in average consumer loans. Contributing to the consumer loan growth was a $1.8 billion, or 84%, increase in average residential mortgages and a $0.5 billion, or 15%, increase in average home equity loans. Demand for residential mortgages and home equity loans remained strong as interest rates declined slightly during the quarter and remained near historically low levels. Average total automobile loans and leases decreased $1.1 billion, or 21%. This decline from the year-ago quarter reflected the sale of $2.6 billion of automobile loans over this 12-month period, partially offset by the rapid growth in direct financing leases due to the migration from operating lease assets, which have not been originated since April 2002.
 
     During the third quarter, $153 million of automobile loans were sold, including $102 million of automobile loans transferred to loans held for sale during the 2004 second quarter. Combined, these transactions resulted in third quarter net pre-tax gains on the sale of automobile loans of $0.3 million. On a combined basis, these transactions increased the total automobile loans sold since the beginning of 2003 to $3.7 billion. These sales represented a continuation of a strategy to reduce exposure to automobile financing to approximately 20% of total credit exposure (see table below). At September 30, 2004, this exposure was $4.9 billion, down from $6.2 billion at year end and represented 21% of total credit exposure, down from 28% at year end 2003, and 33% at the end of 2002.
     Average total commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loan balances were $9.8 billion, up $0.4 billion, or 5%, from the year-ago quarter. This $9.8 billion consisted of middle-market C&I ($4.3 billion, down from $4.5 billion), middle market CRE ($3.5 billion, up from $3.1 billion), and small business C&I and CRE ($1.9 billion) loans. Small business C&I and CRE loans increased $188 million, or 11%. Middle-market C&I and CRE balances were impacted by a June 30, 2004 reclassification of $282 million of C&I loans to CRE loans. Adjusting for this reclassification, average middle-market C&I loans increased $93 million, or 2%, from the year-ago quarter and middle-market CRE loans increased $143 million, or 4%.
     Compared with the second quarter, average total loans and leases increased $0.4 billion, or 2%, with the growth rate mitigated by a $0.5 billion, or 21%, decline in average automobile loans due to the second quarter ($512 million) and third quarter ($153 million) sales of automobile loans. Growth in mortgage-related consumer loans remained strong with average residential mortgages up $0.6 billion, or 17%, and average home equity loans up $0.1 billion, or 4%. Total average C&I and CRE loans increased slightly, primarily reflecting a $63 million, or 3%, increase in small business C&I and CRE loans. As discussed above, middle-market C&I and CRE loan balances were impacted by the $282 million loan reclassification on June 30, 2004. Adjusting for this reclassification, third quarter average middle-market C&I and CRE loans were essentially flat.
     Average investment securities increased $0.7 billion, or 18%, from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected the use of some of the proceeds from the previous sales of automobile loans to purchase 10-year variable rate securities. Compared with the second quarter, average investment securities declined $0.5 billion, or 10%.
 
     Average total core deposits in the third quarter were $16.5 billion, up $0.7 billion, or 4%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting a $0.8 billion, or 13%, increase in average interest bearing demand deposit accounts, partially offset by a $0.1 billion, or 6%, decline in retail CDs. Compared with the 2004 second quarter, average total core deposits increased $0.3 billion, or 2%, reflecting growth in interest bearing demand deposits, up $0.2 billion, or 3%, as well as non-interest bearing deposits, up $0.1 billion, or 2%.
     Non-interest income decreased $82.9 million, or 30%, from the year-ago quarter. Comparisons with prior-period results are heavily influenced by the decline in operating leases and related operating lease income. These trends are expected to continue as all automobile leases originated since April 2002 are direct financing leases with income reflected in net interest income, not non-interest income. Reflecting the run-off of the operating lease portfolio, operating lease income declined $53.2 million, or 45%, from the 2003 third quarter. Excluding operating lease income, non-interest income decreased $29.7 million, or 19%, from the year-ago quarter with the primary drivers being:
Partially offset by:
     Compared with the 2004 second quarter, non-interest income declined $28.2 million, or 13%. This comparison is also heavily influenced by the decline in operating lease income for the
 
reasons noted above. Reflecting the run-off of the operating lease portfolio, operating lease income declined $14.3 million, or 18%, from the 2004 second quarter. Excluding operating lease income, non-interest income decreased $13.9 million, or 10%, from the 2004 second quarter with the primary drivers being:
Partially offset by:
     Non-interest expense decreased $26.8 million, or 9%, from the year-ago quarter. Comparisons with prior-period results are influenced by the decline in operating lease expense as the operating lease portfolio continues to run-off (see above operating lease income discussion). Operating lease expense declined $38.2 million, or 41%, from the 2003 third quarter. The decline in operating lease expense was partially offset by $2.6 million of additional depreciation expense related to automobile leases booked prior to October 1, 2001. Residual value losses on automobile leases booked prior to October 1, 2001, were covered by an insurance policy with a $120 million cap. During the third quarter, residual value losses exceeded this cap a few months earlier than anticipated due to higher than anticipated volume of turned in automobiles and to a lesser degree, softness in the used car market. Total losses above the cap are expected to be $18-$30 million, including $10 million already recognized and reflected in additional accumulated depreciation. Excluding operating lease expense, non-interest expense increased $11.5 million, or 6%, from the year-ago quarter with the primary drivers being:
 
Partially offset by:
     The current quarter included $1.8 million of current quarter expenses related to Unizan integration planning and systems conversion. These expenses were spread across various non-interest expense categories with no meaningful impact on any single line item.
     Compared with the 2004 second quarter, non-interest expense declined $8.7 million, or 3%. Comparisons with prior-period results are also heavily influenced by the decline in operating lease expense. Operating lease expense declined $7.7 million, or 12%, from the 2004 second quarter. Excluding operating lease expense, non-interest expense decreased $1.1 million from the second quarter with the primary drivers being:
Partially offset by:
Credit Quality
     Total net charge-offs for the 2004 third quarter were $16.5 million, or an annualized 0.30% of average total loans and leases. This was a reduction from $32.8 million, or 0.64%, in the year-ago quarter. However, it was an increase from $12.5 million in the second quarter, or an annualized 0.23% of average total loans and leases, as net charge-offs in the second quarter were reduced by a $9.7 million one-time recovery of a previously charged-off commercial loan. This recovery lowered total commercial (C&I and CRE) net charge-offs by 39 basis points and total loan and lease net charge-offs by 18 basis points. Excluding the impact of this recovery, 2004 second quarter total net charge-offs would have been $22.2 million, or an annualized 0.41% of average total loans and leases. Gross charge-offs in the third quarter declined $4.5 million, or 15%, from the second quarter.
     Total commercial net charge-offs in the third quarter were $2.6 million, or an annualized 0.10%, down from $15.8 million, or an annualized 0.68%, in the year-ago quarter and up from only $137 thousand in the previous quarter. Adjusting for the $9.7 million recovery noted above (39 basis point impact), second quarter total commercial net charge-offs would have been $9.8 million, or an annualized 0.40% of related loans.
 
     Total consumer net charge-offs in the current quarter were $13.9 million, or an annualized 0.45% of related loans. This compared with $16.9 million, or 0.61%, in the year-ago quarter and $12.4 million, or an annualized 0.41% of related loans in the 2004 second quarter.
     Total automobile loan and lease net charge-offs in the 2004 third quarter were $7.6 million, or an annualized 0.74% of average automobile loans and leases. This compared with $12.2 million of net charge-offs, or an annualized 0.94%, in the year-ago quarter and $7.8 million, or an annualized 0.69% in the second quarter.
     Credit losses on operating lease assets are included in operating lease expense and were $5.0 million in the current quarter, down from $10.0 million in the year-ago quarter and $5.2 million in the second quarter. Recoveries on operating lease assets are included in operating lease income and totaled $1.2 million, $2.6 million, and $1.5 million, for the same periods, respectively. The ratio of operating lease asset credit losses to average operating lease assets, net of recoveries, was an annualized 1.89% in the current quarter, 1.90% in the year-ago quarter, and 1.51% in the 2004 second quarter. As noted in the non-interest income discussion above, the operating lease portfolio will decline over time as no new operating lease assets have been generated since April 2002.
     Non-performing assets (NPAs) were $80.5 million at September 30, 2004, down $56.6 million, or 41% from the prior year, and up $5.8 million, or 8%, from June 30, 2004. NPAs as a percent of total loans and leases and other real estate were 0.36% at September 30, 2004, down from 0.65% a year-ago, but up slightly from 0.34% at June 30, 2004. At September 30, 2004, the company adopted a new policy of placing home equity loans and lines on non-accrual status when they exceed 180 days past due. Such loans were previously classified as accruing loans and leases past due 90 days or more. This policy change conforms the home equity loans and lines classification to that of other consumer loans secured by residential real estate. As a result of this change in policy, the current quarter included $7.7 million of non-performing home equity loans and lines secured by real estate. NPAs at September 30, 2004, included $30.2 million of lower-risk residential real estate-related assets, which represented 38% of total NPAs. This compared with $19.1 million, or 14%, at the end of the year-ago quarter.
     The over 90-day delinquent, but still accruing, ratio was 0.24% at September 30, 2004, down from 0.31% a year ago, and unchanged from 0.24% at June 30, 2004.
Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)
     The company maintains two reserves, both of which are available to absorb possible credit losses: the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments (AULC). When summed together, these reserves constitute the total allowances for credit losses (ACL).
     The September 30, 2004, ALLL was $282.7 million, down from $336.4 million a year ago and from $286.9 million at June 30, 2004. These declines reflected continued credit quality improvement, the change in the mix of the loan portfolio to lower-risk residential mortgages and home equity loans, and improvement in the economic outlook. Expressed as a percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL at September 30, 2004, was 1.25%, down from 1.59% a year-ago and from 1.32% at June 30, 2004. The ALLL as a percent of NPAs was 351% at September 30, 2004, up from 245% a year ago, but down from 384% at June 30, 2004.
 
     The September 30, 2004, AULC was $30.0 million, down slightly from $33.7 million at the end of the year-ago quarter, and from $31.2 million at June 30, 2004.
     On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases was 1.38% at September 30, 2004, compared with 1.75% a year ago and 1.46% at the end of last quarter. Similarly, the ACL as a percent of NPAs was 389% at September 30, 2004, compared with 270% a year earlier and 426% at June 30, 2004.
     The provision for loan and lease losses in the 2004 third quarter was $11.8 million, a $39.8 million reduction from the year-ago quarter, but a $6.8 million increase from the 2004 second quarter. The reduction in provision expense from the year-ago quarter reflected overall improved portfolio quality performance and a stronger economic outlook, only partially offset by provision expense related to loan growth. The increase in provision expense from the second quarter primarily reflected lower recoveries, as the second quarter included a $9.7 million commercial loan recovery. As previously disclosed, effective January 1, 2004, the company adopted a more quantitative approach to calculating the economic reserve component of the ALLL making this component more responsive to changes in economic conditions. This change, combined with the quantitative approach for determining the transaction reserve component, as well as changes to the specific reserve component, may result in more volatility in the total ALLL, and corresponding provision for loan and lease losses.
Capital
     At September 30, 2004, the tangible equity to assets ratio was 7.11%, up from 6.77% a year ago, and from 6.95% at June 30, 2004. At September 30, 2004, the tangible equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was 7.80%, up significantly from 7.24% in the year-ago quarter, and up from 7.64% at June 30, 2004. The increase in the tangible equity to risk-weighted assets ratio reflected primarily the positive impact resulting from reducing the overall risk profile of earning assets throughout this period, most notably a less risky loan portfolio mix, as well as growth in low risk investment securities.
2004 Outlook
     When earnings guidance is given, it is the company's practice to do so on a GAAP basis. Furthermore, such guidance excludes any impact from potential future loan sales or other one-time items, not certain at the time such earnings guidance is provided. On July 16, 2004, concurrent with the release of 2004 second quarter earnings, the company provided revised 2004 GAAP earnings per share guidance of $1.77-$1.81.
     Reflecting year-to-date actual GAAP earnings per share of $1.32, updated 2004 GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $1.75-$1.77 per share. This excludes the impact from gains or losses associated with loan sales or securitizations, if any, as well as any 2004 fourth quarter impact on earnings from the pending Unizan merger and SEC-related expenses.
Unizan Merger and SEC Formal Investigation
     As reported on June 16, 2004, the Federal Reserve Board informed Huntington that it had extended its review period of the Unizan acquisition. On August 9, 2004, Huntington announced that the company was in negotiations with the staff of the SEC regarding a settlement of the
 
ongoing formal investigation, and Huntington remains in active dialogue with its bank regulators concerning these matters. Huntington and Unizan are ready to close the merger, subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals; however, no assurances can be provided as to the ultimate timing or outcome of these matters.

Forward-looking Statement
     This press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, and projections, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. A number of factors, including but not limited to those set forth under the heading "Business Risks" included in Item 1 of Huntington's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and other factors described from time to time in Huntington's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this news release are based on information available at the time of the release. Huntington assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     This earnings release contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the Quarterly Financial Review supplement to this earnings release, which can be found on Huntington's website at huntington-ir.com.
Annualized data
     Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are "annualized" in this presentation to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
     Income from tax-exempt earnings assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
     Significant one-time income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of significant one-time items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is separately disclosed, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
 
NM or nm
     Percent changes of 100% or more are shown as "nm" or "not meaningful". Such large percent changes typically reflect the impact of one-time items within the measured periods. Since the primary purpose of showing a percent change is for discerning underlying performance trends, such large percent changes are "not meaningful" for this purpose.
