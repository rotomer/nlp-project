Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On February 14, 2005, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and James W. Nelson, Chief Risk Officer and Executive Vice President, entered into an Executive Agreement which provides certain protections for Mr. Nelson, and thus encourages his continued employment, in the event of any actual or threatened change in control of Huntington. The Executive Agreement is retroactively effective to Mr. Nelson's first day of employment, November 9, 2004. Mr. Nelson's Executive Agreement is substantially similar to Huntington's Tier IIA Executive Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
In addition, on February 14, 2005, Mr. Nelson agreed to the terms of a letter agreement setting forth Huntington's agreement to make payment to Mr. Nelson in the event Mr. Nelson's employment is terminated by Huntington, or if Huntington and Mr. Nelson mutually agree to end his employment, in either case without cause, on or prior to November 8, 2006 (the "Letter Agreement"). The Letter Agreement provides that in such event, Mr. Nelson will receive a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (1) two times Mr. Nelson's base salary at the time of termination, plus (2) two times Mr. Nelson's target payment under the Management Incentive Plan at the time of termination, minus all applicable withholdings and deductions. A copy of the Letter Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

The Corporation considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management to be part of its overall corporate strategy and to be essential to protecting and enhancing the interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. As part of this corporate strategy, the Corporation wishes to act to retain its well-qualified executive officers notwithstanding any actual or threatened change in control of the Corporation.
 
The Executive is a key executive officer of the Corporation and the Executive's services, experience and knowledge of the affairs of the Corporation, and reputation and contacts in the industry are extremely valuable to the Corporation. The Executive's continued dedication, availability, advice, and counsel to the Corporation are deemed important to the Corporation, its Board of Directors (the "Board"), and its shareholders. It is, therefore, in the best interests of the Corporation to secure the continued services of the Executive notwithstanding any actual or threatened change in control of the Corporation. Accordingly, the Board has approved this Agreement with the Executive and authorized its execution and delivery on behalf of the Corporation.
 
 
The Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and will continue in effect through December 31, . On December 31, , and on the second anniversary date of each term thereafter (a "Renewal Date"), the term of this Agreement will be extended automatically for an additional two-year period unless, not later than 30 days prior to such Renewal Date, the Corporation gives written notice to the Executive that it has elected not to extend this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if a "Change of Control" (as defined herein) of the Corporation occurs during the term of this Agreement, the term of this Agreement will be extended for 36 months beyond the end of the month in which any such Change of Control occurs.

(3) After being notified in writing by the Board to cease any particular Competitive Activity (as defined herein), the Executive shall have continued such Competitive Activity and the Board shall have determined that such act is materially harmful to the Corporation.
 
For purposes of this Agreement, no act or failure to act on the part of the Executive shall be deemed "intentional" if it was due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence, but shall be deemed "intentional" only if done or omitted to be done by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interest of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for "Cause" under this Agreement unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the Board at a meeting called and held for such purposes, after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with the Executive's counsel (if the Executive chooses to have counsel present at such meeting), to be heard before the Board, finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive had committed an act constituting "Cause" as defined in this Agreement and specifying the particulars of the act constituting "Cause" in detail.

Upon the expiration of the health care benefits required to be provided pursuant to this subsection 4(d), the Executive shall be entitled to the continuation of such benefits under the provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.

In the event the Executive's participation in any such plan or program is not permitted, the Corporation will directly provide, at no after-tax cost to the Executive, the benefits to which the Executive would be entitled under such plans and programs.
 
(e) The Executive will be entitled to receive retirement benefits as provided herein, so that the total retirement benefits the Executive receives from the Corporation will approximate the total retirement benefits the Executive would have received under all (qualified and nonqualified) retirement plans (which shall not include severance plans) of the Corporation in which the Executive participates were the Executive fully vested under such retirement plans and had the Executive continued in the employ of the Corporation for 24 months following the date of the Executive's termination or until the Executive's Retirement, if earlier (provided that such additional period shall be inclusive of and shall not be in addition to any period of service credited under any severance plan of the Corporation). The benefits specified in this subsection will include all ancillary benefits, such as early retirement and survivor rights and benefits available at retirement. The amount payable to the Executive or the Executive's beneficiaries under this subsection shall equal the excess of (1) the retirement benefits that would be paid to the Executive or the Executive's beneficiaries, under all retirement plans of the Corporation in which the Executive participates if (A) the Executive were fully vested under such plans, (B) the 24-month period (or the period until the Executive's Retirement, if less) following the date of the Executive's termination were added to the Executive's credited service under such plans, (C) the terms of such plans were those most favorable to the Executive in effect at any time during the period commencing prior to the Change of Control and ending on the date of Notice of Termination (or on the date employment is terminated if no Notice of Termination is required), and (D) the Executive's highest average annual compensation as defined under such retirement plans and was calculated as if the Executive had been employed by the Corporation for a 24-month period (or the period until the Executive's Retirement, if earlier) following the date of the Executive's termination and had the Executive's compensation during such period been equal to the Executive's compensation used to calculate the Executive's benefit under subsections 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c); over (2) the retirement benefits that are payable to the Executive or the Executive's beneficiaries under all retirement plans of the Corporation in which the Executive participates. These retirement benefits specified in this subsection are to be provided on an unfunded basis, are not intended to meet the qualification requirements of Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code, and shall be payable solely from the general assets of the Corporation. These retirement benefits shall be payable at the time and in the manner provided in the applicable retirement plans to which they relate.
Retirement Benefits.
 
Tier IIA
 
(f) The Corporation shall pay all fees for outplacement services for the Executive up to a maximum equal to 15% of the Executive's Annual Base Salary used to calculate the Executive's benefit under subsection 4(a), plus provide a travel expense account of up to $5,000 to reimburse job search travel.

(g) . Stock Options held by the Executive become exercisable upon a Change of Control according to the terms of the Corporation's Stock Option Plans as interpreted by the Corporation's Compensation Committee as such Committee existed immediately prior to the Change of Control.
Stock Options
 
In computing and determining Severance Benefits under subsections 4(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) above, a decrease in the Executive's salary, incentive bonus potential, or insurance benefits shall be disregarded if such decrease occurs within six months before a Change of Control, is in contemplation of such Change of Control, and is taken to avoid the effect of this Agreement should such action be taken after such Change of Control. In such event, the salary, incentive bonus potential, and/or insurance benefits used to determine Severance Benefits shall be that in effect immediately before the decrease that is disregarded pursuant to this Section 4.
 
The Severance Benefits provided in subsections 4(a), (b), and (c) above shall be paid not later than 45 business days following the date the Executive's employment terminates.
 
If any Severance Benefit or other benefit paid or provided under Section 4, or the acceleration of stock option vesting, or the payment or distribution of any Employee Benefit or similar benefit is subject to excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (or any similar federal or state excise tax), the Corporation shall pay to the Executive such additional compensation as is necessary (after taking into account all federal, state, and local income taxes payable by the Executive as a result of the receipt of such additional compensation) to place the Executive in the same after-tax position he would have been in had no such excise tax (or any interest or penalties thereon) been paid or incurred with respect to any of such amounts (the "Tax Gross-Up"). The Corporation shall pay such additional compensation at the time when the Corporation withholds such excise tax from any payments to the Executive. The calculation of the Tax Gross-Up shall be approved by the Corporation's independent certified public accounting firm engaged by the Corporation immediately prior to the Change in Control and the calculation shall be provided to the Executive in writing. The Executive shall then be given 15 days, or such longer period as the Executive reasonably requests, to accept or reject the calculation of the Tax Gross-Up. If the Executive rejects the Tax Gross-Up calculation and the parties are thereafter unable to agree within an additional 45 days, the arbitration provisions of Section 10 shall control. The Corporation shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable legal and accounting fees incurred with respect to the calculation of the Tax Gross-Up and any disputes related thereto.
5. Tax Gross-Up.
 
Tier IIA
 
For purposes of determining the amount of the Tax Gross-Up, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Tax Gross-Up is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence on the date of termination.
 
If the excise tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of termination of employment, the Executive shall repay to the Corporation at the time the reduction in excise tax is finally determined, the portion of the Tax Gross-Up attributable to such reduction. Notwithstanding the Executive's acceptance or rejection of the Tax Gross-Up calculation, if the excise tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of termination of employment, the Corporation shall make an additional Tax Gross-Up payment to the Executive in respect of such excess at the time the amount of such excess is finally determined.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5, if any Severance Benefit or other benefit paid or provided under Section 4, or the acceleration of stock option vesting, or the payment or distribution of any Employee Benefits or similar benefits would be subject to excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code (or any similar federal or state excise tax), but would not be so subject if the total of such payments would be reduced by 10% or less, then such payment shall be reduced by the minimum amount necessary so as not to cause Corporation to have paid an Excess Severance Payment as defined in Section 280G(b)(l) of the Code and so the Executive will not be subject to Excise Tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. The calculation of any potential reduction pursuant to this paragraph or any disputes related thereto shall be resolved as described above with respect to the calculation of the Tax Gross-Up. In the event that the amount of any Severance Payments that would be payable to or for the benefit of Executive under this Agreement must be modified or reduced to comply with this provision, Executive shall direct which Severance Payments are to be modified or reduced; provided, however, that no increase in the amount of any payment or change in the timing of the payment shall be made without the consent of Corporation. In no event shall the total payments be reduced by more than 10% in order to avoid treatment as an Excess Severance Payment.
 
The Corporation may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city, or other taxes as required by law.
6. Withholding of Taxes.
 
The Corporation hereby acknowledges that it will be difficult and may be impossible for the Executive to find reasonably comparable employment, or to measure the amount of damages which the Executive may suffer as a result of termination of employment hereunder. Accordingly, the payment of the Severance Benefits by the Corporation to the Executive in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is hereby acknowledged by the Corporation to be reasonable and will be liquidated damages, and the Executive will not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor will any profits, income, earnings, or other benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset, reduction, or any other obligation on the part of the Executive hereunder or otherwise, except for a reduction in health

insurance coverage as provided in subsection 4(d)(1). The Corporation shall not be entitled to set off or counterclaim against amounts payable hereunder with respect to any claim, debt, or obligation of the Executive.
 
The Corporation is aware that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Board or a stockholder of the Corporation may then cause or attempt to cause the Corporation to refuse to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, or may cause or attempt to cause the Corporation to institute, or may institute, litigation, arbitration, or other legal action seeking to have this Agreement declared unenforceable, or may take, or attempt to take, other action to deny the Executive the benefits intended under this Agreement. In these circumstances, the purpose of this Agreement could be frustrated. It is the intent of the Corporation that the Executive not be required to incur the expenses associated with the enforcement of the Executive's rights under this Agreement by litigation, arbitration, or other legal action nor be bound to negotiate any settlement of the Executive's rights hereunder under threat of incurring such expenses because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Executive under this Agreement. Accordingly, if following a Change in Control it should appear to the Executive that the Corporation has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement, including the proper calculation of the Tax Gross-Up, or in the event that the Corporation or any other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institute any litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish, or to recover from the Executive, the benefits intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, the Corporation irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain counsel (legal and accounting) of the Executive's choice at the expense of the Corporation as provided in this Section 8 to represent the Executive in connection with the calculation of the Tax Gross-Up, or the initiation or defense of any litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Corporation or any director, officer, stockholder, or other person affiliated with the Corporation. Notwithstanding any existing or prior attorney-client relationship between the Corporation and such counsel, the Corporation irrevocably consents to the Executive entering into an attorney-client relationship with such counsel, and in that connection the Corporation and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship shall exist between the Executive and such counsel. The reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected from time to time by the Executive as provided in this Section shall be paid or reimbursed to the Executive by the Corporation on a regular, periodic basis upon presentation by the Executive of a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in accordance with its customary practices. In any action involving this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to prejudgment interest on any amounts found to be due him from the date such amounts would have been payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement at an annual rate of interest equal to the prime commercial rate in effect at The Huntington National Bank or its successor from time to time during the prejudgment period plus 4 percent.
8. Enforcement Costs; Interest.
 
From and after the earliest to occur of a Change of Control or termination of employment, the Corporation shall (a) for a period of five years after such occurrence, provide the Executive (including the Executive's heirs, executors, and administrators) with coverage under a standard directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
9. Indemnification.
 
Tier IIA
 
at the Corporation's expense, and (b) indemnify and hold harmless the Executive, to the fullest extent permitted or authorized by the law of the State of Maryland as it may from time to time be amended, if the Executive is (whether before or after the Change of Control) made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that the Executive is or was a director, officer, or employee of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or any Subsidiary as a director, trustee, officer, or employee of a bank, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. The indemnification provided by this Section 9 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Executive may be entitled under the charter or bylaws of the Corporation or of any Subsidiary, or any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in the Executive's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to the Executive after the Executive has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the Executive.
 
The initial method for resolving any dispute arising out of this Agreement shall be nonbinding arbitration in accordance with this Section. Except as provided otherwise in this Section, arbitration pursuant to this Section shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. A party wishing to obtain arbitration of an issue shall deliver written notice to the other party, including a description of the issue to be arbitrated. Within 15 days after either party demands arbitration, the Corporation and the Executive shall each appoint an arbitrator. Within 15 additional days, these two arbitrators shall appoint the third arbitrator by mutual agreement; if they fail to agree within this 15 day period, then the third arbitrator shall be selected promptly pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association for Commercial Arbitration. The arbitration panel shall hold a hearing in Columbus, Ohio, within 90 days after the appointment of the third arbitrator. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator, and any American Arbitration Association fees, shall be paid by the Corporation. Both the Corporation and the Executive may be represented by counsel (legal and accounting) and may present testimony and other evidence at the hearing. Within 90 days after commencement of the hearing, the arbitration panel will issue a written decision; the majority vote of two of the three arbitrators shall control. The majority decision of the arbitrators shall not be binding on the parties, and the parties may pursue other available legal remedies if the parties are not satisfied with the majority decision of the arbitrator. The Executive shall be entitled to seek specific performances of the Executive's rights under this Agreement during the pendency of any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement.
10. Arbitration.
 
This Agreement sets forth the Severance Benefits payable to the Executive in the event the Executive's employment with the Corporation is terminated under certain conditions specified in Section 3. This Agreement is not an employment contract nor shall it confer upon the Executive any right to continue in the employ of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries and shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries to dismiss or otherwise terminate the Executive's employment at any time with or without cause.
11. Employment Rights.
 
Tier IIA
 
The specific benefit arrangements referred to in this Agreement are not intended to exclude the Executive from participation in or from other benefits available to executive personnel generally or to preclude the Executive's right to other compensation or benefits as may be authorized by the Board at any time. The provisions of this Agreement and any payments provided for hereunder shall not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish the Executive's existing rights, or rights which would accrue solely as the result of the passage of time under any compensation plan, benefit plan, incentive plan, stock option plan, employment agreement, or other contract, plan, or arrangement except as may be specified in such contract, plan, or arrangement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12, the Severance Benefits provided in Section 4 are in lieu of any benefits to which the Executive would be entitled following the termination of his or her employment pursuant to any Employment Agreement or pursuant to the Corporation's Transition Pay Plan or any successor to such plan.
12. Arrangements Not Exclusive.
 
Except for termination of employment described in Section 3, this Agreement shall terminate if the employment of the Executive with the Corporation shall terminate prior to a Change in Control.
13. Termination.
 
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal and legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. The Executive's rights and benefits under this Agreement may not be assigned, except that if the Executive dies while any amount would still be payable to the Executive hereunder if the Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to the beneficiaries designated by the Executive to receive benefits under this Agreement in a writing on file with the Corporation at the time of the Executive's death or, if there is no such beneficiary, to the Executive's estate. The Corporation will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation (or of any division or Subsidiary thereof employing the Executive) to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Corporation to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Corporation in the same amount and on the same terms to which the Executive would be entitled hereunder if the Executive terminated employment for Good Reason following a Change of Control.
14. Successors; Binding Agreements.
 
Neither the Executive nor the Executive's beneficiaries shall have any right, title, or interest in any benefit under this Agreement prior to the occurrence of the right to the payment of such benefit.
15. No Vested Interest.
 
For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally or mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the such addresses as each party may designate from time to time

If any payments otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement are prohibited or limited by any statute or regulation in effect at the time the payments would otherwise be payable, including, without limitation, any regulation issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the "FDIC") that limits executive change of control payments that can be made by an FDIC insured institution or its holding company if the institution is financially troubled (any such limiting statute or regulation a "Limiting Rule"):

Following any such election, the Executive will be entitled to receive benefits under this agreement or plan elected only if and to the extent the agreement or plan is applicable and subject to its specific terms.
 
This Agreement may not be amended or modified and no provision may be waived unless such amendment, modification, or waiver is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and the Corporation.
18. Amendment; Waiver.
 
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

Re:       
Payment Upon Termination of Employment
 
Dear Jim:
 
This letter confirms Huntington Bancshares Incorporated's (hereinafter "Huntington") offer to compensate you in the event your employment is terminated by Huntington or you and Huntington mutually agree to end your employment, in either case without cause, on or prior to November 8, 2006. As we have discussed, in order to help ensure a smooth transition into new employment, Huntington has agreed to provide you with the following payment under either of these circumstances.
 
Huntington agrees to pay you a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (1) two times your base salary at the time of termination plus (2) two times your target Management Incentive Plan (MIP) payment amount at the time of termination, minus all applicable withholdings and deductions. This amount will be paid to you within thirty (30) days of your last day of employment with Huntington.
 
As previously noted, this payment will be made in the event your employment is terminated by Huntington or you and Huntington mutually agree to end your employment, in either case without cause, on or prior to November 8, 2006. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Cause" is defined to be identical to the definition contained in your Executive Agreement. Please note that if a "Change of Control" (as defined in the Executive Agreement) of the Corporation occurs on or prior to November 8, 2006, your eligibility for benefits under this Agreement will cease, and your right to benefits upon termination of employment will be governed solely by your Executive Agreement. Please also note that nothing in this Agreement alters or changes your at-will employment status with Huntington.

I believe that the above information accurately reflects the agreement we reached regarding this payment. If you agree, please sign below acknowledging your agreement and acceptance of these payment terms.
 
 
I agree that I have read this letter in its entirety, fully understand it, and am in full accord and agreement with the terms contained herein.
