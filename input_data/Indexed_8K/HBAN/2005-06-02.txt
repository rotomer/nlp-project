NEWSRELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 2, 2005
COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; www.huntington.com) announced that the five-member Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") approved the settlement of its previously announced formal investigation into certain financial accounting matters.
As a part of the settlement, the Commission instituted a cease and desist administrative proceeding and entered a cease and desist order, as well as filed a civil action in federal district court pursuant to which, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Huntington, its chief executive officer, Thomas Hoaglin, its former chief financial officer, Michael McMennamin, and its former controller, John Van Fleet have consented to pay civil money penalties. Huntington consented to pay a penalty of $7.5 million, which may be distributed pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This civil money penalty has no current period financial impact on Huntington's results, as reserves for this amount were established and expensed in 2004.
In the administrative proceeding, the Commission charged that in its 2001 and 2002 fiscal years Huntington violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1; that Hoaglin violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 and caused Huntington's violations of Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) and Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 with respect to fiscal year 2002; that McMennamin and Van Fleet violated Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3), Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and caused Huntington's violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 in fiscal years 2001 and 2002; and that McMennamin directly violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 in 2002. Without admitting or denying the charges in the administrative proceeding, Huntington and the individuals each agreed to cease and desist from committing and/or causing the violations charged as well as any future violations of these provisions. Additionally, Hoaglin, McMennamin, and Van Fleet agreed to pay disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, and penalties in the amounts of $667,609, $415,215, and $51,660, respectively. Van Fleet consented to a suspension from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant for two years pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice. McMennamin consented to an undertaking that he will not act as an officer or director of a public company for five years.
Hoaglin stated, "Huntington is pleased that the SEC investigation is now concluded. We are a stronger company as a result of substantive enhancements to our accounting controls, and we continue our focus on growing our businesses and serving our customers."
