Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On June 8, 2006, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated ("HBI"), through a newly established limited partnership (the "Borrower"), borrowed $865 million (the "Loan") pursuant to a credit agreement (the "Agreement) with unaffiliated third parties. The Loan is indirectly backed by a revolving pool of consumer automobile loans and a static pool of consumer automobile leases originated and serviced by subsidiaries of HBI. Payments of principal of and interest on, and other proceeds from, the pool of loans and leases will ultimately be used to repay the principal and pay the interest on the Loan. The Loan was made in a single advance and on a non-recourse basis. The Loan has a stated maturity date of November 20, 2017. Interest will accrue at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 0.492%. Payments of principal and interest are required to be made on the Loan beginning on November 20, 2010. The Loan may be prepaid at any time, and may be accelerated on the occurrence of an event of default un der the Agreement. The events of default are standard for agreements of this type and include, for example, payment and covenant breaches, insolvency of the Borrower or HBI, the occurrence of an event of default relating to the collateral, or a change in control of the Borrower.
