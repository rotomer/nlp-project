Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
At a meeting on July 18, 2006, the Compensation Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated ("Huntington") approved a form of Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice which provides for three-year vesting and a form of Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice which provides for six-month vesting for awards of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") to employees, including executive officers pursuant to the Corporation's 2004 Stock and Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2004 Plan"), previously approved by the shareholders. All RSUs granted under these forms of Notice may be settled in shares of Huntington common stock and accumulated cash dividends. The Committee also approved a form of Restricted Stock Unit Deferral Agreement pursuant to which RSUs granted to senior officers on July 18, 2006 and having a three-year vesting period may be deferred at the election of such officers under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. Copies of the Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice with three-year ve sting, the Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice with six-month vesting, and the Restricted Stock Unit Deferral Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the Committee approved a form of Director Deferred Stock Award Notice for grants of Deferred Stock Awards to the directors pursuant to the 2004 Plan. The Deferred Stock Award Notice provides that the awards are immediately vested in units and payable in shares of common stock and accumulated cash dividends six months after separation from service. The form of Director Deferred Stock Award Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.4 and incorporated herein by reference. The Committee also increased the base salary for Thomas E. Hoaglin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer by 5% to $865,000.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
On July 18, 2006, Huntington's Board of Directors appointed Thomas P. Reed to the position of Controller.

Mr. Reed also serves as a director (since May 2003), Vice President (since May 2004), and Treasurer (since August 2004) for Huntington Preferred Capital, Inc. Donald R. Kimble, who formerly held the positions of both Chief Financial Officer and Controller, will continue as Chief Financial Officer.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 18, 2006, the Committee adopted senior executive share ownership guidelines. These guidelines require that the Chief Executive Officer, other members of the Management Committee, and Regional Presidents, own specific minimum levels of Huntington common stock. How much is to be owned is based on the base salary of the executive as of July 18, 2006 and expressed in terms of a number of shares based on $23.34 per share; i.e., the mean of Huntington's common stock high and low trading price as of July 18, 2006.

Undefined capitalized terms used in this Notice shall have the meanings set forth in the Company's 2004 Stock and Long-Term Incentive Plan as may be amended from time to time (the "Plan").
THIS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT NOTICE
the Company maintains the Plan.
WHEREAS,
pursuant to Article 8 of the Plan, the Committee may grant awards of Restricted Stock Units to employees, and have such grants settled in shares of the Company's common stock, without par value ("Shares").
WHEREAS,
the Company desires to compensate the Employee with a grant of Restricted Stock Units for the Employee's future services to the Company.
WHEREAS,
in consideration of the premises, the Company grants the Employee an Award of Restricted Stock Units under the following terms and conditions:
NOW, THEREFORE,
1. 
Grant of Restricted Stock Units
.
The Company, by authority of the Committee, hereby grants to the Employee an Award of the number of Restricted Stock Units identified above (the "Grant") to be issued in accordance with all of the terms and conditions set forth in this Notice and the Plan. The Restricted Stock Units will be a bookkeeping entry (the "RSU Account"), and each Restricted Stock Unit shall be equivalent to one Share. All terms and conditions set forth in the Plan are deemed to be incorporated herein in their entirety.
2. 
Employee Accounts
.
The number of Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Notice shall be credited to the Employee's RSU Account. Each RSU Account shall be maintained on the books of the Company until full payment of the balance thereof has been made to the Employee (or the Employee's beneficiaries if the Employee is deceased) in accordance with Section 1 above. No funds shall be set aside or earmarked for any RSU Account, which shall be purely a bookkeeping device.
3. 
Vesting and Forfeiture Provisions
.
(a) Except as provided below, if the Employee is continuously employed by the Company through the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (July 18, 2009), all of the Employee's Restricted Stock Units in the Employee's Restricted Stock Unit Account will vest.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if, on or after the date that is six months after the Date of Grant (January 18, 2007) and before the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (July 18, 2009), 1) the Employee's employment or service with the Company terminates due to Retirement or death, or 2) the Company terminates the Employee without Cause (as defined in Section 2.6 of the Plan, including new Section 2.6(d) of the Plan), the Employee shall vest in a prorated number of Shares (with any fractional Shares rounded up to the next whole number) equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units Subject to Grant times a fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall be the number, which in no event shall be greater than 36, of all full and partial months (with partial months being counted as full months) that passed beginning with the month that contains the Date of Grant and ending with the month in which the Employee's termination occurred. The denominator of the fraction shall be 36.
(c) If, before the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (July 18, 2009), 1) the Employee voluntarily terminates employment or service with the Company for a reason other than Retirement, or 2) the Company terminates the Employee for Cause (as defined in Section 2.6 of the Plan, including new Section 2.6(d) of the Plan), the Employee's Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited. If, before the date that is six months after the Date of Grant, the Employee's service with the company terminates for any reason, then the Employee shall forfeit all Restricted Stock Units granted under this Notice.
(d) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Employee shall become immediately vested in 100% of the Restricted Stock Units in the Employee's RSU Account.
(e) The Company will not have any further obligations to the Employee under this Grant if the Employee's Restricted Stock Units are forfeited as provided herein, including the payment of any dividends provided for in Section 9 of this Notice.
4. 
Issuance of Stock
.
The Company, or its transfer agent, will convert the Restricted Stock Units in the Employee's RSU Account into Shares and deliver the total number of Shares due to the Employee within 60 days after the date the Restricted Stock Units vest or as soon as administratively possible after such date, except as otherwise provided in Section 11 below. However, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if, in the reasonable determination of the Company, an Employee is a "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the guidance promulgated thereunder ("Code Section 409A"), then, if necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the Company shall not deliver the Shares otherwise payable upon the Employee's termination and separation of service until the date that is 30 days after 6 months following the Employee's termination and separation of service from the Company. The delivery of the Shares shall be subject to payment of the applicable withholding tax liability as set forth in Section 4. If the Employee dies before the Company has distributed any portion of the vested Restricted Stock Units, the Company will transfer any Shares payable with respect to the vested Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the Employee's written beneficiary designation or to the Employee's estate if no written beneficiary designation is provided. If the Employee did not have a will, any Shares payable with respect to the vested Restricted Stock Units will be distributed in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution.
5. 
Withholding Taxes
.
The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require the Employee to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Notice, including the payment of Shares or cash. With regard to the above, the Company is permitted to withhold a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to Employee's withholding obligations, based on the minimum federal, state and local and other tax withholding rate, and to pay this amount to the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority on the Employee's behalf. Delivery or withholding of fractional Shares is not permitted, and as such, the Company may round any fractional Shares up or down to the next whole Share to satisfy the withholding obligations.
6. 
Non-transferability of Grant
.
The Restricted Stock Units granted herein and the rights and privileges conferred hereby may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated (by operation of law or otherwise), other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.
7. 
Employee's Rights Unsecured
.
The right of the Employee or his or her beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company, and neither the Employee nor his or her beneficiary shall have any rights in or against any amounts credited to the Employee's RSU Account or any other specific assets of the Company. All amounts credited to the Employee's RSU Account shall constitute general assets of the Company and may be disposed of by the Company at such time and for such purposes as it may deem appropriate.
8. 
No Voting Rights as Stockholder
.
Until the Restricted Stock Units have vested and Shares have been issued, Employee shall not have any voting rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units.
9. 
Dividends
.
To the extent that cash dividends are paid on Shares after the Date of Grant and before the date the Employee receives the Shares subject to this Grant, the Employee shall receive credits of cash in a dividend bookkeeping account (the "Dividend Account"). Such cash credits shall be equal in value (based on the reported dividend rate on the date dividends were paid) to the amount of dividends paid on the Shares represented by the Restricted Stock Units in the Employee's RSU Account. The Employee shall vest in the cash in the Dividend Account in accordance with Section 3 of the Notice in the same manner that the Employee vests in the Restricted Stock Units held in the RSU Account, except that if the Employee terminates employment for a reason described in Section 3(b) of the Notice, the Employee will be vested in the dividends accumulated in the Dividend Account from the Date of Grant to the date of termination. On the date that the Employee receives a distribution of Shares from the RSU Account (provided that such date is at least six months after the Date of Grant), the Employee shall also receive a distribution of the cash in the Dividend Account.
10. 
Capital Adjustment Provisions
.
In the event of a stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, reorganization, redesignation, or other change in the Company's capitalization, the number of Restricted Stock Units in the Employee's RSU Account shall be proportionately adjusted or substituted to reflect such change.
11. 
Securities Law Compliance
.
The delivery of all or any of the Shares shall only be effective at such time that the issuance of such Shares will not violate any state or federal securities or other laws. The Company is under no obligation to effect any registration of Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 or to effect any state registration or qualification of the Shares. The Company may, in its sole discretion, delay the delivery of the Shares or place restrictive legends on such Shares in order to ensure that the issuance of any Shares will be in compliance with federal or state securities laws and the rules of the Nasdaq or any other exchange upon which the Company's common stock is traded. If the Company delays the delivery of the Shares in order to ensure compliance with any state or federal securities or other laws, the Company shall deliver the Shares at the earliest date at which the Company reasonably believes that such delivery will not cause such violation, or at such other date that may be permitted under Code Section 409A.
12. 
Plan Governs
.
The Grant is made under the Plan. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Notice and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. A copy of the Plan is available upon request by contacting the Human Resources Department at the Company's executive offices.
13. 
No Right to Continued Employment
.
The Employee understands and agrees that this Notice does not impact in any way the right of the Company to terminate or change the terms of the employment of Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. The Employee understands and agrees that his or her employment with the Company is on an "at-will" basis only.

WHEREAS, on July 18, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Company (the "Committee"), pursuant to the Company's 2004 Stock and Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan"), granted certain Employees Restricted Stock Units ("Restricted Stock Units"), subject to a Grant Notice that included time-based vesting conditions established by the Committee; and
WHEREAS, if the Employee meets the time-based conditions, the Restricted Stock Units would vest on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (July 18, 2009), as defined in the Grant Notice; and
WHEREAS, the Employee desires to defer the receipt of his or her Restricted Stock Units if the Employee satisfies the time-based vesting conditions that were in the Grant Notice; and
WHEREAS, the Committee has adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan for the purpose of permitting deferrals of Restricted Stock (including Restricted Stock Units) that would otherwise be payable to the Employee under the Stock Plan; and
WHEREAS, the Company will amend and restate the Deferred Compensation Plan by December 31, 2006, r such later date as may be permitted under Code Section 409A, to more fully incorporate these Terms and Conditions and to bring the Deferred Compensation Plan into compliance with Code Section 409A for amounts deferred (earned and vested) after December 31, 2004, with such changes as the proper officers of the Company deem appropriate; and
WHEREAS, Code Section 409A allows participants in a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement to defer the receipt of Restricted Stock Units within 30 days of the date of grant of ad hoc awards, including grants of restricted stock units; and
WHEREAS, by a resolution dated July 18, 2006 (the "Committee Resolution"), the Committee has determined that an Employee may defer his or her Restricted Stock Units, the payment of which the Company will make to the Employee in the form of shares of the Company's common stock, without par value ("Shares") if the Employee satisfies the time-based vesting conditions established by the Committee; and
WHEREAS, under the Committee Resolution, the Committee has determined that certain employees may defer the receipt of payment of his or her Restricted Stock Units by entering into this Agreement by executing and delivering to the Company an Election Form (as defined below) to that effect; and
WHEREAS, the Company, according to the Committee Resolution, and the Employee desire to establish the terms upon which the Employee may defer a portion of his or her Restricted Stock Units;
NOW, THEREFORE, in regard to the above, the deferral of the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
1. .
Election to Defer
The Employee may elect to defer the receipt of an amount of Restricted Stock Units (but in no event fewer than 100 Restricted Stock Units) in the Employee's RSU Account and cash dividends in the Employee's Dividend Account payable under the Grant Notice, in any increment of 10%, from a minimum of 50% to a maximum of 90% of the Restricted Stock Units and cash dividends. In no event, however, may the amount deferred exceed the amount of required tax withholding. The Company may adjust the number of Restricted Stock Units and dividends deferred to the extent necessary to bring the deferrals into compliance with the amounts specified in this Section 1 of these Terms and Conditions.
2. .
Deferral Election and Election Form
The Employee may make an election to defer the Restricted Stock Units in the RSU Account, in accordance with Section 1 of these Terms and Conditions, by completing and delivering the Election Form to the Company. In order to be effective, the Election Form must be delivered to the Company within 30 days of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the Grant Notice. If the Employee does not return the Election Form to the Company within 30 days after the Date of Grant in the Grant Notice, the Election Form will not be effective.
3. .
Employee Accounts
(a) The Company will credit the number of Restricted Stock Units that the Employee elected to defer from the Employee's RSU Account to a share unit bookkeeping account (the "Deferred Stock Unit Account") established for the Employee. In making such credits to the Employee's Deferred Stock Unit Account, the Company may, in its discretion, round any fractional Shares up or down to the next whole number. The Company will convert the RSU Account established and maintained under the Grant Notice to the Deferred Stock Unit Account established by these Terms and Conditions by crediting the value of the Deferred Stock Unit Account with the number of Restricted Stock Units in the Employee's RSU Account.
(b) The Company will credit the amount of cash dividends that the Employee elected to defer from the Employee's Dividend Account established and maintained under the Grant Notice to one of the following bookkeeping accounts (the "Accounts"): (1) the Employee's Deferred Stock Unit Account, or (2) an account maintained for employees under the Deferred Compensation Plan that holds all amounts of deferred compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Account"). The Company shall have the sole discretion to determine in which Account to credit such cash dividends.
(c) The Accounts shall be maintained on the books of the Company until full payment of the balance thereof has been made to the applicable Employee (or the beneficiaries of a deceased Employee) as described in Section 6 below. No funds shall be set aside or earmarked for any of the Accounts, each of which shall be purely a bookkeeping device.
4. .
Dividends
To the extent that cash dividends are paid on Shares after the third anniversary of the Date of Grant in the Grant Notice and before the distribution date, such dividends shall accumulate and be reinvested in the Account the Company selected pursuant to Section 3(b) of these Terms and Conditions.
5. .
Capital Adjustment Provisions
In the event of a stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, reorganization, redesignation, or other change in the Company's capitalization, the number of Restricted Stock Units in the Employee's Deferred Stock Unit Account shall be proportionately adjusted or substituted to reflect such change.
6. .
Distribution of Employee Restricted Stock Units
(a) If the Employee previously filed an Initial Distribution Election Form, the Employee shall receive distributions under this Agreement pursuant to the Initial Distribution Election Form that the Employee filed with the Company and the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. If the Employee has not previously filed an Initial Distribution Election Form with the Company, the Employee shall receive distributions under this Agreement pursuant to the Election Form to which these Terms and Conditions are attached and the Deferred Compensation Plan.
(b) Upon termination and separation of the Employee's service to the Company, as defined in Code Section 409A, due to the Employee's retirement under one or more of the Company's retirement plans (a "Retirement Termination"), the Company shall distribute the Employee's Deferred Stock Unit Account to the Employee in the form of Shares (which may be originally issued Shares or Shares purchased on the open market) in one of the following forms of distribution as elected by the Employee and provided under the Deferred Compensation Plan: (1) up to ten substantially equal annual distributions beginning as soon as administratively practical after the date of such Retirement Termination, per the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, or (2) a lump sum as soon as administratively practical after the date of such Retirement Termination, per the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. The form of distributionlump sum or installmentsmust be specified at the time the Election Form is completed if an Initial Distribution Election Form is not already on file. If no form of distribution is elected, the distribution shall be in a lump sum. However, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if the Committee reasonably determines that an Employee also is a "specified employee" for purposes of Code Section 409A, then no distribution shall occur until a date no earlier than 6 months following the date of the Employee's Retirement Termination.
(c) Upon termination and separation of the Employee's service to the Company, as defined in Code Section 409A, for any reason other than retirement under one or more of the Company's retirement plans or for death (a "Non-Retirement Termination"), the Company shall distribute the Employee's Deferred Stock Unit Account to the Employee in the form of Shares (which may be originally issued Shares or Shares purchased on the open market) in one of the following forms of distribution as elected by the Employee and provided under the Deferred Compensation Plan: (1) up to three substantially equal annual distributions beginning as soon as administratively practical after the date of such Non-Retirement Termination, per the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, or (2) a lump sum as soon as administratively practical after the date of such Non-Retirement Termination, per the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. The form of distributionlump sum or installmentsmust be specified at the time the Election Form is completed if an Initial Distribution Election Form is not already on file. If no form of distribution is elected, the distribution shall be in a lump sum. However, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if the Committee reasonably determines that an Employee also is a "specified employee" for purposes of Code Section 409A, then no distribution shall occur until a date no earlier than 6 months following the date of the Employee's Non-Retirement Termination.
(d) In the event of the Employee's death, the Shares attributable to his or her Deferred Stock Unit Account will be distributed to the Employee's beneficiaries in a single lump sum within 60 days after the Company receives written notice of such event, including any unpaid installments if distributions are currently being made. If the Employee has previously filed a beneficiary form with the Company (the "Initial Beneficiary Form"), the Initial Beneficiary Form will determine who the Employee's beneficiaries are and the amount of the distribution they receive. If the Employee has not previously filed a beneficiary form but has completed the beneficiary form to which these Terms and Conditions are attached (the "Beneficiary Form"), this Beneficiary Form will determine who the Employee's beneficiaries are and the amount of the distribution they receive. If the Employee did not provide a beneficiary form to Company before the Employee's death, or if no designated beneficiary survives the Employee, the Shares will be distributed according to the order of priority specified in the Deferred Compensation Plan effective at the time of the Employee's death.
(e) In the event that fractional Shares are in the Employee's Deferred Stock Unit Account, the number of Deferred Stock Units may be rounded down to the next whole Share.
7. .
Employee's Rights Unsecured
The right of the Employee or his or her beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company, and neither the Employee nor his or her beneficiary shall have any rights in or against any amounts credited to the Employee's Accounts or any other specific assets of the Company. All amounts credited to the Employee's Accounts shall constitute general assets of the Company and may be disposed of by the Company at such time and for such purposes as it may deem appropriate. The Company may, pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Deferred Compensation Plan, fund amounts to be paid under this Agreement.
8. . The Employee's Deferred Stock Unit Account, and the rights and privileges conferred hereby may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated (by operation of law or otherwise) other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.
Nontransferability
9. The delivery of all or any of the Shares shall only be effective at such time that the issuance of such Shares will not violate any state or federal securities or other laws. The Company is under no obligation to effect any registration of Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 or to effect any state registration or qualification of the Shares. The Company may, in its sole discretion, delay the delivery of the Shares or place restrictive legends on such Shares in order to ensure that the issuance of any Shares will be in compliance with federal or state securities laws and the rules of the Nasdaq or any other exchange upon which the Company's Shares are traded. If the Company delays the delivery of the Shares in order to ensure compliance with any state or federal securities or other laws, the Company shall deliver the Shares at the earliest date at which the Company reasonably believes that such delivery will not cause such violation, or at such other date that may be permitted under Code Section 409A.
Securities Law Compliance
.
10. . To the extent permitted under Code Section 409A, if the delivery of all or any of the Shares would be nondeductible under Code Section 162(m), then notwithstanding anything in these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, the delivery of such Shares may be delayed until the earliest date at which the Company reasonably anticipates that its deduction as a compensation expense under Code Section 162(m) will not be limited.
