NEWSRELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 12, 2006
COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN) announced today two items that will result in a net positive impact of $0.19 per common share on 2006 third quarter results.
Federal income tax expense for the 2006 third quarter will be reduced by $84.5 million or $0.35 per common share. This reflects the recent resolution of a federal income tax audit covering tax years 2002 and 2003 that resulted in the release of previously established federal income tax reserves, as well as the recognition of federal tax loss carry backs.
Additionally, the company has reviewed $2.1 billion of its investment securities portfolio. The objective of this review is to reposition the portfolio in order to optimize performance in light of changing economic conditions and other factors. Such repositioning will likely result in the sale of these securities and reinvestment into new securities expected to maximize performance and to improve the overall risk profile. Management expects this repositioning will improve the net interest margin in coming quarters. The securities have been identified where there is no longer the positive intent to hold to recovery. At September 30, 2006, these securities had total unrealized losses of $57.5 million ($37.4 million after tax or $0.16 per common share), which has been recognized in the 2006 third quarter results.
Including the $0.19 per common share net benefit of these two items, 2006 third quarter earnings are expected to be $0.65 per common share.
Huntington confirmed it will report its third quarter earnings as previously scheduled on Thursday, October 19, 2006 prior to the market opening. A news release and supporting financial data will be available at that time on Huntington's website at .
