Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
      COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; ) reported 2006 third quarter earnings of $157.4 million, or $0.65 per common share. As previously announced, 2006 third quarter earnings included a $0.19 per common share net benefit related to a favorable resolution of a federal income tax audit, partially offset by the recognition of investment securities impairment. Results in the year-ago third quarter were $108.6 million, or $0.47 per common share.
www.huntington.com
      Earnings for the first nine months of 2006 were $373.5 million, or $1.56 per common share, compared with $311.5 million, or $1.33 per common share, in 2005.
      Highlights compared with the 2006 second quarter included:
 
      "The net impact of the reduction of federal income taxes and securities impairment had a significant favorable impact to reported third quarter results and were positive developments for the company," said Thomas E. Hoaglin, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "The significant increase in our period end capital ratios provides us with additional capital flexibility and the repositioning of our investment securities portfolio is expected to result in a lift to our net interest margin going forward."
      "Even without the net impact of these two items, underlying earnings were slightly better than expected," he noted. "Growth in important fee income items, lower expenses, and steady credit quality helped counter the negative impacts of a decline in our net interest margin and the challenging environment for loan and deposit growth. We continue to believe we can compete effectively to win our fair share of loan and deposit growth opportunities, but are committed to continued discipline in both price and underwriting standards."
THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE DISCUSSION
Significant Factors Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons
      Specific significant items impacting 2006 third quarter performance included :
(see Table 1 below)
 
Table 1  Significant Items Impacting Earnings Performance Comparisons
(1)
 
Investment Securities Portfolio Repositioning
      Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company initiated a review of its investment securities portfolio. The objective of this review is to reposition the portfolio to optimize performance in light of changing economic conditions and other factors. Such repositioning will likely result in the sale of securities and the reinvestment into securities expected to improve the predictability of cash flows and reduce credit risk. A total of $2.1 billion of securities, primarily consisting of U.S. Treasury and Agency securities as well as certain other asset-backed securities, were identified for impairment as part of this review. At September 30, 2006, these securities had total unrealized losses of $57.5 million ($37.4 million after tax, or $0.16 per common share), which has been recognized in the 2006 third quarter results. Management expects this repositioning will improve the net interest margin by 5-6 basis points in coming quarters.
Net Interest Income, Net Interest Margin, Loans and Leases, and Investment Securities
2006 Third Quarter versus 2005 Third Quarter
      Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $14.0 million, or 6% ($17.7 million merger-related), from the year-ago quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of a $2.6 billion, or 9%, increase in average earning assets, as the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin declined 9 basis points to 3.22%. Average total loans and leases increased $1.9 billion, or 8% ($1.7 billion merger-related). The remaining increase in average total loans and leases was $0.2 billion, up less than 1% from the year-ago quarter, which primarily reflected growth in commercial loans, residential mortgages, and home equity loans, mostly offset by a decline in total average automobile loans and leases as we continued a program to sell a portion of that production.
 
      Average total commercial loans increased $1.4 billion, or 14% ($0.8 billion merger-related). This growth reflected a $0.9 billion, or 19%, increase in average middle market C&I loans, a $0.3 billion, or 8%, increase in average commercial real estate loans, and a $0.3 billion, or 12%, increase in average small business loans.
      Average residential mortgages increased $0.6 billion, or 14% ($0.4 billion merger-related). Average home equity loans increased $0.2 billion, or 5%, substantially all from the Unizan merger.
      Compared with the year-ago quarter, average total automobile loans and leases decreased $0.4 billion, or 10%, with the Unizan merger having no significant impact. The decrease reflected the combination of two factors: (1) continued softness in production levels over this period from low consumer demand and competitive pricing, and (2) the sale of automobile loans as we continued a program of selling a portion of current loan production. Average automobile operating lease assets declined $0.2 billion, or 76%, as this portfolio continued to run off. Total automobile loan and lease exposure at quarter end was 15%, down from 19% a year ago.
      Average total investment securities increased $0.9 billion from the 2005 third quarter, attributed, in part, to securities purchased in the 2006 first quarter.
2006 Third Quarter versus 2006 Second Quarter
      Compared with the 2006 second quarter, fully taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $6.8 million, or 3%. This primarily reflected the negative impact of a 12 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 3.22% as average total earnings assets increased less than one percent. The decline in the net interest margin reflected a combination of factors, but primarily related to continued aggressive deposit pricing in the marketplace, the movement of lower cost deposits into higher cost certificates of deposit, and compression in home equity loans spreads.
      Average total loans and leases increased $0.1 billion, or less than 1%, from the 2006 second quarter.
      Average total commercial loans increased slightly. This primarily reflected growth in average middle market C&I loans as utilization rates increased.
      Average residential mortgages increased $0.1 billion, or 3%, with average home equity loans increasing slightly. The growth in average residential mortgages and home equity loans was negatively impacted by a planned decline in home equity broker-originated production, and a continued focus on credit underwriting and pricing discipline despite aggressive price competition.
      Compared with the 2006 second quarter, average total automobile loans and leases declined 2%. The decline reflected a combination of factors including low demand for leases, as well as sales of a portion of automobile loan and lease production. Average direct financing leases declined $0.1 billion, or 6%. Direct financing lease production decreased 16% from the prior quarter, with the absolute level of production over the last several quarters remaining at historically low levels due to continued low consumer demand and competitive pricing. In contrast, average automobile loans increased 2% despite automobile loan production decreasing
 
1% from the prior quarter. Average automobile operating lease assets declined as this portfolio continued to run off with average balances approaching an immaterial level.
      Average investment securities decreased $0.1 billion, or 2%, from the 2006 second quarter.
Deposits
2006 Third Quarter versus 2005 Third Quarter
      Average total core deposits in the 2006 third quarter increased $2.0 billion, or 12% ($1.5 billion merger-related), from the year-ago quarter. Most of the increase reflected higher average core certificates of deposit, which increased $1.8 billion ($0.6 billion merger-related) resulting from continued customer demand for higher, fixed rate deposit products. Average interest bearing demand deposits increased $0.3 billion ($0.2 billion merger-related) and average non-interest bearing deposits increased $0.1 billion ($0.2 billion merger-related). Average savings and other domestic time deposits declined $0.2 billion despite $0.5 billion of growth related to the Unizan merger.
2006 Third Quarter versus 2006 Second Quarter
      Average total core deposits in the 2006 third quarter increased less than 1%, reflecting growth in average total commercial core deposits, mostly offset by a decline in average total consumer core deposits. Average core certificates of deposits increased $0.3 billion, or 5%, reflecting the continued preference of customers for higher fixed rate certificates of deposit compared with lower rate savings and other time deposits, which declined 6%. This shift reflected the same factors impacting comparisons to the year-ago quarter noted above. Average interest bearing deposits increased 1%, whereas average non-interest bearing demand deposits declined 2%.
Non-Interest Income
2006 Third Quarter versus 2005 Third Quarter
      Non-interest income decreased $62.8 million from the year-ago quarter, including a $19.2 million decline in automobile operating lease income. That portfolio continued to run off since no automobile operating leases have been originated since April 2002. Non-interest income before automobile operating lease income decreased $43.6 million, or 33%, reflecting:
Partially offset by:
 
      Table 2 shows that on a reported basis non-interest income declined 39% from the year-ago period. However, when third quarter reported total non-interest income for both years is adjusted to exclude automobile operating lease income and the 2006 third quarter impact of the investment securities impairment and Unizan merger-related non-interest income, non-interest income increased 5% from the year-ago quarter. Management views this adjusted measure as more indicative of underlying non-interest income performance and is used for measuring the effectiveness of strategies to grow fee income.
Table 2  Non-interest Income Analysis
 
2006 Third Quarter versus 2006 Second Quarter
      Non-interest income decreased $65.1 million from the 2006 second quarter including the impact of a $3.6 million decline in automobile operating lease income as that portfolio continued to run off. Non-interest income before automobile operating lease income declined $61.5 million reflecting:
 
Partially offset by:
      Table 3 shows that on a reported basis non-interest income declined 40% from the 2006 second quarter. However, when 2006 third and second quarter reported total non-interest income is adjusted to exclude automobile operating lease income and the 2006 third quarter impact of the investment securities impairment, non-interest income declined 3%. Management views this adjusted measure as more indicative of underlying non-interest income performance for the 2006 third quarter compared with the prior quarter.
Table 3  Non-interest Income Analysis
Non-Interest Expense
2006 Third Quarter versus 2005 Third Quarter
      While non-interest expense increased $9.4 million, or 4%, from the year-ago quarter, automobile operating lease expense declined $15.6 million as that portfolio continued to run off. As a result, non-interest expense before automobile operating lease expense increased $25.0 million, or 12%, from the year-ago quarter, with $18.1 million attributable to Unizan ($17.6 million merger-related plus $0.3 million of merger integration costs). The primary drivers of the $25.0 million increase were:
 
Partially offset by:
      Discerning underlying non-interest expense performance trends requires adjusting reported non-interest expense so expenses in different periods can be analyzed on a comparable basis. Excluding automobile operating lease expense is helpful because its decline may overstate the impact of expense control efforts. Conversely, the merger with Unizan, as well as the share-based compensation that began in 2006, adds significant on-going expenses that did not exist in the 2005 third quarter and may thus understate the impact of expense control efforts.
      Table 4 shows that when third quarter reported total non-interest expense is adjusted to exclude automobile operating lease expense, share-based compensation expense, merger-related expenses including the increase in intangible amortization resulting from the merger, and merger integration costs, underlying non-interest expense increased 1% from the year-ago quarter.
Table 4  Non-interest Expense Analysis
 
2006 Third Quarter versus 2006 Second Quarter
      Non-interest expense decreased $9.9 million from the 2006 second quarter including a $2.7 million decline in automobile operating lease expense as that portfolio continued to run off. Non-interest expense before automobile operating lease expense declined $7.3 million, or 3%, reflecting:
 
Partially offset by:
      Table 5 shows that when 2006 third and second quarter reported total non-interest expense is adjusted to exclude automobile operating lease expense and Unizan merger-related integration costs in the current period, non-interest expense decreased 2% from the 2006 second quarter.
Table 5  Non-interest Expense Analysis
Operating Leverage
      A long-term objective of Management is to increase earnings primarily by growing revenues faster than expenses. Operating leverage measures the difference between these two growth rates. However, over any given measurement period, certain items may occur that distort reported revenue or expense trends. As such, reported revenue and expenses are adjusted so that the two measurement periods are on as much of a comparable basis as possible. This permits a clearer analysis of Management's ability to achieve the long-term objective of generating positive operating leverage .
(see Basis of Presentation  Operating Leverage for a full discussion of the adjustment criteria methodology)
2006 Third Quarter versus 2005 Third Quarter
      Reported total revenues in the 2006 third quarter decreased 12% from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the negative impact of the investment securities impairment in the current period. Reported total non-interest expense increased 4%. As a result, reported operating leverage for the 2006 third quarter compared with the year-ago quarter was a negative 16%. However, on an adjusted basis, revenue increased 7%, and adjusted expenses increased 8%, resulting in negative operating leverage of 1% .
(see Table 6)
 
Table 6  Operating Leverage Analysis

2006 Nine Months versus 2005 Nine Months
      While operating leverage is measured quarterly, the corporate objective is to create positive operating leverage annually. As such, reviewing operating leverage on a year-to-date basis provides insight into progress toward this annual goal. On a reported basis, revenue for the first nine months declined 2%, reflecting the negative impacts of investment securities impairment in the current quarter and the continued decline in automobile operating lease assets as discussed above. Since reported expenses declined 1%, this resulted in 1% negative operating leverage on a reported basis. However, on an adjusted basis, revenues increased 9% and expenses rose 6%, resulting in 3% positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the first nine months of 2006.

Income Taxes
      The provision for income taxes in the 2006 third quarter was a negative $60.8 million. This reflected an $84.5 million reduction of federal income tax expense related to the resolution of a federal income tax audit covering tax years 2002 and 2003 that resulted in the release of previously established federal income tax reserves, as well as the recognition of federal tax loss carry backs. The provision for income taxes in the year-ago-quarter and 2006 second quarter was $43.1 million and $45.5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the 2006 fourth quarter is expected to increase to a more typical rate just below 30%.
Credit Quality
      Total net charge-offs for the 2006 third quarter were $21.2 million, or an annualized 0.32% of average total loans and leases. While this performance remained below the long-term targeted range of 0.35%-0.45%, it was higher than $18.0 million, or an annualized 0.29%, in the year-ago quarter and $14.0 million, or an annualized 0.21%, of average total loans and leases in the 2006 second quarter. The higher level of net charge-offs in the third quarter compared with the second quarter reflected $2.3 million of charge-offs related to the sale of non-performing loans and for which reserves had been previously established. The lower level of net charge-offs in the 2006 second quarter also reflected higher recoveries in that period.
      Total commercial net charge-offs in the third quarter were $6.8 million, or an annualized 0.23%, up $2.6 million from $4.3 million, or an annualized 0.16%, in the year-ago quarter. Current period commercial net charge-offs included $2.3 million related to the sale of non-performing commercial loans for which reserves had been previously established. Compared with the 2006 second quarter, current period total commercial net charge-offs increased $3.4 million.
      Total consumer net charge-offs in the current quarter were $14.4 million, up $0.7 million from $13.7 million in the year-ago quarter. However, when expressed as an annualized percentage, total consumer net charge-offs in the 2006 third quarter were 0.40% of average related loans, unchanged from the year-ago quarter. Compared with the 2006 second quarter, total consumer net charge-offs increased $3.9 million from $10.5 million, with a 10 basis point increase in the annualized net charge-off ratio to 0.40% from 0.30% of average related loans, reflecting a $2.0 million increase in home equity loan net charge-offs.
 
      NPAs were $171.2 million at September 30, 2006, and represented 0.65% of related assets, which was essentially unchanged from June 30, 2006, but up $69.4 million from $101.8 million, or 0.42% of related assets, at the end of the year-ago quarter. Contributing to the $69.4 million increase in NPAs from the year-ago period were $32.8 million of NPLs acquired at the time of the Unizan merger, as well as a $29.8 million increase in other real estate owned (OREO). The increase in OREO included $16.4 million increase in foreclosed mortgage loans fully guaranteed by the U.S. government, which prior to the 2006 second quarter were previously reported as over 90-day delinquent but still accruing loans. This change in reporting also contributed to the $26.9 million increase in total NPLs guaranteed by the U.S. government, from $6.8 million at the end of the 2006 second quarter to $33.7 million at September 30, 2006. At September 30, 2006, 59% of total NPAs represented residential real estate assets and loans guaranteed by the U.S. Government, both of which have shown low, or no, loss content historically. This compares favorably with the 42% level of such NPAs at the end of the year-ago quarter, and 53% at June 30, 2006.
      NPLs, which exclude OREO, increased $39.6 million from the year-earlier period to $129.3 million at September 30, 2006, with $32.8 million of the increase represented by NPLs acquired in the Unizan merger. NPLs declined $6.0 million, or 4%, from June 30, 2006. NPLs expressed as a percent of total loans and leases were 0.49% at September 30, 2006, up from 0.37% a year earlier, but down slightly from 0.51% at June 30, 2006.
      The over 90-day delinquent, but still accruing, ratio was 0.24% at September 30, 2006, up slightly from 0.21% at the end of the year-ago quarter, and from 0.19% at June 30, 2006.
Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL) and Loan Loss Provision
      We maintain two reserves, both of which are available to absorb probable credit losses: the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC). When summed together, these reserves constitute the total ACL.
      At September 30, 2006, the ALLL was $280.2 million, $26.2 million higher than $253.9 million a year earlier, but $7.4 million lower than $287.5 million at June 30, 2006. Expressed as a percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at September 30, 2006, was 1.06%, up from 1.04% a year ago, but down slightly from 1.09% at June 30, 2006. The level of required loan loss reserves is determined using a highly quantitative methodology, which determines the required levels for both the transaction reserve and economic reserve components. Table 8 shows the change in the ALLL ratio and each reserve component for the 2006 second and third quarters, as well as the 2005 third quarter.
Table 8  Components of ALLL as Percent of Total Loans and Leases
 
      The decline in the transaction reserve component at September 30, 2006, from the end of the second quarter, primarily reflected the sale or payoffs of certain NPAs at losses below previously established specific reserve levels. This resulted in the release of excess specific reserves
 
associated with these NPAs.
      The ALLL as a percent of NPLs was 217% at September 30, 2006, down from 283% a year ago, but up from 213% at June 30, 2006. The ALLL as a percent of NPAs was 164% at September 30, 2006, down from 249% a year ago, and down slightly from 168% at June 30, 2006. At June 30, 2006, the AULC was $39.3 million, up from $38.1 million at the end of the year-ago quarter, and from $38.9 million at June 30, 2006.
      On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases at September 30, 2006, was 1.21%, up from 1.19% a year ago, but down slightly from June 30, 2006. The ACL as a percent of NPAs was 187% at September 30, 2006, down from 287% a year earlier and 191% at June 30, 2006. The decline in the NPA coverage ratio reflected a number of factors, but especially the lower potential loss content of NPAs at the end of the current period compared with the prior year period as noted above, given the higher percentage of NPAs represented by residential real estate assets and U.S. Government guaranteed loans noted above.
Capital
      At September 30, 2006, the tangible equity to assets ratio was 7.11%, down from 7.39% a year ago but up from 6.48% at June 30, 2006. At September 30, 2006, the tangible equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was 7.94%, down from 8.19% at the end of the year-ago quarter but up from 7.29% at June 30, 2006.
      The decline in capital ratios from the year-ago period reflected the repurchase of 18.1 million shares over this 12-month period. However, during the quarter, no shares of common stock were repurchased in accordance with the terms of the 6.0 million share accelerated share repurchase program announced May 25, 2006. Under terms of that program, no additional open market purchases could be made until that program expired at the end of September 2006. There are currently 6.9 million shares remaining available under the current share repurchase authorization announced April 20, 2006. The company may make additional share purchases from time-to-time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions.
2006 OUTLOOK
      When earnings guidance is given, it is the company's practice to do so on a GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Such guidance includes the expected results of all significant forecasted activities. However, guidance typically excludes potential unusual, one-time items, or selected items where the timing and financial impact is uncertain until the impact can be reasonably forecasted.
      Below is a list of more specific 2006 fourth quarter performance assumptions, most of which are consistent with prior guidance in July 2006:
 
 
      Within this type of environment, and given actual nine-month 2006 GAAP earnings of $1.56 per share, targeted full-year 2006 GAAP earnings is $2.00-$2.02 per common share.

Forward-looking Statement
      This press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, and projections, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. A number of factors, including but not limited to those set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" included in Item 1A of Huntington's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, and other factors described from time to time in Huntington's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this news release are based on information available at the time of the release. Huntington assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      This earnings release contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this release or in the Quarterly Financial Review supplement to this earnings release, which can be found on Huntington's website at huntington-ir.com.
Operating Leverage
      A long-term objective of Management is to increase earnings by growing revenues faster than expenses over a certain measured period, typically annually. Operating leverage measures the difference between the two growth rates; e.g., if revenues grow 6% and expenses grow 4%, 2% positive operating leverage is generated. However, over any given measurement period, certain items may occur that distort reported revenue or expense trends. For example, the introduction of a new accounting standard might distort the current period's reported revenue growth rate. Similarly, an acquisition may result in certain reported merger-related charges that distort longer-term underlying expense performance trends. Therefore, to determine a clearer picture of underlying trends in operating leverage, Management adjusts reported revenues and/or expenses to remove the impact of such items that affect comparability and distort underlying operating leverage performance. This results in an adjusted operating leverage measurement, which helps Management and investors better understand core performance trends.
      Specific adjustments we consider include:
 
Estimating the Impact on Balance Sheet and Income Statement Results Due to the Unizan Merger
      The merger with Unizan Financial Corp. (Unizan) was completed on March 1, 2006. At the time of acquisition, Unizan had assets of $2.5 billion, including $1.6 billion of loans, and core deposits of $1.5 billion. Unizan results were only in consolidated results for a partial quarter in the 2006 first quarter but fully impact all quarters thereafter. As a result, performance comparisons between 2006 third quarter and year-to-date periods with comparable 2005 periods are affected, as Unizan results were not in the prior period. In contrast, comparisons between the 2006 third and second quarter results are not affected given Unizan fully impacted both of these quarters. Comparisons of the 2006 third quarter and year-to-date reported results compared with 2005 pre-merger reporting periods are impacted as follows:
      Given the impact of the merger on reported 2006 results, management believes that an understanding of the impacts of the merger is necessary to better understand underlying performance trends. When comparing post-merger period results to pre-merger periods, two terms relating to the impact of the Unizan merger on reported results are used:
 
Balance Sheet Items
      For loans and leases, as well as core deposits, balances as of the acquisition date are pro-rated to the post-merger period being used in the comparison. To estimate the impact on 2006 first quarter average balances, one-third of the closing date balance was used as those balances were in reported results for only one month of the quarter. Full quarter and year-to-date estimated impacts for subsequent periods were developed using this same pro-rata methodology. This methodology assumes acquired balances will remain constant over time.
Income Statement Items
      For income statement line items, Unizan's actual full year results for 2005 were used for pro-rating the impact on post-merger periods. For example, to estimate the 2006 first quarter impact of the merger on personnel costs, one-twelfth of Unizan's full-year 2005 personnel costs was used. Full quarter and year-to-date estimated impacts for subsequent periods were developed using this same pro-rata methodology. This results in an approximate impact since the methodology does not adjust for any unusual items or seasonal factors in Unizan's 2005 reported results, or synergies realized since the merger date. The one exception to this methodology relates to the amortization of intangibles expense where the actual post-merger amount was used.
      Table 9 below provides detail of changes to selected reported results to quantify the impact of the Unizan merger and the impact of all other factors using this methodology:
Table 9  Estimated Impact of Unizan Merger
2006 Third Quarter versus 2005 Third Quarter
2006 Third Quarter versus 2005 Third Quarter
 
2006 Nine Months versus 2005 Nine Months
 
Annualized data
      Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are "annualized" in this presentation to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
      Income from tax-exempt earnings assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
      Significant and/or one-time income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of significant and/or one-time items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is separately disclosed, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
NM or nm
      Percent changes of 100% or more are shown as "nm" or "not meaningful". Such large percent changes typically reflect the impact of one-time items within the measured periods. Since the primary purpose of showing a percent change is for discerning underlying performance trends, such large percent changes are "not meaningful" for this purpose.
