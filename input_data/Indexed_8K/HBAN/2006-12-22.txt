Item 1.01    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Merger Agreement
     
On December 20, 2006, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, a Maryland corporation ("
Huntington
"), Sky Financial Group, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("
Sky
"), and Penguin Acquisition, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Huntington ("
Merger Sub
"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
Merger Agreement
"), pursuant to which Sky will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the "
Merger
"). Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of Sky will cease, and Merger Sub will be the surviving company. The Merger has been approved by the Board of Directors of both Huntington and Sky.
     
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, without par value, of Sky ("
Sky Common Stock"
), will be converted into the right to receive 1.098 shares of common stock, without par value, of Huntington ("
Huntington Common Stock
"), and $3.023 in cash, without interest (collectively, the "
Merger Consideration
"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, (i) each outstanding option to acquire Sky Common Stock will immediately vest and become exercisable and will be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Huntington Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Sky Common Stock underlying such option immediately prior to the Merger multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), with an exercise price that equals the exercise price of such option immediately prior to the Merger divided by the Exchange Ratio; (ii) each restricted share of Sky Common Stock will immediately vest and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to applicable withholding tax; and (iii) each stock unit denominated in shares of Sky Common Stock will immediately vest and be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Huntington Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Sky Common Stock underlying such unit immediately prior to the Merger multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.
"" is the sum of (x) 1.098 and (y) the quotient of 3.023 divided by the average closing sale price of Huntington Common Stock over the five trading days immediately preceding the Merger.
Exchange Ratio
     
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. The covenants of the parties include, subject to certain exceptions, covenants not to (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any alternative transaction, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an alternative transaction, or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding an alternative transaction. In addition, each party has agreed to submit the transaction to its stockholders for approval and use reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval.
     
The consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including obtaining the required approvals from the holders of Huntington Common Stock and Sky Common Stock, the absence of any legal prohibition on consummation of the Merger, obtaining required governmental and regulatory approvals, effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, approval of Huntington's common stock to be issued in the Merger for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties to the Merger Agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement), material performance of all the covenants of the parties to the Merger Agreement, and the delivery of customary legal opinions as to the federal tax treatment of the Merger. In addition, Huntington's obligation to close is subject to the condition that none of the required governmental or regulatory approvals results in the imposition of conditions that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Huntington and Sky taken as a whole after the Merger.
     
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, the Board of Directors of Huntington will consist of fifteen members comprised of (i) Mr. Thomas Hoaglin, the current chief executive officer of Huntington, plus nine current non-employee directors of Huntington designated by Huntington and (ii) Mr. Marty Adams, the current chief executive officer of Sky, plus four current non-employee directors of Sky designated by Sky. At the effective time of the Merger, Mr. Hoaglin will continue to serve as Huntington's chief executive officer and the chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mr. Adams will become Huntington's president and chief operating officer. Mr. Adams will be the successor to Mr. Hoaglin as chief executive officer of Huntington on December 31, 2009 or such earlier date as of which Mr. Hoaglin ceases for any reason to serve as chief executive officer of
Huntington. The above provisions will be contained in a bylaw provision that until December 31, 2009 can only be amended by an affirmative vote of at least 75% of the directors that constitute the entire Board of Directors of Huntington.
     
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights of Huntington and Sky and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Huntington and Sky may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $125 million.
     
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the Merger does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.
     
The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Sky, Huntington, or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of each of Sky, on the one hand, and Huntington and Merger Sub, on the other hand, made solely for the benefit of the other. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules that the parties have exchanged in connection with signing the Merger Agreement. The disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between Sky, on the one hand, and Huntington and Merger Sub, on the other hand. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Sky, Huntington or Merger Sub.
Item 8.01    Other Events.
     
On December 20, 2006, Huntington and Sky issued a joint press release announcing that they had entered into the Merger Agreement. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Section 2.2(b)(i)
, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions as contemplated by
Section 2.2(b)
.
     
(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Huntington Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Huntington Common Stock is to be issued in, or any cash is paid to, a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance or payment thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

Article II
.
     
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Huntington Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Huntington Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Huntington.

Article II
shall
thereafter look only to Huntington for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions payable in accordance with
Section 2.2(b)
in respect of each share of Sky Common Stock, as the case may be, such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Huntington, Merger Sub, Sky, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Sky Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
     
(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Huntington, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Huntington may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
     
2.3

Section 2.2(b)
hereof and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Sky Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Huntington, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Huntington, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Sky Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Huntington, as the case may be.

Article III
, or to one or more of Sky's covenants contained herein,
provided

Hoaglin, Huntington's chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "Importantly, it provides significant benefits to Huntington's shareholders and customers. For shareholders, this transaction is immediately accretive to 2007 earnings and is expected to add 4% to earnings in 2008. Further, the value of the expense efficiencies that can be gained will exceed the premium we are paying."
     "As a result of the merger, Huntington will become the 24 largest domestically-controlled bank in the country," he continued. "In Ohio, we will be the third largest bank in deposits with more banking offices prior to consolidation than any other bank, on a combined pro-forma basis based on data as of September 30, 2006. We will rank #1 in deposit market share in Columbus, Toledo, Youngstown, and Canton, and our market shares will be strengthened in Cleveland and other Northeast and Northwest Ohio markets. We will also become the third largest bank in Indianapolis, one of the faster growing Midwest markets. In addition, Sky Financial Group provides entry into new markets including Western Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh. We look forward to welcoming Sky Financial Group's customers and associates to the Huntington family."
th
     "Retaining Sky Financial Group's customers and local management are key objectives," Hoaglin noted. "We have known Sky's senior executives for a number of years and their addition strengthens Huntington's overall management team. A hallmark of Sky has been their success in developing a strong sales culture, and we expect to leverage this expertise. Their culture of local-decision making and their customer base are similar to our own. We also share a passion for community involvement, and this merger will provide additional resources that can be delivered locally."
     Also commenting on the transaction, Marty Adams, Sky Financial Group's chairman, president, and chief executive officer, said, "This is an exciting transaction that provides Sky shareholders with immediate value, as well as the opportunity to participate in the upside potential created by bringing together our two strong financial institutions. Both companies have deep-rooted ties to the communities in which we operate and share a commitment to delivering the best products and services to our customers locally. We expect this transaction to benefit our loyal customers significantly by giving them added convenience and access to Huntington's many services, including its proven wealth and investment management expertise."
     Adams continued, "This is an important day in the history of Sky Financial, and on behalf of our board and management, I want all of our employees to know how much we recognize and appreciate the integral role they have played in our growth and success."
     Hoaglin and Adams noted that they are committed to a seamless transition for Sky Financial Group's customers. Huntington and Sky Financial will initiate an extensive communication outreach program to ensure that all customers are informed prior to any changes resulting from the merger.
