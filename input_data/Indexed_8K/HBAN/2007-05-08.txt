     (f) During the period beginning from the date of the Prospectus, and continuing to and including the date 30 days after the date hereof, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Trust Preferred Securities (except for the Trust Preferred Securities offered hereby,), any other beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust (other than the Trust Common Securities) or any Junior Subordinated Notes, any securities (including any security issued by another trust or other limited purpose vehicle) that are substantially similar to the Trust Preferred Securities, the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Guarantee, or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive any such substantially similar securities of either the Trust, a similar trust or the Guarantor, except with your prior written consent;
     (g) To pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Trust Preferred Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Act;
     (h) To use the net proceeds received from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities or Junior Subordinated Notes, as the case may be, in the

     (i) The Guarantor will issue the Guarantee and the Junior Subordinated Notes concurrently with the issue and sale of the Trust Preferred Securities as contemplated herein.
     6.
     (a) (i) The Guarantor and the Trust each represents and agrees that, other than the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, without the prior consent of the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Trust Preferred Securities and the Junior Subordinated Notes that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act;
     (ii) each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Guarantor and the Representatives, other than one or more term sheets relating to the Trust Preferred Securities and Junior Subordinated Notes containing customary information (which, in their final form, will not be inconsistent with the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof) and conveyed to purchasers of Trust Preferred Securities, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Trust Preferred Securities and the Junior Subordinated Notes that would constitute a free writing prospectus; and
     (iii) any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Guarantor and the Representatives (including the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof) is listed on Schedule II(a) or Schedule II(b) hereto;
     (b) Each of the Trust and the Guarantor has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
     (c) Each of the Trust and the Guarantor agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Guarantor will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
 
writing to the Guarantor by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     7. The Guarantor covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Guarantor will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Guarantor's and the Trust's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Trust Preferred Securities and Junior Subordinated Notes under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Junior Subordinated Notes; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Junior Subordinated Notes for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Trust Preferred Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Trust Preferred Securities and the Junior Subordinated Notes; (viii) the fees and expenses of any trustee and any agent of such trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for such trustee; and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Trust Preferred Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Guarantor and the Trust herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Guarantor and the Trust shall have each performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
     (a) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; the final term sheet contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed by the Guarantor or the Trust pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or
 
any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to your reasonable satisfaction;
     (b) Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to you such written opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, with respect to such matters as the Underwriters may reasonably require, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
     (c) The Guarantor's Senior Corporate Counsel or such other internal counsel as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Underwriters (the "Internal Counsel"), shall have furnished to you such counsel's written opinion (a draft of such opinion is attached as Annex II(a) hereto), dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you;

     (g) Shearman & Sterling LLP, special tax counsel to the Guarantor and the Trust, shall have furnished to you their written opinion (a draft of such opinion is attached as Annex II(e) hereto), dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that (i) subject to the qualifications set forth in the opinion and the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the statements made in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects, and (ii) subject to the qualifications set forth in the opinion and the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus, Shearman & Sterling LLP confirms its opinions set
 
forth in the discussion in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences".
     (h) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement, at 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date of any post effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to you a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex I hereto, (the executed copy of the letter delivered prior to the execution of this Agreement is attached as Annex I(a) hereto and a form of letter to be delivered on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, and as of the Time of Delivery is attached as Annex I(b) hereto);
     (i) (i) Neither the Guarantor nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long term debt of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in your judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Trust Preferred Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
     (j) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Guarantor's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Guarantor's debt securities;
     (k) On or after the Applicable Time there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or on NASDAQ; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Guarantor's securities on NASDAQ; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York, Ohio or Michigan State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the
 
occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in your judgment makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
     (l) The Guarantor shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement;

     9. (a) The Guarantor and the Trust will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Guarantor and the Trust against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Guarantor or the Trust may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the
 
Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Guarantor or the Trust for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Guarantor or the Trust in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute
 
to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Trust Preferred Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Guarantor or the Trust bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Trust Preferred Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Guarantor and the Trust under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Guarantor or the Trust may otherwise
 
have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Guarantor and to each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Trust Preferred Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Trust Preferred Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities, then the Guarantor shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Trust Preferred Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Guarantor that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities, or the Guarantor notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities, you or the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Guarantor agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Trust Preferred Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Trust Preferred Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate liquidation amount of such Trust Preferred Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate liquidation amount of all the Trust Preferred Securities, then the Guarantor shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the liquidation amount of Trust Preferred Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the liquidation amount of the Trust Preferred Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Trust Preferred Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Trust Preferred Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate liquidation
 
amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate liquidation amount of all the Trust Preferred Securities, or if the Guarantor shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Trust Preferred Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Guarantor, the Trust and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Trust, or the Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Trust Preferred Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Trust Preferred Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Trust as provided herein, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Trust Preferred Securities, but the Guarantor and the Trust shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you jointly or by the Representatives on behalf of you as the representatives.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., One New York Plaza, 42nd Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, 1585 Broadway, 29 Floor, New York, New York 10036 Attention: Investment Banking Division; and if to the Guarantor shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Guarantor set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in
th
 
its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Guarantor by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Trust, the Guarantor and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Guarantor and each person who controls the Guarantor or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Trust Preferred Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
     16. The Guarantor and the Trust each acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Trust Preferred Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Guarantor and the Trust, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Guarantor or the Trust, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Guarantor or the Trust with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Guarantor on other matters) or any other obligation to the Guarantor or the Trust except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) each of the Guarantor and the Trust has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. Each of the Guarantor and the Trust agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Guarantor or the Trust, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
     17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Guarantor or the Trust and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
     18. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
     19. The Guarantor, the Trust and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
     20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
     21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Guarantor and the Trust are authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Guarantor or the Trust relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters, imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us one for the Guarantor and each of the Representatives plus one for each counsel counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Guarantor and the Trust. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Guarantor for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

     So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company has the right at any time or from time to time during the term of this Security to defer payment of interest on this Security for one or more consecutive Interest Periods up to 10 years; , that no Deferral Period will extend beyond the Final Repayment Date or the earlier redemption of any Securities of this series. Upon the termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. Except as provided in Section 2.7 of the Supplemental Indenture, no interest will be due and payable during a Deferral Period except at the end thereof.

In addition, if any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the Company will not repurchase or acquire any securities ranking junior to or equal with any of its Qualifying APM Securities the proceeds of which were used to settle deferred interest during the relevant Deferral Period before the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest on this Security has been paid before the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest on this Security has been paid, subject to the exceptions listed above.

     Payment of the principal of and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the United States, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; , that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address will appear in the Securities Register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at the bank account number as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Securities Register in writing not less than ten days before the relevant Interest Payment Date.

For purposes of the opinions set forth below, we have, with the consent of the Trust, relied upon the accuracy of the Prospectus.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, revenue rulings and revenue procedures of the Internal Revenue Service, and other administrative pronouncements, all as in effect on the date hereof, it is our opinion that:
          1. Subject to the qualifications set forth in this opinion and the Prospectus, the statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects. Subject to the qualifications set forth in this opinion and the Prospectus, we confirm our opinions set forth in the discussion in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences."
SHEARMAN & STERLING LLP IS A LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP ORGANIZED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WHICH LAWS LIMIT THE PERSONAL LIABILITY OF PARTNERS.
 
          2. The Trust will be characterized as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes and not as an association taxable as a corporation.
Our opinions are based on current United States federal income tax law and administrative practice, and we do not undertake to advise you as to any future changes in United States federal income tax law or administrative practice that may affect our opinion unless we are specifically retained to do so. Further, legal opinions are not binding upon the Internal Revenue Service and there can be no assurance that contrary positions may not be asserted by the Internal Revenue Service.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to us in the Prospectus. In giving such consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
Very truly yours,
