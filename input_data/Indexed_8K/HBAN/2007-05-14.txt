     This report contains statements that we believe are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder. These statements relate to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as "will likely result," "may," "are expected to," "is anticipated," "estimate," "forecast," "projected," "intends to," or may include other similar words or phrases such as "believes," "plans," "trend," "objective," "continue," "remain," or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," "might," "can," or similar verbs. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in this report, including the risk factors set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements we may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to us.
     There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) competitive pressures on product pricing and services and financial institutions generally; (2) changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins; (3) prepayment rates, loan originations and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions are inherently uncertain; (4) general economic conditions, either nationally or in the states in which we do business, may be less favorable than expected; (5) political developments, wars or other hostilities may disrupt or increase volatility in securities markets or other wise affect economic conditions; (6) changes and trends in the capital markets; (7) the nature, extent and timing of legislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, may adversely affect the businesses in which we are engaged; (8) our ability to maintain favorable ratings from rating agencies; (9) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; (10) changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies; (11) fluctuation of our stock price; (12) ability to attract and retain our key personnel; (13) ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries; (14) potential dilutive effect of future acquisitions on current shareholders' ownership of Huntington; (15) the businesses of Huntington and that of any pending or approved acquisition may not be integrated successfully or such integration may take longer to accomplish than expected; (16) the expected cost savings and any revenue synergies from acquisitions may not be fully realized within the expected timeframes; (17) disruption from acquisitions may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients, associates, or suppliers; (18) the required governmental approvals of acquisitions may not be obtained on the proposed terms and schedule; (19) if required by an acquisition, Huntington and/or the stockholders of any pending or approved acquisition may not approve the acquisition; (20) success and timing of other business strategies; (21) extended disruption of vital infrastructure; (22) ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications network; and (23) the impact of reputational risk created by these developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity.
     You should refer to our periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or "SEC," for further information on other factors which could cause actual results to be significantly different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
