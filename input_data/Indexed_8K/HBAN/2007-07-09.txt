COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN) today announced that it expects to report 2007 second quarter earnings of $0.34 per common share. This includes:
Commenting on the quarter, Thomas E. Hoaglin, chairman and chief executive officer said, "These results were below our expectations and resulted primarily from difficult and deteriorating residential real estate markets. The Spring and early-Summer selling season is important for homebuilders, and while we had expected softness, in the case of East Michigan, it turned out to be far worse than planned. We believe it important to address this situation aggressively. Our loan loss reserve ratio will be about 1.15% at June 30, 2007, up from 1.08% at March 31, 2007."
Huntington expects to report total non-performing assets of about $262 million, a $55 million, or 26%, increase from the end of the prior quarter. The three commercial loan relationships account for $43 million of the net increase. Provision expense in the quarter will exceed net charge-offs by about $26 million, with net charge-offs expected to total $34 million, or 0.52%, of average total loans and leases. The three commercial loan relationships accounted for $12 million, or 0.18%, of charge-offs in the quarter. For the first half of 2007, net charge-offs are expected to represent 0.40% of average total loans and leases.
Commenting on credit quality trends, exclusive of any impact from the Sky Financial acquisition, Hoaglin said, "We expect full-year 2007 net charge-offs will be in the mid- to upper-half of our targeted 0.35%-0.45% range, with commercial net charge-offs remaining under pressure, but consumer portfolio net charge-offs remaining generally stable. We expect moderate increases in our loan loss reserve ratio over the second half of the year."
Huntington confirmed it will report its second quarter earnings as previously scheduled on Thursday, July 19, 2007, prior to the market opening. A news release and supporting financial data will be available at that time on Huntington's website at .
