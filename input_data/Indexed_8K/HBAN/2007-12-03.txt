Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 3, 2007, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated ("Huntington") announced the retirement of Marty Adams as president and chief operating officer effective December 31, 2007. At that time he will also step down as a director of Huntington. For a one-year period following retirement, Mr. Adams will serve as an unpaid consultant to Huntington to assist with transitional matters, including the Franklin Credit Management relationship. Mr. Adams retirement will be treated as a "good reason" termination of employment for purposes of his Employment Agreement with Huntington, dated as of December 20, 2006, as amended on July 17, 2007, and will generally be treated similarly for purposes of other Huntington compensation and benefits arrangements in which Mr. Adams participates. Huntington has agreed to provide Mr. Adams with an office and secretarial support for up to five years following retirement. Thomas Hoaglin, Huntingtons chairman and chief executive officer, will assume the role of president upon Mr. Adams retirement. Huntington also announced that Mr. Hoaglins retirement plans, previously announced in conjunction with the merger, are no longer in effect.
