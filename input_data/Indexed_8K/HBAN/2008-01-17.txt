Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 17, 2008
     COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; ) reported a 2007 fourth quarter net loss of $239.3 million, or $0.65 per common share. This was consistent with the announcement on January 10, 2008. Earnings in the year-ago fourth quarter were $87.7 million, or $0.37 per common share. Earnings in the current and year-ago quarters were impacted by several significant items .
www.huntington.com
(see Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons discussion and Table 1)
     Earnings for the full year 2007 were $75.2 million, or $0.25 per common share, compared with $461.2 million, or $1.92 per common share in 2006.
     Huntington also announced yesterday that the board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $0.265 per common share. The dividend is payable April 1, 2008, to shareholders of record on March 14, 2008.
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
     Performance compared with the 2007 third quarter included:
 
     "We are disappointed with these results," said Thomas E. Hoaglin, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "Clearly the biggest setback was the significant negative impact associated with the previously announced restructuring of the Franklin relationship acquired in the Sky Financial merger. However, we firmly believe that the specific reserves we have established and the positive cash flow coverage resulting from the restructuring address fully the current and anticipated financial performance issues associated with this relationship. As such, we do not anticipate any further negative impact from this relationship. Also negatively
 
impacting performance was the need to build non-Franklin-related loan loss reserves in view of the continued weakness in the residential real estate development markets."
     He continued, "While not an excuse, many of the items negatively impacting fourth quarter performance were one-time in nature or reflected the volatile financial markets. The volatility of securities markets, and particularly the negative valuation performance of financial securities, resulted in our market-related losses. When these markets will stabilize is not known. The public equity investment funds and the investment securities portfolio where we have been most negatively impacted have now been written down to less than $25 million."
     "Despite these developments, there were positive signs of the underlying strength of our franchise," he said. "The quarter's results included good growth in commercial loans and strong growth in a number of key fee income activities. Our underlying expenses were well controlled, and we have realized almost 90% of the merger efficiencies and are confident of achieving the rest."
     "Even in this difficult environment, our 2008 expectations are for a net interest margin in the 3.35% range, and growth in loans and fee income. We expect no significant market-related losses and will remain focused on controlling expenses. Credit quality performance will remain under pressure. We expect meaningful progress in building capital ratios. This confidence was evidenced by the reaffirmation of the common stock dividend by our board of directors. We will continue to focus on executing our business plan, and we believe 2008 will be a successful year," he concluded.
FOURTH QUARTER PERFORMANCE DISCUSSION
Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons
     Specific significant items impacting 2007 fourth quarter performance included :
(see Table 1 below)
 
Table 1  Significant Items Impacting Earnings Performance Comparisons
(1)
 
Net Interest Income, Net Interest Margin, and Average Balance Sheet
2007 Fourth Quarter versus 2006 Fourth Quarter
     Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $126.2 million from the year-ago quarter. This reflected the favorable impact of a $15.6 billion increase in average earning assets, of which $13.8 billion represented an increase in average loans and leases, partially offset by a slight decrease in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin of 2 basis points to 3.26%. The current quarter net interest margin included a one-time negative impact of 15 basis points, reflecting Franklin loans that were put on nonaccrual status from November 16, 2007 until December 28, 2007. The increases in average earning assets, as well as loans and leases, were primarily merger-related. Table 2 details the $13.8 billion reported increase in average loans and leases.
 
Table 2  Loans and Leases  4Q07 vs. 4Q06
 
     The $1.0 billion, or 3%, non-merger-related increase primarily reflected:
Partially offset by:
     Also contributing to the growth in average earning assets was a $1.0 billion increase in average trading account securities. The increase in these assets reflected a change in our strategy to use trading account securities to hedge the change in fair value of our mortgage servicing rights (MSR).
     The 3.26% fully taxable net interest margin in the current period, which was below our expectations, reflected a one-time negative impact of 15 basis points as the Franklin loans were put on nonaccrual status from November 16, 2007 until December 28, 2007. The margin decline also reflected competitive deposit pricing in our markets.
     Table 3 details the $13.0 billion reported increase in average total deposits.
Table 3  Deposits  4Q07 vs. 4Q06
 
 
     Virtually all of the increase in average total deposits was merger-related. The $0.1 billion non-merger-related increase reflected:
Partially offset by:
2007 Fourth Quarter versus 2007 Third Quarter
     Compared with the 2007 third quarter, fully taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $27.0 million. This reflected the negative impact of a lower fully taxable equivalent net interest margin, only partially offset by an increase in average earning assets, primarily loans. The fully-taxable net interest margin was 3.26% in the quarter, down 26 basis points, of which 15 basis points represented the $17.9 million reduction of interest income as the Franklin loans were put on nonaccrual status from November 16, 2007 until December 28, 2007. The remainder of the decline in the fully taxable net interest margin primarily reflected continued deposit pricing competition in our markets. These negatives were only partially offset by the $0.4 billion increase in average earning assets, of which $0.3 billion represented growth in average total loans and leases.
     Table 4 details the $0.3 billion reported increase in average loans and leases.
Table 4  Loans and Leases  4Q07 vs. 3Q07
     The $0.3 billion, or 1%, increase in average total loans and leases primarily reflected 1% growth in average total commercial loans due to strong growth in middle-market commercial real estate loans. Average total consumer loans were essentially unchanged.
     While average total deposits were essentially unchanged, Table 5 details the changes in the various deposit categories.
 
Table 5  Deposits  4Q07 vs. 3Q07
     Average total deposits were $37.7 billion, essentially unchanged compared with the prior quarter. However, there were changes between the various deposit account categories consisting of:
Provision for Credit Losses
     The provision for credit losses in the 2007 fourth quarter was $512.1 million, up from $15.7 million in the year-ago quarter and from $42.0 million in the third quarter. Compared with the 2007 third quarter, the $470.1 million increase included $405.8 million related to Franklin. Reported 2007 net charge-offs were $377.9 million, including $308.5 million related to Franklin. As a result, the reported provision for credit losses exceed net charge-offs by $134.2 million. Adjusting for Franklin-related provision and net charge-offs, the non-Franklin-related provision for credit losses was $106.3 million, or $36.9 million greater than related net charge-offs of $69.4 million. ().
See Credit Quality Discussion
Non-Interest Income
2007 Fourth Quarter versus 2006 Fourth Quarter
     Non-interest income increased $30.0 million from the year-ago quarter. The $68.7 million of merger-related non-interest income drove the increase, as non-merger-related non-interest income declined. Table 6 details the $30.0 million increase in reported total non-interest income.
 
Table 6  Non-interest Income  4Q07 vs. 4Q06
 
     The $38.8 million, or 19%, non-merger-related decline reflected:
Partially offset by:
2007 Fourth Quarter versus 2007 Third Quarter
     Non-interest income decreased $34.1 million from the 2007 third quarter.
 
Table 7  Non-interest Income  4Q07 vs. 3Q07
     This $34.1 million, or 17%, decline reflected:
Partially offset by:
Non-interest Expense
2007 Fourth Quarter versus 2006 Fourth Quarter
     Non-interest expense increased $171.8 million from the year-ago quarter. The $136.6 million of merger-related expenses and $44.4 million of merger costs drove the increase, as non-merger-related expenses declined. Table 8 details the $171.8 million increase in reported total non-interest expense.
 
Table 8  Non-interest Expense  4Q07 vs. 4Q06
 
     The $9.3 million, or 2%, non-merger-related decline reflected:
Partially offset by:
2007 Fourth Quarter versus 2007 Third Quarter
     Non-interest expense increased $54.0 million, or 14%, from the 2007 third quarter, of which $12.2 million represented higher merger costs. Table 9 details the $54.0 million increase in reported total non-interest expense.
Table 9  Non-interest Expense  4Q07 vs. 3Q07
 
 
     The $41.8 million, or 11%, non-merger-related increase reflected a $40.7 million increase in other expense. Contributing to the increase in other expense was the current quarter's $24.9 million VISA indemnification charge, $8.9 million of increases to litigation reserves on existing cases, and higher automobile operating lease expense. In addition, the third quarter other expense was reduced by a $3.2 million debt extinguishment gain.
Income Taxes
     The provision for income taxes in the 2007 fourth quarter was a benefit of $158.9 million. For the full year, the provision for income taxes was a benefit of $52.5 million. The effective tax rate for the 2007 fourth quarter was a tax benefit of 39.9%.
Credit Quality
     In addition to the negative impact from the Franklin restructuring on credit quality performance measures, there was also deterioration in non-Franklin-related loans. This reflected the negative impact of the continued economic weakness in our Midwest markets, most notably among our borrowers in eastern Michigan and northern Ohio, and within the residential real estate development portfolio. Consumer loans also saw negative trends impacted by the softening economy, but less so. These factors resulted in significantly higher absolute and relative levels of net charge-offs (NCOs), non-accrual loans (NALs), and non-performing assets (NPAs). To maintain the adequacy of our reserves, there was a commensurate significant increase in the provision for credit losses in order to increase the absolute and relative levels of our allowances for loan and lease losses (ACL).
(see Provision for Credit Losses discussion)
     Since the Franklin restructuring impacted credit performance metrics significantly, tables in the discussion that follows detail the Franklin impact on those metrics, as well as the performance of the remaining non-Franklin-related loans and leases.
Net Charge-Offs
     Total net charge-offs for the 2007 fourth quarter were $377.9 million, or an annualized 3.77% of average total loans and leases, including $308.5 million due to the Franklin restructuring. There were no Franklin-related net charge-offs in the third quarter. The remaining $69.4 million of net charge-offs that were non-Franklin-related represented an annualized 0.72% of related loans. This compared with net charge-offs of $23.0 million, or an annualized 0.35%, in the year-ago quarter, and $47.1 million, or an annualized 0.47%, in the 2007 third quarter. Table 10 details net charge-off performance:
 
Table 10  Franklin Impact on Net Charge-offs
     Total commercial net charge-offs in the 2007 fourth quarter were $344.6 million, or an annualized 6.18%. Non-Franklin-related total commercial net charge-offs in the current quarter were $36.1 million and represented an annualized 0.70% of related loans. This was higher than an annualized 0.22% in the year-ago period, and the annualized 0.31% in the prior quarter.
     Total consumer net charge-offs in the current quarter were $33.3 million, or an annualized 0.75%. This was higher than an annualized 0.46% in the year-ago period and 0.67% in the prior quarter. Automobile loan and lease net charge-offs were $10.4 million, or an annualized 0.96% in the fourth quarter, up from 0.54% in the year-ago period and 0.73% in the prior period. This increase reflected both the impact of the Sky Financial portfolio, as well as seasonal factors. Residential mortgage net charge-offs were $3.3 million, or an annualized 0.25% of related average balances. This was higher than an annualized 0.19% in the year-ago quarter, but down from an annualized 0.32% in the prior quarter. Home equity net charge-offs in the 2007 fourth quarter were $12.2 million, or an annualized 0.67%, up from an annualized 0.47%, in the year-ago quarter and an annualized 0.58% in the prior quarter. The economic weakness in our markets, most notably among our borrowers in eastern Michigan and northern Ohio, continue to impact residential mortgage and home equity net charge-offs.
Non-accrual Loans and Non-performing Assets
     Non-accrual loans (NALs) were $319.8 million at December 31, 2007, and represented 0.80% of related assets. This compared with $144.1 million, or 0.55%, at the end of the year-ago period, and $249.4 million, or 0.62%, at September 30, 2007. The $70.4 million, or 28%, increase in NALs from the end of the prior quarter reflected a $47.0 million increase in middle market commercial real estate loan NALs, reflecting the continued softness in the residential real estate development markets, particularly among our borrowers in eastern Michigan and northern Ohio, as well as increases in small business and residential mortgage NALs due to the continued overall economic weakness in our markets.
     Non-performing assets (NPAs), which include NALs, were $1.660 billion at December 31, 2007. This compared with $193.6 million at the end of the year-ago period and $435.0 million at September 30, 2007. The $1.225 billion increase in NPAs from the end of the prior quarter
 
reflected:
Partially offset by:
     The over 90-day delinquent, but still accruing, ratio was 0.35% at December 31, 2007, up from 0.23% at the end of the year-ago quarter and from 0.29% at September 30, 2007.
Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)
     We maintain two reserves, both of which are available to absorb probable credit losses: the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC). When summed together, these reserves constitute the total ACL.
     At December 31, 2007, the ALLL was $578.4 million, up from $272.1 million a year ago and from $454.8 million at September 30, 2007. Expressed as a percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at December 31, 2007, was 1.44%, up from 1.04% a year ago and from 1.14% at September 30, 2007. The $123.7 million increase from the end of the prior quarter, included $97.6 million related to Franklin, which increased its specific ALLL to $115.3 million. The remaining $26.1 million increase in the ALLL from the end of the prior quarter primarily reflected declining credit quality in the residential real estate development portfolio.
     The level of required loan loss reserves is determined using a highly quantitative methodology, which determines the required levels for both the transaction reserve and economic reserve components. Table 11 shows the change in the ALLL ratio and each reserve component for the 2007 fourth and third quarters and the 2006 fourth quarter.
Table 11  Components of ALLL as Percent of Total Loans and Leases
 
     The ALLL as a percent of NALs was 181% at December 31, 2007, down from 189% a year ago and from 182% at September 30, 2007. At December 31, 2007, the AULC was $66.5 million, up from $40.2 million at the end of the year-ago quarter, and from $58.2 million at
 
September 30, 2007.
     On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases at December 31, 2007, was 1.61%, up from 1.19% a year ago and from 1.28% at September 30, 2007. The ACL as a percent of NALs was 202% at December 31, 2007, down from 217% a year ago and from 206% at September 30, 2007.
Capital
     At December 31, 2007, the tangible equity to assets ratio was 5.08%, down from 6.93% a year ago, and from 5.70% at September 30, 2007. Of the 62 basis point decline from September 30, 2007, 46 basis points reflected the negative impact of the current quarter's net loss on equity. At December 31, 2007, the tangible equity to risk-weighted assets ratio was 5.70%, down from 7.72% at the end of the year-ago quarter, and from 6.46% at September 30, 2007. These decreases also primarily reflected the negative impact on equity from the current quarter's net loss. The estimated regulatory Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios at December 31, 2007, were 7.55% and 10.89%, respectively, and remained well above the regulatory "well capitalized" minimums of 6.0% and 10.0%, respectively. The "well capitalized" level is the highest regulatory capital designation.
     No shares were repurchased during the quarter. Though there are currently 3.9 million shares remaining available under the current authorization announced April 20, 2006, no future share repurchases are contemplated.
2008 OUTLOOK
     When earnings guidance is given, it is our practice to do so on a GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Such guidance includes the expected results of all significant forecasted activities. However, guidance typically excludes selected items where the timing and financial impact is uncertain until the impact can be reasonably forecasted, as well as potential unusual or one-time items.
     Our expectation for 2008 is that the Midwest economic environment will continue to be negatively impacted by weaknesses in the residential real estate development markets and softness in certain manufacturing sectors. How much these factors will affect banking activities and overall credit quality trends is unknown. However, it is our expectation that the greatest impact will continue to be among our borrowers in eastern Michigan and northern Ohio markets. Given the market's outlook for interest rates, we will continue to target our interest rate risk position at our customary relatively neutral position. Our net interest margin, however, will continue to be impacted by competitive pricing in our markets.
          The assumptions listed below form the basis for our 2008 full year earnings outlook. Growth rates when shown are based on a comparison to fourth quarter 2007 balances.
 
     With the above assumptions, earnings for 2008 are targeted for $1.57-$1.62 per common share, excluding merger costs.

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     This earnings release contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this release, the Quarterly Financial Review supplement to
 
this earnings release, or the 2007 fourth quarter earnings conference call slides, which can be found on Huntington's website at huntington-ir.com.
Significant Items
     Certain components of the Income Statement are naturally subject to more volatility than others. As a result, analysts/investors may view such items differently in their assessment of performance compared with their expectations and/or any implications resulting from them on their assessment of future performance trends. It is a general practice of analysts/investors to try and determine their perception of what "underlying" or "core" earnings performance is in any given reporting period, as this typically forms the basis for their estimation of performance in future periods.
     Therefore, Management believes the disclosure of certain "Significant Items" in current and prior period results aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance so that they can ascertain for themselves what, if any, items they may wish to include/exclude from their analysis of performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly.
     To this end, Management has adopted a practice of listing as "Significant Items" in its external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, investor presentations, Forms 10-Q and 10-K) individual and/or particularly volatile items that impact the current period results by $0.01 per share or more. . Such "Significant Items" generally fall within one of two categories: timing differences and other items.
(The one exception is the provision for credit losses discussed below)
Timing Differences
     Part of the company's regular business activities are by their nature volatile; e.g. capital markets income, gains and losses on the sale of loans, etc. While such items may generally be expected to occur within a full-year reporting period, they may vary significantly from period to period. Such items are also typically a component of an Income Statement line item and not, therefore, readily discernable. By specifically disclosing such items, analysts/investors can better assess how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance.
Other Items
     From time to time, an event or transaction might significantly impact revenues, expenses, or taxes in a particular reporting period that are judged to be one-time, short-term in nature, and/or materially outside typically expected performance. Examples would be (1) merger costs as they typically impact expenses for only a few quarters during the period of transition; e.g., restructuring charges, asset valuation adjustments, etc.; (2) changes in an accounting principle; (3) one-time tax assessments/refunds; (4) a large gain/loss on the sale of an asset; (5) outsized commercial loan net charge-offs related to fraud; etc. In addition, for the periods covered by this release, the impact of the Franklin restructuring is deemed to be a significant item due to its unusually large size and because it was acquired in the Sky Financial merger and thus it is not representative of our typical underwriting criteria. By disclosing such items, analysts/investors can better assess how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance.
Provision for Credit Losses
     While the provision for credit losses may vary significantly between periods, Management typically excludes it from the list of "Significant Items", unless in Management's view, there is a significant specific credit(s), which is causing distortion in the period.
     Provision expense is always an assumption in analyst/investor expectations of earnings and there is apparent agreement among them that provision expense is included in their definition of "underlying" or "core" earnings unlike "timing differences" or "other items". In addition, provision expense is an individual Income Statement line item so its value is easily known and, except in very rare situations, the amount in any reporting period always exceeds $0.01 per share. In addition, the factors influencing the level of provision expense receive detailed additional disclosure and analysis so that analysts/investors have information readily available to understand the underlying factors that result in the reported provision expense amount.
 
     In addition, provision expense trends usually increase/decrease in a somewhat orderly pattern in conjunction with credit quality cycle changes; i.e., as credit quality improves provision expense generally declines and vice versa. While they may have differing views regarding magnitude and/or trends in provision expense, every analyst and most investors incorporate a provision expense estimate in their financial performance estimates.
Other Exclusions
     "Significant Items" for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may significantly impact future periods. A number of factors, including those described in Huntington's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors described from time to time in Huntington's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could significantly impact future periods.
Estimating the Impact on Balance Sheet and Income Statement Results Due to Acquisitions
     The merger with Sky Financial Group Inc. (Sky Financial) was completed on July 1, 2007. At the time of acquisition, Sky Financial had assets of $16.8 billion, including $13.3 billion of loans, and core deposits of $12.0 billion. Sky Financial results were fully included in our consolidated results for the full 2007 third quarter, and will impact all quarters thereafter. As a result, performance comparisons of 2007 fourth quarter and 2007 full-year performance to comparable prior periods are affected, as Sky Financial results were not included in the prior periods. Comparisons of the 2007 fourth quarter and 2007 full-year performance compared with prior periods are impacted as follows:
     Given the significant impact of the merger on reported 2007 results, management believes that an understanding of the impacts of the merger is necessary to understand better underlying performance trends. When comparing post-merger period results to pre-merger periods, the following terms are used when discussing financial performance:
     The following methodology has been implemented to estimate the approximate effect of the Sky Financial merger used to determine "merger-related" impacts.
Balance Sheet Items
     For loans and leases, as well as core deposits, Sky Financial's balances as of June 30, 2007, adjusted for consolidating, merger, and purchase accounting adjustments, are used in the comparison. To estimate the impact on 2007 fourth quarter average balances, it was assumed that the June 30, 2007 balances, as adjusted, remained constant throughout the 2007 third quarter and will remain constant in all subsequent periods.
Income Statement Items
     For income statement line items, Sky Financial's actual results for the first six months of 2007, adjusted for the impact of unusual items and purchase accounting adjustments, were determined. This six-month adjusted amount was divided by two to estimate a quarterly amount. This results in an approximate quarterly impact as the methodology does not adjust for any unusual items or seasonal factors in Sky Financial's 2007 six-month results. Nor does it consider any revenue or expense synergies realized since the merger date. This same estimated amount will also be used in all subsequent quarterly reporting periods. The one exception to this methodology of holding
 
the estimated quarterly impact constant relates to the amortization of intangibles expense where the amount is known and is therefore used.
     Table 11 below provides detail of changes to selected reported results to quantify the impact of the Sky Financial merger using this methodology:

Annualized data
     Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are "annualized" in this presentation to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and
 
deposit growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
     Income from tax-exempt earnings assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
     Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of significant items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
NM or nm
     Percent changes of 100% or more are typically shown as "nm" or "not meaningful" unless required. Such large percent changes typically reflect the impact of unusual or particularly volatile items within the measured periods. Since the primary purpose of showing a percent change is for discerning underlying performance trends, such large percent changes are "not meaningful" for this purpose.
