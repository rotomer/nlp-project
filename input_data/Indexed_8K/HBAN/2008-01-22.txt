SECTION 1.01. ANNUAL MEETING. In 2007, the Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of the stockholders to elect directors and transact any other business within its powers at such time and on such date during the thirty-one day period beginning May 29, 2007 and ending June 28, 2007 as the Board of Directors shall determine. Commencing in 2008, the Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of its stockholders to elect directors and transact any other business within its powers, at such time and on such date during the thirty-one day period beginning March 30 and ending April 29 of each year as the Board of Directors shall determine. In the absence of a determination by the Board of Directors, commencing in 2008, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at 3:00 p.m. on the third Thursday of April in each year if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the next secular day following. At the annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect directors to the Board of Directors and may transact any other business as may be brought before the annual meeting by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder as set forth in Section 1.09 of these Bylaws.
SECTION 1.02. SPECIAL MEETING. At any time in the interval between annual meetings, a special meeting of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting or in writing (addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation), or by the Secretary of the Corporation on the written request (addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation) of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting. At a special meeting of stockholders, only such business as is set forth in the Corporation's notice of meeting shall be conducted at the meeting.
SECTION 1.03. PLACE OF MEETINGS. Meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place in the United States as is set from time to time by the Board of
Directors.
SECTION 1.04. NOTICE OF MEETINGS; WAIVER OF NOTICE. Not less than ten nor more than 90 days before each stockholders' meeting, the Secretary shall give written notice of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting and each other stockholder entitled by statute to notice of the meeting. The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and, if the meeting is a special meeting or notice of the purpose is required by statute, the purpose of the meeting. Notice is given to a stockholder when it is personally delivered to him, left at his residence or usual place of business, mailed to him at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation or transmitted to him by electronic mail to any electronic mail address of such stockholder, or by any other electronic means. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, each person
who is entitled to notice waives notice if he before or after the meeting signs a waiver of the notice which is filed with the records of stockholders' meetings, or is present at the meeting in person or by proxy. Any previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be postponed, and any special meeting of the stockholders (other than a special meeting requested by the stockholders pursuant to Section 1.02) may be cancelled, by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.
SECTION 1.05. QUORUM; VOTING. Unless statute or the Charter provides otherwise, at any meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum, and a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to approve any matter which properly comes before the meeting, except that a plurality of all votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to elect a director.
SECTION 1.06. ADJOURNMENTS. Whether or not a quorum is present, a meeting of stockholders may be adjourned from time to time by the presiding officer or by the stockholders, present in person or by proxy, by a majority vote. Any business which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified may be deferred and transacted at any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present. No further notice of an adjourned meeting other than by announcement shall be necessary if held on a date not more than 120 days after the original record date.
SECTION 1.07. GENERAL RIGHT TO VOTE; PROXIES. Unless the Charter provides for a greater or lesser number of votes per share or limits or denies voting rights, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter to be submitted at a meeting of stockholders. A stockholder may vote the stock the stockholder owns of record either in person or by proxy. A stockholder may sign a writing authorizing another person to act as proxy. Signing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the stockholder's authorized agent signing the writing or causing the stockholder's signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means, including facsimile signature. A stockholder may authorize another person to act as proxy by transmitting, or authorizing the transmission of, a telegram, cablegram, datagram, or other means of electronic or telephonic transmission to the person authorized to act as
proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or other person authorized by the person who will act as proxy to receive the transmission, in each case as the presiding officer of the meeting may determine from time to time. Unless a proxy provides otherwise, it is not valid more than 11 months after its date.
SECTION 1.08. NOMINATIONS OF PERSONS FOR ELECTION TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. No person shall be appointed, nominated or elected a director of the Corporation after having attained the age of 75 years.
Only persons nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.08 shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at such a meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.08. Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day and not later than the close of business on the 60 day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed to stockholders notice of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed to stockholders notice of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required under this Section 1.08 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for new directorships created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation; provided, further, that if the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors nominated by the Corporation to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder's notice required under this Section 1.08 shall be considered timely if notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of a postponement or an adjournment of a meeting of stockholders commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director, (a) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (b) the principal occupation or employment of such person during each of the last five years, (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such person on the date of such stockholder's notice, and (d) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor act or regulation (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice, (a) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of the stockholder and any other stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such nominees, and (b) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such stockholder on the date of such stockholder's notice and by any other stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such nominees on the date of such stockholder's notice. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may be reasonably required by the Corporation to determine the qualifications of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
th
No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.08. The chairman of the stockholders meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
SECTION 1.09. STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS. At an annual or special meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted, and only such proposals shall be acted upon, as shall have been properly brought before such meeting. To be properly brought before a meeting of stockholders, business must be (i) in the case of a special meeting, specified in the notice of the special meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) in the case of an annual meeting, otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day and not later than the close of business on the 60th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed to stockholders notice of the preceding year's annual meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of a postponement or an adjournment of a meeting of stockholders commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. To be properly brought before a meeting of stockholders, business (i) must be of a proper subject for action by stockholders under applicable law and (ii) must not, if implemented, cause the Company to violate any state, federal, or foreign law or regulation, each as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. A shareholder's notice to the Secretary, including any stockholder notice requesting a special meeting pursuant to Section 1.02, shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before a meeting of stockholders, (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business and any stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such proposal, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder on the date of such stockholder's notice
and by any other stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such proposal on the date of such stockholder's notice, and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such proposal.
Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be
conducted at a meeting of stockholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.09, except that all matters with respect to the nomination of persons for election to the Board of Directors shall be governed solely by Section 1.08. The chairman of the stockholder meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
SECTION 1.10. CONDUCT OF VOTING. At all meetings of stockholders, unless the voting is conducted by inspectors, the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions relating to the qualification of voters, the validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided, in accordance with such procedures as shall from time to time be determined by the presiding officer. If ordered by the presiding officer, the vote upon any election or question shall be taken by ballot. Unless so ordered, no vote need be by ballot.
The Board of Directors by resolution shall appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents, or representatives, to act at the meetings of stockholders and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed to act or is able to act at a
meeting of stockholders, the presiding officer shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by law.
SECTION 2.01. FUNCTION OF DIRECTORS. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of its Board of Directors. All powers of the Corporation may be exercised by or under authority of the Board of Directors, except as conferred on or reserved to the stockholders by statute or by the Charter or these Bylaws.
SECTION 2.02. NUMBER OF DIRECTORS. The Corporation shall have the number of directors provided by the Charter until changed as provided in this Section
2.02. A majority of the entire Board of Directors may alter the number of directors set by the Charter to not more than 25 nor less than three directors; provided that any such action may not affect the tenure of office of any director.
SECTION 2.03. ELECTION AND TENURE OF DIRECTORS. Beginning with the election of directors in 1987, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III. Each such class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors, and any remaining directors shall be included within such class or classes as the Board of Directors shall designate. At the annual meeting of stockholders in 1987, Class I directors shall be elected for a one-year term, Class II directors for a two-year term, and Class III directors for a three-year term. Except as provided in Section 2.04 of this Article II, at each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders beginning in 1988, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible. Any director who has attained the age of 75 years shall retire effective on the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders. A director may otherwise be removed from office for cause only and, subject to such removal, death, resignation, retirement or disqualification, shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his term expires and until
his successor shall be elected and qualify.
SECTION 2.04. VACANCY ON BOARD. The stockholders may elect a successor to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors which results from the retirement or
removal of a director. A majority of the remaining directors, whether or not sufficient to constitute a quorum, may fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors which results from any cause except an increase in the number of directors and a majority of the entire Board of Directors may fill a vacancy which results from an increase in the number of directors. Any director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the class in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies.
SECTION 2.05. REGULAR MEETINGS. After each annual meeting of stockholders at which directors shall have been elected, the Board of Directors shall meet as soon as practicable for the purpose of organization and the transaction of other business. Such first regular meeting shall be held at any place as may be designated by the Chairman, President or Board of Directors for such first regular meeting, or in default of such designation at the place of the holding of the immediately preceding meeting of stockholders. Any other regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held on such date and at any place as may be designated from time to time by the Chairman of the Board. No notice of such regular meetings shall be necessary if held as hereinabove provided.
SECTION 2.06. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President or by a
majority of the then-acting directors by vote at a meeting or in writing, or by a majority of the members of the executive committee, if one be constituted, by vote at a meeting or in writing. A special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held on such date and at any place as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. In the absence of such designation, such meeting shall be held at such place as may be designated in the call.
SECTION 2.07. NOTICE OF MEETING. Except as provided in Section 2.05, the Secretary shall give notice or cause to be given to each director of each regular and special meeting of the Board of Directors. The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting. Notice is given to a director when it is delivered personally to him, left at his residence or usual place of business, or sent by telegraph or telephone, at least 48 hours before the time of the meeting or, in the alternative, by mail to his address as it shall appear on the records of the Corporation, at least 72 hours before the time of the meeting;
provided, however, that notice of a special meeting which is called by the Chairman or the President is given to a director when it is delivered personally to him or sent by telegraph or telephone at least one hour before the time of the meeting. Unless these Bylaws or a resolution of the Board of Directors provides otherwise, the notice need not state the business to be transacted at or the purposes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors. No notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors need be given to any director who attends, or to any director who, in writing executed and filed with the records of the meeting either before or after the holding thereof, waives such notice. Any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and no notice need be given of any such adjourned meeting other than by announcement.
SECTION 2.08. ACTION BY DIRECTORS. Unless statute, the Charter or these Bylaws requires a greater proportion, the action of a majority of the directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is the action of the Board of Directors. A majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, the directors present, by majority vote and without notice other than by announcement, may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, if an unanimous written consent which sets forth the action is signed by each member of the Board of Directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors.
SECTION 2.09. MEETING BY CONFERENCE TELEPHONE. Members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participation in a meeting by these means constitutes presence in person at a meeting.
SECTION 2.10. COMPENSATION. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of the Directors. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each regular and special meeting of the Board of Directors or committees thereof. In addition, by resolution of the Board of Directors, a stated annual retainer and/or a fixed sum for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors or committees thereof, and other compensation for their services as such, may be paid to directors. A director who serves the Corporation in any other capacity also may receive compensation for such other services.
SECTION 3.01. COMMITTEES. The Board of Directors may appoint from among its members an Executive Committee and other committees composed of one or more directors and delegate to these committees any of the powers of the Board of Directors, except the power to declare dividends or other distributions on stock, elect directors, issue stock other than as provided in the next sentence, recommend to the stockholders any action which requires stockholder approval, amend these Bylaws, or approve any merger or share exchange which does not require stockholder approval. If the Board of Directors has given general authorization for the issuance of stock which provides for or establishes a method or procedure for determining the maximum number of shares to be issued, a committee of the Board of Directors, in accordance with that general authorization or any stock option or other plan or program adopted by the Board of Directors, may fix the terms of stock subject to classification or reclassification and the terms on which any stock may be issued, including all terms and conditions required or permitted to be established or authorized by the Board of Directors.
SECTION 3.02. COMMITTEE PROCEDURE. The Board of Directors shall have the power to prescribe the manner in which proceedings of each committee shall be
held. Unless the Board of Directors shall otherwise provide, the actions of each committee shall be governed by the following rules of procedure. A majority of the members of a committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of those present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the committee. The members of a committee present at any meeting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may appoint a director to act in the place of an absent member. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of a committee may be taken without a meeting, if an unanimous written consent which sets forth the action is signed by each member of the committee and filed with the minutes of the committee. The members of a committee may conduct any meeting thereof by conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participation in a meeting by these means constitutes presence in person at a meeting. In the absence of any prescription by the Board of Directors or any applicable provision of these Bylaws, each committee may prescribe the manner in which its proceedings shall be conducted.

In the absence of designation the Chairman shall serve as Chief Executive Officer. The Corporation may also have one or more Vice Presidents (which may be designated Executive Vice President, Senior Vice President or Vice President), assistant officers and such other officers as may be established by the Board of Directors. A person may hold more than one office in the Corporation but may not serve concurrently as both President and Vice President of the Corporation.

The officers shall be appointed to hold their respective offices at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors or, as to any assistant or subordinate officer, any committee or officer authorized by the Board of Directors, may remove an officer at any time. The removal of an officer does not prejudice any of his contractual rights. The Board of Directors or, as to any assistant or
subordinate officer, any committee or officer authorized by the Board of Directors, may fill a vacancy which occurs in any office.
