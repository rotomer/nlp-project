Item 8.01. Other Information.
On February 27, 2008, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated ("Huntington") made an investor presentation at the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Banking Conference in Boston, MA. This presentation was webcast.
As part of the prepared remarks, Huntington management reaffirmed its 2008 full year earnings guidance of $1.57-$1.62 per common share, excluding merger costs of $0.01-$0.02 per common share and an estimated after tax $0.04 per common share benefit of an expected Visa indemnification expense reversal. This guidance was originally disclosed in its January 17, 2008, earnings press release.
Management noted that a number of earnings drivers had changed since the January 17, 2008, disclosure. Nevertheless, the expected net impact of these changes would be immaterial, such that the original guidance remained the expectation. Items that had changed included:
Management also confirmed its 2008 full year net charge-off expectation of 0.60%-0.65% of average loans and leases, but noted that more of the expected increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses would likely occur in the first half of the year.
The presentation slides and an audio rebroadcast of the entire webcast presentation, is available on the Investor Relations section of Huntington's website at http://huntington.com. The link to this specific rebroadcast is: http://www.investquest.com/iq/h/hban/confcall/.
The information contained or incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those contained or implied by such statements for a variety of factors including: (1) deterioration in the loan portfolio could be worse than expected due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of the collateral could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected; (2) merger benefits including expense efficiencies and revenue synergies may not be fully realized and / or within expected timeframes; (3) merger disruptions may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients, associates, or suppliers; (4) changes in economic conditions; (5) movements in interest rates; (6) competitive pressures on product pricing and services; (7) success and timing of other business strategies; (8) the nature, extent, and timing of governmental actions and reforms; and (9) extended disruption of vital infrastructure. Additional risk factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Huntington's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and documents subsequently filed by Huntington with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K are based on information available at the time of the presentation on February 27, 2008. Huntington assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
 
The 2008 full year earnings guidance provided in the February 27, 2008 presentation is not presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) because it excludes merger related integration costs and an estimated after tax benefit of an expected Visa indemnification expense reversal, as Management considers these items to be unusual. Below is the guidance based upon GAAP.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
