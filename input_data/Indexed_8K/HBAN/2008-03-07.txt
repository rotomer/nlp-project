March 7, 2008
My Fellow Huntington Shareholder:
Consistent with our preliminary proxy filing with the SEC, it has been reported recently that my total 2007 compensation was $2,185,000. Because of Huntington's sub-par performance in 2007 and because of intense shareholder interest in CEO compensation in general, I want you to be informed about my compensation; the current value of the equity-based compensation is substantially less than the level we are required to report.
There are three primary components of my compensation  base salary, annual cash incentive, and equity. Here are the details of each:
In October 2007, the Compensation Committee and full Board of Directors increased my salary by 3% to $891,000 from $865,000. It is now 11.4% higher than it was when I joined Huntington in February 2001. My base compensation for full year 2007 was $870,417, up 3.4% from the 2006 level.
Base Salary
Because of Huntington's unsatisfactory financial performance in 2007, I did not deserve an annual cash incentive and did not receive one. For 2006, I was awarded $820,477.
Annual Cash Incentive
Equity Compensation
You will soon receive the proxy material which contains comprehensive information about executive compensation. But in sum, most of the compensation I ultimately receive is tied to Huntington's financial performance or the performance of our stock price. Until each improves substantially, I will not benefit significantly from either an annual cash incentive or equity compensation.
I hope this is helpful to you.
Sincerely,
/s/ Thomas E. Hoaglin
