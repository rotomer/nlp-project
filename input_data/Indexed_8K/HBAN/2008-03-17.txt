Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
In an internal communication today commenting on recent turmoil in the financial markets, Thomas E. Hoaglin, chairman, president and CEO of Huntington Bancshares noted that Huntington expects 2008 first quarter net charge-offs will be below the full-year targeted range of 0.60-0.65% of average total loans and leases, and that the Franklin Credit Management Corporation relationship continues to perform consistent with expectations and per terms of the requirements of the restructuring previously announced on January 3, 2008. Huntington noted in a Form 8-K filed February 27, 2008, that it anticipates that more of the expected increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses for 2008 would likely occur in the first half of the year.
