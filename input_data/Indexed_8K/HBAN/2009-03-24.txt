In the aggregate for the transactions, Huntington exchanged 11,715,484 shares of Huntington common stock for 53,809 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The exchanges will settle on or before March 30, 2009. The shares of Huntington common stock are being issued in reliance upon the exemption set forth in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933 for securities exchanged by the issuer and an existing se curity holder where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly by the issuer for soliciting such exchange.
     
The exchange will result in an addition to Huntington's tangible common equity (total common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets) of $53.8 million.
     
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
