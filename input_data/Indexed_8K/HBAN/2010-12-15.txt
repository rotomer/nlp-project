Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
     On December 15, 2010, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (the "Company") priced its previously announced public offering of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated debt (the "Notes Offering"). The Company intends to use the proceeds of the Notes Offering, together with proceeds of its recently priced public offering of approximately $920.0 million of common stock and other available funds, to repurchase all $1.4 billion of the Series B Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock that it issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury") under the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program's Capital Purchase Program at such time as its banking regulators authorize and the Treasury approves.
     The Notes Offering is more fully described in a prospectus supplement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on December 15, 2010, to the accompanying prospectus filed with the Commission on January 13, 2009, as part of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-156700). This filing does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any offer or sale of these securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The offering will be made only by means of a prospectus, copies of which may be obtained from Goldman, Sachs & Co. by contacting Goldman, Sachs & Co., Prospectus Department, 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282; by telephone at 1-866-471-2526; or by email at .
