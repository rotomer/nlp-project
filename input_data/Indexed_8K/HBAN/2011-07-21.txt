The information contained or incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, plan, target, goal, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar variations.
While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: (1) worsening of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of the collateral could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected; (2) changes in economic conditions; (3) movements in interest rates; (4) competitive pressures on product pricing and services; (5) success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services introduced to implement our "Fair Play" banking philosophy; (6) changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements; (7) extended disruption of vital infrastructure; (8) the final outcome of significant litigation; (9) the nature, extent, and timing of governmental actions and reforms, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as future regulations which will be adopted by the relevant regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), to implement the Act's provisions; and (10) the outcome of judicial and regulatory decisions regarding practices in the residential mortgage industry, including among other things the processes followed for foreclosing residential mortgages. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Huntington's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and documents subsequently filed by Huntington with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available at the time of the release. Huntington assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
 
Exhibit 99.3 includes certain ratios, specifically the tangible common equity ratio, and the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are included in this report because the Federal Reserve indicated that as part of their Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), a year-end 2010 Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% would be needed. Although Huntington is not one of the SCAP bank holding companies, the market has accepted this as a "de facto" standard for being adequately capitalized since 10 of the 19 bank holding companies included in SCAP were directed to increase their capital levels to meet this targeted threshold. Other companies may calculate these financial measures differently. Risk-weighted assets are calculated under regulatory capital rules applicable to us as discussed more fully on page 7 of our Form 10-K. The tangible common equity ratio, tangible assets, and Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio were calculated as follows:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Todd Beekman (614) 480-3878
Todd.Beekman@huntington.com
COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; ) reported 2011 second quarter net income of $145.9 million, up $19.5 million, or 15%, from $126.4 million in the 2011 first quarter. Earnings per common share in the current quarter were $0.16, up $0.02 per share, or 14%, from $0.14 per common share in the prior quarter. Net income in the year-ago quarter was $48.8 million, or $0.03 per common share.
www.huntington.com
For the first six months of 2011, Huntington reported net income of $272.4 million, or $0.30 per common share. This compared with net income of $88.5 million, or $0.04 per common share, for the comparable year-ago period.
 
Huntington Bancshares Incorporated today also announced that the board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $0.04 per common share. The dividend is payable October 3, 2011, to shareholders of record on September 19, 2011.
Summary Performance Discussion Compared with 2011 First Quarter
"We are pleased that second quarter results represented our sixth consecutive quarterly increase in earnings and it shows the progress we are making on a number of fronts," said Stephen D. Steinour, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "This improvement reflected the benefits from a combination of factors such as our conservative view toward addressing credit quality early in the financial downturn, the increasing contribution from strategic investments, improving customer product penetration, and aspects of our Fair Play' banking philosophy that are gaining traction every day."
"Generating an appropriate return for our shareholders is a key objective," he continued. "As such, we are very pleased that our financial strength and performance have improved to the point that enables us to raise our common stock dividend," Steinour said. "The $0.04 per share dividend on an annualized basis equates to a dividend yield of 2.5% based on yesterday's closing stock price of $6.31. Disciplined management of capital is important, with dividends being just one component. We have established a common stock dividend payout targeted range of 20%-30%, and this declared dividend falls within the middle of that range. This is especially good news for our many retail shareholders who depend on the dividend for income."
"We are also pleased that our return on average assets was 1.11% in the second quarter. This was our highest level since the first quarter of 2007. Importantly, it has now reached the lower end of our long-term target of 1.10%-1.35%. Our return on average common tangible common equity increased to 13.3%, also our highest level in several years. This is evidence that we are making very good progress on improving the overall earnings power of the Company and generating better shareholder returns."
"Nevertheless, we can, and expect to, do better," said Steinour. "Our pre-tax, pre-provision income was below our expectations. Earning assets did not expand as envisioned, which resulted in net interest income falling below expectations. Also, noninterest expense did not decline as much as anticipated."
Net income in the second quarter was $145.9 million, up $19.5 million, or 15%, from the 2011 first quarter. Drivers of the increase were a $17.7 million, or 3%, increase in fully-taxable equivalent revenue, reflecting an 8% increase in noninterest income partially offset by a slight decline in net interest income. Net income also benefited from a $13.6 million, or 28%, decline in provision for credit losses, as well as a $2.3 million, or 1%, decrease in noninterest expense.
Total noninterest income increased $18.8 million, or 8%. This reflected increases in services charges on deposit accounts and electronic banking income of $6.4 million (12%) and $2.9 million (10%), respectively, primarily due to seasonal factors. Other income increased $7.3 million (19%), reflecting higher market-related gains and capital markets income.
 
Net interest income declined $1.0 million, or less than 1%, from the 2011 first quarter. This reflected a 1% (3% annualized) decrease in average earning assets and a 2 basis point decline in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin to 3.40%. The decrease in average earning assets was driven by a combined decline of $0.5 billion, or 5% (22% annualized), in average securities, as well as a $0.2 billion decline in average loans held for sale. The negative impact of these declines was partially offset by a $0.4 billion, or 1% (5% annualized), increase in average total loans and leases. Loan growth in the automobile portfolio and commercial and industrial loan (C&I) portfolio was strong, up 18% and 8% annualized, respectively. The noncore commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio continued its planned decline. The core deposit mix continued to improve. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits and low cost interest-bearing demand deposits on a combined basis grew $0.7 billion, or at individual growth rates of 6% (26% annualized) and 4% (16% annualized), respectively.
"Our emphasis on cross sell, coupled with customers increasingly being attracted by the benefits offered through our Fair Play' banking philosophy with programs such as 24-Hour Grace on overdrafts and more recently the launch of Asterisk-Free Checking, are clearly having a very positive effect," Steinour noted. "The percent of consumer households with over four products at the end of the 2011 second quarter was 71.3%, up from 69.4% at the end of last year. And for the first half of this year, consumer checking account households grew at a 9.9% annualized rate, up from 6.8% for full year 2010."
"Net interest income, which accounted for about 61% of total revenue in the second quarter, did not grow as much as we thought it would from the first quarter level," Steinour said. "Part of the reason was lower interest rates. A decline in short-term LIBOR rates in the second quarter resulted in lower commercial loan income, without a commensurate decline in deposit and borrowing costs. While we had strong growth in lower-cost deposits, there were few alternatives to invest these funds at an attractive risk-adjusted spread. As a result, we let other higher cost deposits run off rather than retain these deposits and invest these funds in low-return investment securities. This negatively impacted current quarter income. We viewed this as a good tradeoff between generating short-term revenue and maintaining balance sheet and risk discipline. Further, during the second quarter, interest income from hedging derivatives decreased, which negatively impacted current quarter income. However, our balance sheet remains asset sensitive and is expected to benefit from any upward movement in interest rates. The net effect of all this was a level of earning assets that was over $1 billion lower than we had envisioned at the end of the first quarter."
The provision for credit losses declined $13.6 million, or 28%, from the 2011 first quarter. This reflected a 3% decline in nonaccrual loans from the end of the prior quarter. Total criticized commercial loans declined 11% during the quarter. The period end allowance for credit losses (ACL) as a percentage of total loans and leases declined to 2.84% from 3.07%. And while the ACL as a percentage of period end total nonaccrual loans (NALs) declined slightly to 181% from 185%, it remains very strong from an historical perspective. Net charge-offs were $97.5 million, or an annualized 1.01% of average total loans and leases, down 41% from $165.1 million, or 1.73%, in the 2011 first quarter.
 
To put 2011 second quarter credit quality related performance metrics into perspective:
Commenting on credit quality trends, Steinour said, "Credit quality continued its improvement. This was as expected and reflects well on the actions we took over the last two years to address credit-related issues in our loan portfolio. Even so, these performance metrics remain elevated compared with historical performance. As such, we expect to see continued declines in nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs with several credit-related performance metrics returning to more normal levels around the middle of next year."
Total noninterest expense declined $2.3 million, or 1%, reflecting an $18.2 million decline in other expense, as the 2011 first quarter included $17.0 million in additions to litigation reserves. The benefit of this decline was partially offset by increases in professional services ($6.6 million), deposit and other insurance expense ($5.9 million), outside data processing and other services ($3.6 million), and marketing costs ($3.2 million).
"We remain focused on managing expenses from two perspectives. First, we are committed to continuing to make investments in our strategic initiatives designed to grow long-term revenue. The results of investments over the last two years are positively impacting results. Second, we are always looking for ways to do business faster, more efficiently, and better for customers in order to free up resources for continued investments and improve overall operating efficiency. This is also important in an environment of increasing regulatory-related costs. Our long-term objective is an efficiency ratio in the low-to-mid 50% range. Our efficiency ratio in the 2011 second quarter was 63%. So there are opportunities ahead of us to improve our expense performance."
The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at June 30, 2011, was 9.92%, up from 9.75% at the end of the prior quarter, and the tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.22% from 7.81%. The regulatory Tier 1 and Total capital ratios were 12.14% and 14.89%, respectively, up from 12.04% and 14.85%, respectively, at March 31, 2011.
Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income Trends
One metric that management believes is useful in analyzing performance is the level of earnings adjusted to exclude provision expense, securities gains or losses, and amortization of intangibles. In addition, earnings are adjusted for items identified by management to be outside of ordinary banking activities, and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management at the time to be infrequent or short-term in nature, which management believes may distort the company's underlying performance trends
(see Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income in Basis of Presentation for a full discussion).
 
Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income
(1)
Pre-tax, pre-provision income was $242.6 million in the 2011 second quarter, up $1.6 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter.
"Primarily reflecting the lack of growth in net interest income, our 2011 second quarter pre-tax, pre-provision performance did not improve as much as expected. With the environment for revenue growth continuing to be challenging, we believe pre-tax, pre-provision earnings for the foreseeable future will more closely mirror that of the second quarter," said Steinour. "This short pause in meaningful pre-tax, pre-provision earnings growth is disappointing, but we do not believe it will be long lived. This is why we will keep making selective investments in initiatives to grow long-term revenue, remain disciplined in our loan and deposit pricing, stay focused on increasing customer product penetration, and work on continuing to improve operating efficiency."
Expectations
The lack of prospects for meaningful economic improvement, higher interest rates, and wider spreads between short-term and long-term interest rates over the remainder of this year is a challenge. Further, borrower and consumer confidence remain fragile. And while we now have clarity on the amount and timing of the pending reduction in debit card interchange fees, this nevertheless represents a reduction in fee income. All of these combined represent meaningful revenue growth headwinds.
Nevertheless, net income is expected to grow from the second quarter level throughout the rest of the year, primarily reflecting modest revenue growth and disciplined expense control.
We believe the momentum we are seeing in loan and low cost deposit growth will continue. This, coupled with a stable net interest margin, should contribute to modest growth in net interest income. Our C&I portfolio is expected to continue to show meaningful growth with much of this reflecting the positive impact from strategic initiatives to expand our commercial lending expertise into areas like specialty banking, asset based lending, and equipment financing, in addition to our long-standing continued support of small business lending. We believe period-end balances in our C&I and auto portfolios position us for continued growth in average balances for these portfolios as we head into the third quarter.
 
We anticipate our total core deposits will increase, reflecting continued growth in consumer households and business relationships. Further, we expect the shift toward lower-cost noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts will continue.
Noninterest income is expected to show modest growth in the 2011 second half. The primary driver is expected to be service charge income as the benefits from our "Fair Play" banking philosophy continue to gain momentum commensurate with consumer household growth and increased product penetration. Mortgage banking income will likely show only modest, if any, growth throughout the second half of the year. Electronic banking income in the third quarter is expected to improve from the second quarter levels, though fourth-quarter levels will decline about 50% from second quarter levels as the new interchange fee structure will be implemented October 1, 2011. We also expect to see continued growth in the earnings contribution from other key fee income activities including capital markets, treasury management services, and brokerage, reflecting the impact of our cross-sell and product penetration initiatives throughout the company as well as the positive impact from strategic initiatives.
Expense levels are expected to remain relatively stable.
Nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs are expected to continue to decline throughout the year.
We anticipate the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to approximate 35% of income before income taxes, less approximately $40.0 million of permanent tax differences over the remainder of 2011 primarily related to tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits.

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, the 2011 first quarter Quarterly Performance Discussion and Quarterly Financial Review supplements to this document, the 2011 first quarter earnings conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington's website at www.huntington-ir.com.
Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income
One non-GAAP performance metric that Management believes is useful in analyzing underlying performance trends is pre-tax, pre-provision income. This is the level of earnings adjusted to exclude the impact of:
Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
 
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.

Earnings Performance Summary
Table 1  Earnings Performance Summary
Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons
From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by Management to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by Management at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. Management believes the disclosure of "Significant Items" in current and prior period results aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance trends.
(See Significant Items under the Basis of Presentation for a full discussion.)
 
Significant Items impacting reported results for the 2011 second and first quarters and the 2010 second quarter are shown in Table 2 below:
Table 2  Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparisons
Net Interest Income, Net Interest Margin, and Average Balance Sheet
2011 Second Quarter versus 2011 First Quarter
Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $1.1 million, or less than 1%, from the 2011 first quarter. This was caused by only a 1% (3% annualized) decrease in average earning assets and a 2 basis point decline in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin to 3.40%. This disappointing decrease in average earning assets reflected a combination of factors including:
Partially offset by:
The net interest margin decreased 2 basis points, reflecting a reduction in derivatives income and lower loan yields, partially offset by the positive impacts of increases in low cost deposits and improved deposit pricing.
 
Table 3  Loans and Leases  2Q11 vs. 1Q11
Average total loans and leases increased $0.4 billion, or 1% (5% annualized), from the 2011 first quarter, reflecting:
Partially offset by:
 
Table 4  Deposits  2Q11 vs. 1Q11
Average total deposits declined $0.4 billion, or 1% (4% annualized), from the 2011 first quarter reflecting:
Partially offset by:
2011 Second Quarter versus 2010 Second Quarter
Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $5.0 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter. This reflected the benefit of a $1.4 billion, or 3%, increase in average total earning assets since the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin declined to 3.40% from 3.46%. The increase in average earning assets reflected a combination of factors including:
The 6 basis point decline in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin reflected a reduction in derivatives income, lower loan yields, and lower securities yields, partially offset by the positive impacts of increases in low cost deposits and improved deposit pricing.
 
Table 5  Loans and Leases  2Q11 vs. 2Q10
Average total loans and leases increased $1.4 billion, or 4%, from the year-ago quarter reflecting:
Partially offset by:
 
Table 6  Deposits  2Q11 vs. 2Q10
Average total deposits increased $0.9 billion, or 2%, from the year-ago quarter reflecting:
Partially offset by:
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses in the 2011 second quarter was $35.8 million, down $13.6 million, or 28%, from the prior quarter and down $157.6 million, or 81%, from the year-ago quarter. The decline in provision expense reflected a combination of lower NCOs and the reduction of Criticized loans throughout the entire loan and lease portfolio. The reduction in Criticized loans reflected the resolution of problem credits for which reserves had been previously established. The current quarter's provision for credit losses was $61.7 million less than total net charge-offs (
see Credit Quality discussion).
 
Noninterest Income
2011 Second Quarter versus 2011 First Quarter
Table 7  Noninterest Income  2Q11 vs. 1Q11
Noninterest income increased $18.8 million, or 8%, from the 2011 first quarter reflecting:
 
2011 Second Quarter versus 2010 Second Quarter

Noninterest Expense
2011 Second Quarter versus 2011 First Quarter
Table 9  Noninterest Expense  2Q11 vs. 1Q11
Noninterest expense declined $2.3 million, or 1%, from the 2011 first quarter. This was less than expected and reflected:
Partially offset by:
 
2011 Second Quarter versus 2010 Second Quarter
Table 10  Noninterest Expense  2Q11 vs. 2Q10
Noninterest expense increased $14.6 million, or 4%, from the year-ago quarter reflecting:
Partially offset by:
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes in the 2011 second quarter was $49.0 million. The effective tax rate for the 2011 second quarter was 25.1%. At June 30, 2011, we had a net deferred tax asset of $432.7 million. Based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment to the deferred tax asset at June 30, 2011. The total disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes decreased to $48.2 million at June 30, 2011 from $89.9 million at March 31, 2011.
 
We anticipate the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to approximate 35% of income before income taxes, less approximately $40.0 million of permanent tax differences over the remainder of 2011 primarily related to tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits.
Credit Quality Performance Discussion
Credit quality performance in the 2011 second quarter reflected continued improvement in the overall loan portfolio relating to net charge-off (NCO) activity, as well as some improvement in the delinquency trends. Key credit quality metrics also showed improvement, including a 5% decline in nonperforming assets (NPAs) and a 11% decline in the level of Criticized commercial loans compared to the prior quarter. The reduction in NPAs was achieved despite a more conservative policy on loans secured by residential properties implemented in the quarter. New NPA inflows increased in the quarter compared to the prior quarter due to the more conservative policy. We expect to see lower inflows in future quarters.
Net Charge-Offs (NCOs)
Table 11  Net Charge-Offs
 
Total net charge-offs for the 2011 second quarter were $97.5 million, or an annualized 1.01% of average total loans and leases. This was down $67.5 million, or 41%, from $165.1 million, or an annualized 1.73%, in the 2011 first quarter.
Total C&I net charge-offs for the 2011 second quarter were $18.7 million, or an annualized 0.56%, down 56% from $42.2 million, or an annualized 1.29% of related loans, in the prior quarter. This decline was evident across our geographic footprint and was consistent with our expectations. The current quarter's NCOs were associated with smaller relationships, consistent with the longer term run-rate expectations.
Current quarter CRE net charge-offs were $27.6 million, or an annualized 1.77% of average total CRE loans. This was down $40.1 million, or 59%, from $67.7 million, or an annualized 4.15%, in the prior quarter. This performance was consistent with our expectations and was evident across our geographic footprint. We continue to anticipate lower CRE NCOs in future quarters.
Total consumer net charge-offs in the current quarter were $51.2 million, or an annualized 1.08% of average total consumer loans, down $4.0 million, or 7%, from $55.2 million, or an annualized 1.20%, in the 2011 first quarter.
Automobile loan and lease net charge-offs were $2.3 million, or an annualized 0.15% of related average balances, down 52% from $4.7 million, or an annualized 0.33%, in the 2011 first quarter. The decline reflected lower delinquency levels during the current quarter, the continued high credit quality of originations, and a very strong resale market for used vehicles.
Home equity net charge-offs were $25.4 million, or an annualized 1.29% of related average balances, down 5% from $26.7 million, or an annualized 1.38%, in the 2011 first quarter. This performance was consistent with our expectations for the portfolio given the economic conditions in our markets. We continue to manage the default rate through focused delinquency monitoring as virtually all defaults for second-lien home equity loans incur significant losses primarily due to insufficient equity in the collateral property.
Residential mortgage net charge-offs in the current quarter were $16.5 million, or an annualized 1.44% of related loans, down 13% from $18.9 million, or an annualized 1.70%, in the prior quarter. The $2.5 million decline from the prior quarter, was due to the fact that in the 2011 first quarter we implemented a change regarding net charge-offs in our residential mortgage portfolio by accelerating the timing for when a charge-off is recognized.
 
Nonaccrual Loans (NALs) and Nonperforming Assets (NPAs)
Table 12  Nonaccrual Loans and Nonperforming Assets
Total nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) were $614.2 million at June 30, 2011, and represented 1.57% of total loans and leases. This was down $22.0 million, or 3%, from $636.3 million, or 1.66%, of total loans and leases, at March 31, 2011.
C&I NALs decreased $31.1 million, or 12%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting both NCO activity and problem credit resolutions, including payoffs. The decline was associated with loans throughout our footprint, with no specific geographic concentration. The reduction was achieved despite an increase in the level of new NALs compared to the prior quarter level. The increased level of inflows was primarily the result of one large relationship.
CRE NALs decreased $14.3 million, or 5%, from March 31, 2011, reflecting both NCO activity and problem credit resolutions, including borrower payments and payoffs. The reduction was achieved despite an increase in the level of new NALs compared to the prior quarter level. The increased level of inflows was primarily centered in three relatively large relationships, and we do not believe this increase to be an indication of a reversal of the declining trend of new NALs. We continue to be focused on early recognition of risks through our on-going portfolio management processes.
In contrast, residential mortgage and home equity NALs increased $15.0 million, or 34%, and $8.3 million, or 33%, respectively. These increases reflected a more conservative nonaccrual status policy implemented in the quarter. Prior to the 2011 second quarter, first and second mortgages were recognized as nonaccrual loans at 180 days past due. During the second quarter, nonaccrual loan recognition for first and second mortgages was changed to 150 and 120 days past due, respectively.
Nonperforming assets (NPAs), which include NALs, were $652.9 million at June 30, 2011, and represented 1.67% of related assets. This was down $37.9 million, or 5%, from $690.9 million, or 1.80%, of related assets at the end of the prior quarter. This included a reduction of $15.9 million, or 29%, in OREO, reflecting continued declines in both the commercial and residential segments. We continue to be active in the on-going management of our OREO portfolio as lower inflow levels combined with aggressive sales activities resulted in the continued declining trend in our OREO levels.
 
Table 13  90 Days Past Due and Accruing Restructured Loans
Total accruing loans and leases over 90 days past due, excluding loans guaranteed by the U.S. Government, were $57.7 million at June 30, 2011, down $15.9 million, or 22%, from the end of the prior quarter, and down $25.7 million, or 31%, from the end of the year-ago period. On this same basis, the over 90-day delinquency ratio was 0.15% at June 30, 2011, down from 0.19% at the end of the 2011 first, and down 8 basis points from a year earlier. For total consumer loans, and on this same basis, the over 90-day delinquency ratio was 0.30% at June 30, 2011, down from 0.39% at the end of the prior quarter.
Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)
We maintain two reserves, both of which are available to absorb inherent credit losses: the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC). When summed together, these reserves constitute the total ACL.
 
Table 14  Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)
At June 30, 2011, the ALLL was $1,071.1 million, down $62.1 million, or 5%, from $1,133.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. Expressed as a percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at June 30, 2011, was 2.74%, down from 2.96% at March 31, 2011. The ALLL as a percent of NALs was 174% at June 30, 2011, down slightly from 178% at March 31, 2011.
At June 30, 2011, the AULC was $41.1 million, down $1.2 million, from the end of the prior quarter.
On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases at June 30, 2011, was 2.84%, down from 3.07% at March 31, 2011. This decline reflected a reduction to the commercial-related ACL as a result of an overall reduction in the level of commercial Criticized loans and charge-offs on loans with specific reserves, partially offset by a slight increase in the consumer-related ACL as a result of loan growth. The ACL as a percent of NALs was 181% at June 30, 2011, down slightly from 185% at March 31, 2011, but still substantially higher than the 120% in the year ago quarter.
Capital
Table 15  Capital Ratios
The tangible common equity to asset ratio at June 30, 2011, was 8.22%, up 41 basis points from 7.81% at the end of the prior quarter.
 
Our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at quarter end was 9.92%, up from 9.75% at the end of the prior quarter.
At June 30, 2011, our regulatory Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios were 12.14% and 14.89%, respectively, up from 12.04% and 14.85%, respectively, at March 31, 2011.

Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Huntington's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and documents subsequently filed by Huntington with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available at the time of the release. Huntington assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, the 2011 first quarter Earnings Press Release and Quarterly Financial Review, the 2011 first quarter earnings conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington's website at www.huntington-ir.com.
Significant Items
From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by Management to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by Management at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. We refer to such items as "Significant Items". Most often, these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the company  e.g., regulatory actions/assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments/refunds, litigation actions, etc. In other cases they may result from Management decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business  e.g., merger/restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.
Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains/losses from investment activities, asset valuation writedowns, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item.
 
Management believes the disclosure of "Significant Items" in current and prior period results aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items, if any, they may wish to include/exclude from their analysis of the company's performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, Management has adopted a practice of listing "Significant Items" in its external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, quarterly performance discussions, investor presentations, Forms 10-Q and 10-K).
"Significant Items" for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. A number of items could materially impact these periods, including those described in Huntington's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors described from time to time in Huntington's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.

Notes
:
The preparation of financial statement data in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
