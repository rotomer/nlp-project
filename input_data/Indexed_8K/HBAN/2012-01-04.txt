On December 28, 2011, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), issued 35,500 shares of its Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), the terms of which are more fully described in the Articles Supplementary of the Company filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland on December 28, 2011 designating the preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock. The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have preferential dividend and liquidation rights over the holders of the Companys Junior Stock (as defined below) and on parity with the holders of the Company's Parity Stock (as defined below). Further, the Companys ability to declare or pay dividends with respect to, or to redeem, purchase or acquire any of its Junior Stock became subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock during any dividend period. "Junior Stock" means the Companys common stock and each other class or series of preferred stock the Company may issue in the future, the terms of which do not expressly provide that it ranks on a parity with or senior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Company. In addition, the Companys ability to pay dividends on any Parity Stock became subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock during any dividend period. "Parity Stock" means the Companys 8.50% Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock and each other class or series of preferred stock the Company may issue in the future the terms of which expressly provide that it will rank on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding up and dissolution of the Company. The applicable restrictions are contained in the Articles Supplementary described in the next sentence. A copy of the Articles Supplementary classifying the Series B Preferred Stock and the specimen certificate of the Series B Preferred Stock, which represents the form of certificate that will be issued to holders in the event certificates are ever issued, are attached as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 4.1, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
The Board of Directors of the Company, and a duly authorized committee thereof, by duly adopted resolutions, classified and designated 35,500 authorized but unissued shares of serial preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Serial Preferred Stock") as shares of Series B Preferred Stock, with the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock set forth in the Articles Supplementary classifying the Series B Preferred Stock. The reclassification became effective upon the acceptance for record by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland on December 28, 2011 of the Articles Supplementary classifying the Series B Preferred Stock. A copy of the Articles Supplementary filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland on December 28, 2011 and the specimen certificate of the Series B Preferred Stock, which represents the form of certificate that will be issued to holders in the event certificates are ever issued, are attached as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 4.1, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 29, 2011, the Company issued 35,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Mellon Investor Services LLC, in its role as depositary (the "Depositary"). The Depositary in turn issued 1,420,000 depositary shares representing proportionate interests of the Series B Preferred Stock ("Depositary Shares") to holders of certain series of the Companys trust preferred securities (the "Trust Preferred Securities") who participated in the Companys recently concluded exchange offer (the "Exchange Offer") of Depositary Shares for Trust Preferred Securities.

If dividends for any Dividend Payment Date are not paid in full on the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and there are issued and outstanding shares of Parity Securities with the same Dividend Payment Date, then all dividends declared on shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Securities on such date shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as full quarterly dividends per share on the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and all such Parity Securities otherwise payable on such Dividend Payment Date (subject to their having been authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Corporation out of legally available funds and including, in the case of any such Parity Securities that bear cumulative dividends, all accumulated but unpaid dividends) bear to each other.

Holders of Series B Preferred Stock will have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of Series B Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time following the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the Corporation, at its option, may redeem, all (but not less than all) of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to the sum of (i) any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends in any prior Dividend Period and (ii) any unpaid dividends for the Dividend Period in which the redemption date occurs (whether or not declared) calculated at the Dividend Rate on the basis of a full Dividend Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such Dividend Period prior to the redemption date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Dividend Period, upon notice given as provided in subsection (b) below.
(b) If shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail to the holders of record of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof (provided that, if any depositary shares representing proportional interests in the Series B Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by a holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates evidencing shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock has been duly given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Corporation for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, on and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, such shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus any declared and unpaid dividends (or in the case of a redemption following the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the redemption price plus an amount equal to the sum of (i) any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends in any prior Dividend Period and (ii) any unpaid dividends for the Dividend Period in which the redemption date occurs (whether or not declared) calculated at the Dividend Rate on the basis of a full Dividend Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such Dividend Period prior to the redemption date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Dividend Period). Any notice of redemption, once given, shall be irrevocable.
(c) In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata, by lot or in such other manner as the Corporation may determine to be equitable and permitted by the rules of any stock exchange on which the Series B Preferred Stock is listed.
Section 6. .
Liquidation Rights
(a) In the event the Corporation voluntarily or involuntarily liquidates, dissolves or winds up, the Holders at the time shall be entitled to receive liquidating distributions in the amount of $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to any authorized and declared but unpaid dividends thereon to and including the date of such liquidation, out of assets legally available for distribution to the Corporation's stockholders, before any distribution of assets is made to the holders of the Common Stock or any other Junior Securities. After payment of the full amount of such liquidating distributions, the Holders will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by, and shall have no right or claim to any remaining assets of, the Corporation.
(b) In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, are insufficient to pay in full the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on any Parity Securities, Holders and the holders of such Parity Securities shall share ratably in any distribution of assets of the Corporation in proportion to the full respective liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.
(c) The Corporation's consolidation or merger with or into any other entity, the consolidation or merger of any other entity with or into the Corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property or business will not constitute its liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
(d) In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation) on the Series B Preferred Stock, by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of shares of stock of the Corporation or otherwise, is permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be added to the Corporation's total liabilities.
Section 7. . The Series B Preferred Stock shall be perpetual.
Maturity
Section 8. . The Holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below.
Voting Rights
(a) .
Right To Elect Two Directors upon Nonpayment Events
(i) If and when the dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock or on any other class or series of the Corporation's Parity Securities that has voting rights equivalent to those of the Series B Preferred Stock, have not been authorized, declared and paid (A) in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock and Parity Securities bearing non-cumulative dividends, in full for at least six quarterly Dividend Periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), or (B) in the case of Parity Securities bearing cumulative dividends, in an aggregate amount equal to full dividends for at least six quarterly Dividend Periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors will be automatically increased by two. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock, together with the holders of all other affected classes and series of Parity Securities, voting as a single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate to the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of such class or series, will be entitled to elect the two additional members of the Board of Directors (the "" ) at any annual or special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected or any special meeting of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Securities for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided below, but only if the election of any Preferred Stock Directors would not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the NASDAQ Global Select Market (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. In addition, the Board of Directors shall at no time have more than two Preferred Stock Directors.
Preferred Stock Directors
(ii) At any time after this voting power has vested as described above, the Corporation's Secretary may, and upon the written request of holders of record of at least 20% of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Securities (addressed to the Secretary at the Corporation's principal office) must, call a special meeting of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Securities for the election of the Preferred Stock Directors. Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Bylaws for a special meeting of the stockholders, which the Corporation will provide upon request, or as required by law. If the Corporation's Secretary is required to call a meeting but does not do so within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock may (at the Corporation's expense) call such meeting upon notice as provided in this Section 8, and for that purpose will have access to the Corporation's stock books. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the Corporation's stockholders unless they have been previously terminated as described below. In case any vacancy occurs among the Preferred Stock Directors, a successor will be elected by the Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders upon the nomination by the remaining Preferred Stock Director or if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of record of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and all Parity Securities, voting as a single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate to the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of such class or series. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.
(iii) Whenever full dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on the Series B Preferred Stock and any non-cumulative Parity Securities for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods and all dividends on any cumulative Parity Securities have been paid in full, then the right of the Holders of Series B Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of these voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods), the terms of office of all Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be automatically reduced accordingly.
(b) .
Other Voting Rights
(i) So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by the Charter, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any class or series of Parity Securities with similar rights then outstanding, voting together as a single class, with each series or class having a number of votes proportionate to the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of such class or series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating:
(A) . Any amendment of the Charter to authorize, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or distribution of assets on the Corporation's liquidation; as well as any amendment of the Charter or Bylaws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely; provided that the amendment of the Charter so as to authorize or create, or to increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and in the distribution of assets on the Corporation's liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to affect adversely the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock; or
Certain Charter Amendments
(B) . Any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any entity other than a corporation (or comparable foreign entity), or any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any corporation (or comparable foreign entity) unless (i) the Corporation is the surviving corporation in such merger or consolidation and the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding or (ii) the Corporation is not the surviving entity in such merger or consolidation but the Series B Preferred Stock is not changed in such merger or consolidation into anything other than a class or series of preferred stock or similar security of the surviving or resulting entity, or the entity controlling such entity, having voting powers, preferences and special rights that, if such change were effected by amendment of the Charter, would not require a vote of the Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock under Section 8(b)(i)(A).
Certain Mergers and Consolidations
(c) Sections 8(a) and (b) shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which the vote would otherwise be required all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Corporation for the benefit of Holders of Series B Preferred Stock to effect the redemption.
(d) Except as expressly provided in this Section 8, each Holder of Series B Preferred Stock will have one vote per share on any matter in Section 8(a) and 8(b) on which Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, including any action by written consent. The Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall have exclusive voting rights on any charter amendment that would alter only the contract rights, as expressly set forth in the Charter, of the Series B Preferred Stock.
Section 9. . The duly appointed Transfer Agent, Registrar and paying agent for the Series B Preferred Stock shall initially be Mellon Investor Services LLC. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, remove the Transfer Agent, Registrar and paying agent; provided that the Corporation shall appoint a successor transfer agent who shall accept such appointment prior to the effectiveness of such removal.
Transfer Agent, Registrar and Paying Agent
Section 10. . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the Transfer Agent may deem and treat the record Holder of any share of Series B Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such Transfer Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
Record Holders
