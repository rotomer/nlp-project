COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; ) reported 2011 fourth quarter net income of $126.9 million, down $16.5 million, or 12%, from $143.4 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per common share in the current quarter were $0.14, down $0.02 from the prior quarter. Net income in the year-ago quarter was $122.9 million, or $0.05 per common share.

For the full year of 2011, Huntington reported net income of $542.6 million, or $0.59 per common share. This compared with net income of $312.3 million, or $0.19 per common share, for the comparable year-ago period.
Huntington today also announced that the board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $0.04 per common share. The dividend is payable April 2, 2012, to shareholders of record on March 19, 2012.
Summary Performance Discussion Compared with 2011 Third Quarter
"We are pleased with the quarter. By staying focused on executing our strategic plan, we are making progress in improving long-term profitability and adding to our earnings growth opportunities," said Stephen D. Steinour, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "Net interest income increased as a result of not only strong loan originations but also a higher net interest margin, reflecting our continued focus on fundamentally changing our deposit mix and driving down the overall cost of funds. These successes are a direct result of the strategic investments we have made over the last two years. We are especially pleased with the momentum in growing consumer households and commercial relationships resulting from our Fair Play' banking philosophy and Optimal Customer Relationship (OCR) sales approach. Nevertheless, our results continued to be negatively impacted by a number of challenges. These include an extended low interest rate environment, a weak economy, and continued customer uncertainty that is resulting in, among other things, the postponement of business investment decisions. In addition, we have had to absorb a number of government-mandated reductions in fee income and additional expenses related to additional regulatory requirements."
"Disciplined management of capital to improve long-term shareholder risk-adjusted returns is important," Steinour continued. "Over the course of the last several years, we have taken a significant number of actions to reduce risk. By increasing our dividend in 2011, we took the initial step to increase the amount of capital we return to the owners of the company. During the 2011 fourth quarter, in anticipation of regulatory changes under the BASEL III standards, we began to optimize our capital structure through an exchange of several existing trust preferred securities with new low cost perpetual preferred stock."
Net income in the fourth quarter was $126.9 million, $16.5 million, or 12%, lower than the prior quarter. The primary driver of the decrease was a $29.2 million, or 11%, decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by an $8.8 million, or 2%, decrease in noninterest expense, and an $8.5 million, or 2%, increase in net interest income.
Net interest income increased $8.5 million, or 2%, from the prior quarter. This reflected a $0.4 billion, or 1% (3% annualized), increase in average earning assets and a 4 basis point increase in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin to 3.38%. The increase in average earning assets was driven by a $0.2 billion, or 1% (2% annualized), increase in average loans. Loan growth was broad based and in-line with our expectations with most categories of loans growing. Automobile loans continued to have strong levels of originations throughout the quarter. However, average automobile loan balances declined, reflecting a full quarter's impact of the third quarter's $1.0 billion automobile loan securitization. On December 31, we reclassified $1.3 billion of automobile loans to loans held for sale in anticipation of completing another securitization in the first half of 2012. Growth in the average commercial and industrial
 
loans (C&I) was strong at $0.6 billion, or 4% (16% annualized). Residential mortgages also experienced growth of $0.3, or 5% (21% annualized). Average total core deposits grew $1.4 billion, or 3% (14% annualized), with the mix continuing to shift from higher cost core certificates of deposit, which declined $0.8 billion, or 11% (43% annualized), in the fourth quarter, to lower cost total demand deposits, which grew $2.0 billion, or 14% (56% annualized). Commercial noninterest bearing demand deposit growth was particularly strong again in the fourth quarter, reflecting not only new growth but also the movement of $0.6 billion of short-term deposits that were previously collateralized short-term borrowings.
"Two years ago, we moved to a customer relationship centric OCR sales process. We are now the primary bank for the vast majority of our commercial relationships and no longer just a lender. This has led to growth in fee-related activities such as treasury management and capital markets services, as well as significant growth in noninterest bearing commercial demand deposits," Steinour noted. "The percent of commercial relationships with over four products or services at the end of 2011 was 31.4%, up from 24.2% a year ago. For 2011, commercial relationships grew at an 8.4% rate, almost double the 4.9% growth in 2010."
Commenting on the net interest margin, Steinour said, "The 4 basis points linked-quarter increase in the net interest margin reflected not only the benefits from the continued shift of our deposit mix to more lower cost demand deposits, but also a company-wide focus on reducing our overall cost of funds. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our cost of interest-bearing liabilities by 12 basis points and by over 37 basis points, or more than 30%, over the course of 2011. We continue to aggressively manage our deposits and see opportunity in 2012 for further repricing of certificates of deposits and other deposits. However, earning asset yields were down 6 basis points from the prior quarter and we expect continued pressure on yields from lower reinvestment rates on the securities portfolio and a continued shift to lower risk, lower yield loans."
Total noninterest income decreased $29.2 million, or 11%. This included a $16.2 million, or 85%, decline in gain on loan sales as the prior quarter included $15.5 million of gains associated with that quarter's automobile loan securitization. In addition, the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by a $14.6 million, or 44%, decline in electronic banking income, primarily driven by a $17.3 million reduction related to implementing the lower debit card interchange fee structure mandated in the Durbin Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act'. The full impact was partially offset by fees generated by continued strong customer growth. The negative impacts to total noninterest income were partially offset by an $11.3 million, or 88%, increase in mortgage banking income driven by a $5.6 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income, as well as a $5.2 million reduction in the net mortgage servicing rights (MSR) loss. Other income included a $7.5 million increase in mezzanine investment gains that were partially offset by a $6.4 million negative impact related to an increase in the liability associated with the sale of our Visa Class B shares in 2009.
Steinour noted, "Consumer checking account households grew 10.3% in 2011; the percent of consumer checking account households with four or more products or services were 4.1% higher, from 69.4% to 73.5%; and service charges on deposit accounts are up more than 13% from a year ago. This growth confirms the competitive advantage of our Fair Play' and OCR strategies. named Huntington Bank as the Best Regional Bank in the Midwest' for 2011. Most importantly, our current customers are actively referring us business. "

Noninterest expense decreased $8.8 million, or 2%. This included the benefit of the $9.7 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt (trust preferred securities), and a $5.9 million decrease in marketing expenses. These reductions were partially offset by a $3.8 million, or 8%, increase in outside data processing and other services, primarily due to the final costs associated with the conversion to a new debit card processor, and a $3.6 million, or 16%, increase in equipment expenses, driven by accelerated depreciation associated with the planned consolidation of 29 branches in the first quarter of 2012.
Steinour said, "Expenses continued to run at levels above our long-term expectations relative to revenue. Some of our more recent strategic actions have yet to season. Our efficiency ratio in the 2011 fourth quarter was 64.0%, with our long-term objective to reduce that to the mid 50% range."
The provision for credit losses increased $1.7 million, or 4%, from the prior quarter. This reflected a smaller reduction of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) than in the prior quarter due to the continued, but slower, improvement in credit quality as we gradually migrate toward normal levels. This was partially offset by the benefit from a lower level of net charge-offs (NCO). The period end ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 2.60%, from 2.71%. However, the ACL as a percentage of period end total nonaccrual loans (NALs) remained at 187%. NCOs were $83.9 million, or an annualized 0.85% of average total loans and leases, down 7% from $90.6 million, or 0.92%, in the prior quarter.
Commenting on credit quality trends, Steinour said, "Credit quality continued its expected improvement. This reflected well on the actions taken over the last three years to address credit-related issues in our loan portfolio. Even so, many of these performance metrics remain elevated compared with historical performance. We expect to see continued declines in nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs going forward."
For 2012, we are part of the Federal Reserve's Capital Plan Review (CapPR) stress test process and made our capital plan submission earlier this month. While we can give no assurances as to the outcome or specific interactions with the regulators, we believe we have a strong capital position. The tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.30%, up from 8.22%, at the end of the prior quarter. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at December 31, 2011, was 10.00%, down from 10.17% at the end of the prior quarter and was negatively impacted by an increase in risk-weighted assets.
Expectations
"As we have done since early 2010, we will continue to execute our core strategy, making selective investments in initiatives to grow long-term profitability. We will remain disciplined in our growth and pricing of loans and deposits and are encouraged by the net interest margin expansion this quarter. We continue to expect to improve credit quality. We will stay focused on increasing customer cross-sell, and work to improve operating efficiency. While there continues to be a high level of uncertainty and volatility surrounding the economy, lately we have seen more encouraging signs," said Steinour.
Over 2012, net interest income is expected to show modest improvement from the fourth quarter level. The momentum we are seeing in total loan and low-cost deposit growth is expected to continue. Earlier in the year, those benefits are expected to be mostly offset by downward pressure on the net interest margin due to the anticipated
 
continued mix shift to lower-rate, higher quality loans and lower securities reinvestment rates given the low absolute level of interest rates and shape of the yield curve. Our C&I portfolio is expected to continue to show meaningful growth with much of this reflecting the positive impact from strategic initiatives to expand our commercial lending expertise into areas like specialty banking, asset based lending, and equipment financing, in addition to our long-standing continued support of middle market and small business lending. For automobile loans, we will continue to evaluate the use of automobile loan securitizations to limit total on-balance sheet exposure as we expect to see continued strong levels of originations. Residential mortgages and home equity loans are expected to show modest growth, with CRE likely to experience slowing declines.
We anticipate the increase in total loans to modestly outpace growth in total deposits, reflecting a heightened focus on our overall cost of funding and the continued shift towards low- and no-cost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts.
Noninterest income is expected to show a modest increase throughout 2012 from fourth quarter levels. This is primarily due to anticipated growth in new customers and increased contribution from key fee income activities including capital markets, treasury management services, and brokerage, reflecting the impact of our cross-sell and product penetration initiatives throughout the company.
We anticipate making progress on improving our expense efficiency ratio, though this will likely reflect the benefit of revenue growth as we expect expenses could increase slightly. While we will continue our focus on improving expense efficiencies throughout the company, these improvements could be offset by additional regulatory costs and expenses associated with strategic actions, such as the opening of 40 in-store branches and expenses relating to the consolidation of 29 traditional branches.
Nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs are expected to continue to decline. The level of provision for credit losses is currently in line with our long-term expectations. However, there could be some quarterly volatility given the absolute low level and the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery.
We anticipate the effective 2012 tax rate to approximate 35% of income before income taxes, less approximately $65 to $75 million of permanent tax differences primarily related to tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits.

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, the 2011 Fourth Quarter Performance Discussion and Quarterly Financial Review supplements to this document, the fourth quarter earnings conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington's website at .
www.huntington-ir.com
Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in
 
their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
Rounding
Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.

The following provides detailed earnings performance discussion that complements the summary review contained in Huntington Bancshares Incorporated's (NASDAQ: HBAN) 2011 Fourth Quarter Earnings Press Release, which can be found at:

Table 1  Earnings Performance Summary
 
Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons
From time-to-time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items we judge to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that we believe their outsized impact at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. We believe the disclosure of such "Significant Items" in current and prior period results aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance trends.
(See Significant Items under the Basis of Presentation for a full discussion.)
As shown in Table 2 below, there were two Significant Items impacting reported results for the 2011 fourth quarter and none in the third quarter of 2011 and one in the fourth quarter of 2010:
Table 2  Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparisons
 
 
 
NA  Not applicable
Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income Trends
Pre-tax, pre-provision income (PTPP) is a metric we have used to analyze underlying performance during the last three years. This is because it analyzed earnings adjusted to exclude provision expense, which during the last three years has run higher than would be the expectation during a more normal credit environment. Our PTPP definition, also excluded securities gains or losses, amortization of intangibles, as well as Significant Items ). With our credit costs now returning to more normal levels, going forward we do not intend to report a PTPP metric.

Pre-tax, pre-provision income was $227.8 million in the current quarter, down $12.8 million, or 5%, from the prior quarter. This primarily reflected a $29.2 million decline in noninterest income as the prior quarter included a $15.5 million auto loan securitization gain.
Net Interest Income, Net Interest Margin, and Average Balance Sheet
2011 Fourth Quarter versus 2011 Third Quarter
Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $8.4 million, or 2%, from the 2011 third quarter. This reflected the combination of a $0.4 billion, or 1% (3% annualized), increase in average earning assets, driven by a $0.2 billion, or 1% (2% annualized), increase in average loans, as well as a 4 basis point increase in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin to 3.38%.The primary items impacting the net interest margin increase were:

2011 Fourth Quarter versus 2010 Fourth Quarter
Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $0.5 million, or less than 1%, from the year-ago quarter. This reflected the $0.1 billion, or less than 1%, decrease in average total earning assets, partially offset by a 1 basis point increase in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin. The decrease in average earning assets reflected a combination of factors including:
 
Partially offset by:
 
The 1 basis point increase in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin reflected the positive impact of increases in low cost deposits and lower deposit pricing, partially offset by reduction in derivatives income, lower loan yields, and lower securities yields.

Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses increased $1.7 million, or 4%, from the prior quarter. This reflected a smaller reduction of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) than in the prior quarter due to the continued, but slower improvement in credit quality as we gradually migrate toward normal levels. This was partially offset by the benefit from a lower level of net charge-offs (NCO). The period end ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 2.60% from 2.71%. However, the ACL as a percentage of period end total nonaccrual loans (NALs) remained at 187%. NCOs were $83.9 million, or an annualized 0.85% of average total loans and leases, down 7% from $90.6 million, or 0.92%, in the prior quarter (.

Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes in the 2011 fourth quarter was $42.0 million. The effective tax rate for the 2011 fourth quarter was 24.9%. At December 31, 2011, we had a net deferred tax asset of $364.8 million. Based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment to the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2011. The total disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes was $39.1 million at December 31, 2011 and $19.4 million at September 30, 2011.
We anticipate the effective tax rate for 2012 to approximate 35% of income before income taxes, less approximately $65 to $75 million of permanent tax differences primarily related to tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits.
Credit Quality Performance Discussion
Credit quality performance in the 2011 fourth quarter reflected continued improvement in the overall loan portfolio relating to net charge-off activity, as well as in key credit quality metrics, including a 4% decline in nonperforming assets and a 6% decline in the level of Criticized commercial loans compared to the prior quarter.

Total net charge-offs for the 2011 fourth quarter were $83.9 million, or an annualized 0.85% of average total loans and leases. This was down $6.6 million, or 7%, from $90.6 million, or an annualized 0.92%, in the prior quarter.
 
Total C&I net charge-offs for the 2011 fourth quarter were $10.9 million, or an annualized 0.31%, down 39% from $17.9 million, or an annualized 0.52% of related loans, in the prior quarter. This decline was evident across our geographic footprint and was consistent with our portfolio composition.
Current quarter CRE net charge-offs were $28.4 million, or an annualized 1.91% of average CRE loans. This was up $3.9 million, or 16%, from $24.4 million, or an annualized 1.60%, in the prior quarter. There was no concentration in either geography or project type and the charge-offs were generally associated with small relationships. Based on asset quality trends, we anticipate lower level of CRE NCOs in future quarters.
Total consumer net charge-offs in the current quarter were $44.6 million, or an annualized 0.92% of average total consumer loans, down $3.6 million, or 7%, from $48.2 million, or an annualized 0.99%, in the prior quarter.
Automobile loan and lease net charge-offs were $4.2 million, or an annualized 0.30% of related average balances, up 10% from $3.9 million, or an annualized 0.25%, in the prior quarter and in line with seasonal expectations. These relatively low levels of net charge-offs reflected the continued high credit quality of originations and a strong resale market for used vehicles.
Residential mortgage net charge-offs in the fourth quarter were $9.7 million, or an annualized 0.77% of related loans, down 16% from $11.6 million, or an annualized 0.97%, in the prior quarter and were consistent with expectations for a continued downward trend.
Home equity net charge-offs were $23.4 million, or an annualized 1.15% of related average balances, down 11% from $26.2 million, or an annualized 1.31%, in the prior quarter and were consistent with our expectations for continued improvement.
Nonaccrual Loans (NALs) and Nonperforming Assets (NPAs)
Table 12  Nonaccrual Loans and Nonperforming Assets
 
 
 
 
Total nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) were $541.2 million at December 31, 2011, and represented 1.39% of total loans and leases. This was down $23.9 million, or 4%, from $565.0 million, or 1.45%, of total loans and leases, at the end of the prior quarter.
 
CRE NALs decreased $27.2 million, or 11%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting both NCO activity and problem credit resolutions, including borrower payments and payoffs. We continue to be focused on early recognition of risks through our ongoing portfolio management processes.
C&I NALs decreased $7.8 million, or 4%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting both NCO activity and problem credit resolutions, including payoffs. The decline was associated with loans throughout our footprint, with no specific geographic concentration.
In contrast, residential mortgage and home equity NALs increased $7.5 million, or 12%, and $3.5 million, or 10%, respectively. These increases reflected the current weak economic conditions and the continued decline of residential real estate property values. Both home equity and residential mortgage NALs have been written down to net realizable values less anticipated selling costs, which substantially limits any significant future risk of loss.
Nonperforming assets (NPAs), which include NALs, were $590.3 million at December 31, 2011, and represented 1.51% of related assets. This was down $23.7 million, or 4%, from $614.0 million, or 1.57%, of related assets at the end of the prior quarter.
Table 13  Accruing Loans 90 Days Past Due and Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
 
 
Total accruing loans and leases over 90 days past due, excluding loans guaranteed by the U.S. Government, were $73.6 million at December 31, 2011, up $12.6 million, or 21%, from the end of the prior quarter, and down $14.0 million, or 16%, from the end of the year-ago period. On this same basis, the over 90-day delinquency ratio was 0.19% at December 31, 2011, up from 0.16% at the end of the prior quarter, and down 4 basis points from a year earlier.
 
Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)
We maintain two reserves, both of which are available to absorb inherent credit losses: the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC). When summed together, these reserves constitute the total ACL.
Table 14  Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)
 
At December 31, 2011, the ALLL was $964.8 million, down $54.9 million, or 5%, from $1,019.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. Expressed as a percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at December 31, 2011, was 2.48%, down from 2.61% at September 30, 2011. The ALLL as a percent of NALs decreased to 178% at December 31, 2011, from 180% at September 30, 2011.
At December 31, 2011, the AULC was $48.5 million, up $9.7 million, or 25%, from the end of the prior quarter impacted by a single letter of credit that has been identified as Substandard.
On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases at December 31, 2011, was 2.60%, down from 2.71% at the end of the prior quarter. The reduction was primarily a result of the continued improvement in the level of Criticized loans and a reduction in the level of specific reserves, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. It is important to note that despite the decline in the ACL ratio, given the decline in NALs, the ACL as a percent of NALs was unchanged at 187%.
 
Capital
Table 15  Capital Ratios
 
(1)"Well-capitalized" regulatory threshold
The tangible common equity to asset ratio at December 31, 2011, was 8.30%. Our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at quarter end was 10.00%, down from 10.17% at the end of the prior quarter. In addition, our regulatory Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios were 12.11% and 14.77%, respectively, down from 12.37% and 15.11%, respectively, at the end of the prior quarter. These decreases primarily reflected the impact of higher period end risk-weighted assets.

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position.

Significant Items
From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by Management to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by Management at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as "Significant Items". Most often, these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the company  e.g., regulatory actions/assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments/refunds, litigation actions, etc. In other cases they may result from Management decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business  e.g., merger/restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.
Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains/losses from investment activities, asset valuation write-downs, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item.
Management believes the disclosure of "Significant Items" in current and prior period results aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items, if any, they may wish to include/exclude from their analysis of the company's performancei.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, Management has adopted a practice of listing "Significant Items" in its external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, quarterly performance discussions, investor presentations, Forms 10-Q and 10-K).
"Significant Items" for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. A number of items could materially impact these periods, including those described in Huntington's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors described from time to time in Huntington's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income
One non-GAAP performance metric that Management believes is useful in analyzing underlying performance trends is pre-tax, pre-provision income. This is the level of earnings adjusted to exclude the impact of:
 
 
 
 
 
Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
Rounding
Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.
 

Exhibit 99.3
 
Notes:
The preparation of financial statement data in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
 
 
 
These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company's capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
