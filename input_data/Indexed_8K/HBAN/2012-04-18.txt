Summary Performance Discussion Compared with 2011 Fourth Quarter
"We are very pleased with the quarter. By staying focused on executing our strategic plan, we are making steady progress in improving long-term profitability and adding to our earnings growth opportunities," said Stephen D. Steinour, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "This quarter's financial results contained two significant items. The first was a gain relating to our recently announced FDIC-assisted purchase of Fidelity Bank in Dearborn, Michigan. The other was an addition to our litigation reserves. When looking at the performance adjusted for those significant items, revenue is meaningfully higher with noninterest expense, after considering seasonal FICA and other payroll taxes, basically unchanged."
Steinour continued, "Mortgage banking and our best-in-class indirect automobile businesses are performing as expected and taking full advantage of the current market conditions. Our focus on growing consumer households and commercial relationships and improving product cross-sell continued to positively impact financial performance and demonstrates our ability to grow revenue and protect the net interest margin despite the low interest rate environment."
Net income in the first quarter was $153.3 million, an increase of $26.4 million, or 21%, over the prior quarter. The primary drivers of the increase were a $56.0 million, or 24%, increase in noninterest income and a $10.9 million, or 24%, decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $32.4 million, or 8%, increase in noninterest expense.
Net interest income increased $2.2 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter. This reflected a $0.6 billion, or 1% (5% annualized), increase in average earning assets and a 2 basis point increase in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin to 3.40%. The 2 basis points linked-quarter increase in the net interest margin reflected the benefits from the 7 basis point reduction in the cost of deposit pricing and an increase in low cost funding. However, there was a 5 basis point negative impact from the mix and yield of earning assets and other items.
The increase in average earning assets was driven by organic growth across several categories of loans. Average commercial and industrial loans (C&I) growth was strong at $0.6 billion, or 4% (17% annualized). Automobile loan origination levels remained strong throughout the quarter. However, average automobile loan balances declined 19%, reflecting the impact of the 2011 fourth quarter reclassification of automobile loans into held for sale. Another automobile loan securitization for $1.3 billion was completed on March 8, 2012. The March 30 FDIC-assisted purchase of Fidelity Bank and the March 21 purchase of a $0.4 billion portfolio of high quality municipal equipment leases had minimal impact on average balances, although combined, add $0.9 billion to end of period balances.
(see table 1 for additional details)
Average total core deposits were stable at $41.4 billion with the mix continuing to shift from higher cost core certificates of deposit, which declined $0.3 billion, or 4% (15% annualized), to lower cost total demand deposits, which grew $0.6 billion, or 4% (16% annualized). Average commercial noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $0.4 billion, or 4% (16% annualized), to $9.7 billion and, as we highlighted in second half 2011, included approximately $1.0 billion of deposits from several large relationships that are short term in nature.
 
"Net interest income increased as a result of not only strong loan originations but also a higher net interest margin. This reflected our continued focus on fundamentally changing our deposit mix to drive down the overall cost of funds. Loan growth continued to reflect the positive results of our strategic actions," Steinour noted. "C&I loans have been growing for eight consecutive quarters. This quarter, C&I growth saw the added benefit of the economic tailwinds we are beginning to experience across much of our Midwest footprint. While utilization rates were unchanged, commercial relationships grew at an 13.3% annualized rate and have grown 16.0% since the 2010 first quarter."
Total noninterest income increased $56.0 million, or 24%. This included a $23.9 million increase in gain on loan sales as the current quarter included a $23.0 million gain associated with the automobile loan securitization. In addition, the first quarter was positively impacted by a $22.3 million increase in mortgage banking income. This was driven by an $11.6 million net mortgage servicing rights (MSR) improvement and a $10.1 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income. Other income included an $11.4 million bargain purchase gain associated with the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Dearborn, Michigan-based Fidelity Bank.
Commenting on noninterest income trends, Steinour said, "The first quarter is typically our seasonally lowest quarter for several noninterest income items. The completion of our second automobile loan securitization in the last six months and the low absolute level of interest rates and shape of the yield curve, which enabled many homeowners to refinance their mortgages at near record low rates, positively impacted results."
"Consumer checking account households grew at a 14.2% annualized rate during the quarter and were up 11.7% compared to a year ago. The percent of consumer checking account households with four or more products or services was 1.6 percentage points higher, up from 73.5% last quarter to 75.1%. The percent of commercial relationships with four or more products or services at the end of quarter was 32.7%, up from 31.4% in the prior quarter. These growth and cross-sell rates are why service charges on deposits increased 11% from a year ago and why electronic banking is only down $10.2 million over a similar timeframe. We have already made up 20% of the electronic banking revenue lost due to the Durbin amendment. These financial results point to the competitive advantage we are building through our "Fair Play" consumer strategy that is built on simply doing the right thing for our customers."
Noninterest expense increased $32.4 million, or 8%. This reflected a $23.5 million addition to litigation reserves in other expense and the prior quarter's inclusion of a $9.7 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt (trust preferred securities). Personnel costs increased $15.4 million, or 7%, most notably impacted by approximately $9 million of costs related to the annual payroll taxes resets and other benefit expense. Additionally, commissions and incentive compensation expense increased due to improved performance metrics and results. These negative impacts were partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease in outside data processing and other services, as the fourth quarter contained $5.0 million of expenses associated with the conversion to a new debit card processor.
 
Steinour said, "Noninterest expense continued to run at levels above our long-term expectations relative to revenue. Some of our more recent strategic actions have yet to season while other recent actions have resulted in clear cost reductions. For example, this quarter's sizable decline in outside data processing and other services was primarily due to the completion of the conversion to our new debit card processor."
The provision for credit losses decreased $10.9 million, or 24%, from the prior quarter. This reflected a larger reduction of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) than in the prior quarter due to the continued improvement in credit quality as we gradually migrate toward normal levels. The period end ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 2.37%, from 2.60%. However, the ACL as a percentage of period end total nonaccrual loans (NALs) increased 9 percentage points to 206% as NALs declined 14% to $467.6 million, or 1.15% of total loans. Total net charge-offs (NCO) for the 2012 first quarter were $83.0 million, or an annualized 0.85% of average total loans and leases. This was down $0.9 million, or 1%, from $83.9 million, or an annualized 0.85%, in the prior quarter.
Commenting on credit quality trends, Steinour said, "The continued improvement in credit quality performance reflected the positive results of the actions taken over the last three years to address credit-related issues in our loan portfolio. Many of our credit quality performance metrics remain elevated compared with long-term historical levels and we expect continued improvement."
Capital levels continued to be strong. Our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at March 31, 2012, was 10.15%, up from 10.00% at December 31, 2011, with our tangible common equity ratio increasing to 9.86% from 9.75% over this same period. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio at March 31, 2012, was 12.22% up from 12.11%, at year end, while our Total risk based capital ratio declined slightly to 14.76% from 14.77%. This decline reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets due to balance sheet growth.
"As announced March 14, we are pleased that the Federal Reserve completed its review of our January capital plan submission and did not object to our proposed capital actions," said Steinour. "This allows us to maintain our common dividend through the first quarter of 2013. It also gives us the potential to repurchase up to $182 million of common stock. Reinvesting excess capital to grow the business organically remains our first priority. Importantly, through dividends and now share repurchases, we have the flexibility, subject to market conditions, to return a meaningful amount of our earnings to the owners of the company."
Table 1  FDIC-Assisted Fidelity Bank Acquisition
The following table summarizes the 2012 first quarter balance sheet impact of the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Fidelity Bank completed on March 30, 2012. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. All acquired loans accrue interest as performing loans or as purchased impaired loans; therefore, none of the acquired loans were reported as nonaccrual.
 
Expectations
"Some of the encouraging signs seen late last year continued to build throughout the quarter and drove modest economic growth. Parts of the Midwest region are recovering faster than the broader United States with lower levels of unemployment, resurgence in manufacturing, and budget surpluses for several states for the first time in years. While our footprint has clearly benefitted from this recovery, the US and global economies continue to experience elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty. This requires that we remain cautious," said Steinour.
"As we have done since early 2010, we will continue to execute our core strategy, making selective investments in initiatives to grow long-term profitability. We will remain disciplined in our growth, including the pricing of loans and deposits, and we are encouraged by the net interest margin expansion this quarter. We continue to expect credit quality improvement. We will stay focused on increasing customer cross-sell and work to improve operating efficiency. We also have 18,000 new Fidelity Bank customers, giving us a great opportunity to introduce them to our products and services."
For the remainder of 2012, net interest income is expected to be modestly higher than the first quarter level. The momentum we are seeing in total loan and low-cost deposit growth is expected to continue. Those benefits to net interest income growth are expected to be mostly offset, however, by downward pressure on the net interest margin later in the year due to the anticipated continued mix shift to lower-rate, higher quality loans and lower securities reinvestment rates given the low absolute level of interest rates and shape of the yield curve. The C&I portfolio is expected to continue to show meaningful growth as our sales pipeline remains robust with much of this reflecting the positive impact from strategic initiatives to expand our commercial lending expertise into areas like specialty banking, asset based lending, and equipment financing. It also reflects our long-standing continued support of middle market and small business lending. For automobile loans, we will continue to evaluate another automobile loan securitization in the second half of the year. Such securitizations allow us to continue to expand this business while generating strong levels of originations that would otherwise limit on-balance sheet automobile loan concentration. Residential mortgages and home equity loans are expected to show modest growth. CRE loans will likely continue to experience low levels of declines from current levels as the runoff in the noncore portion of the portfolio is partially offset by new core originations.
Excluding potential future automobile loan securitizations, we anticipate the increase in total loans to modestly outpace growth in total deposits. This reflects our heightened focus on our overall cost of funding and the continued shift towards low- and no-cost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts.
 
Noninterest income is expected to show a modest increase from the 2012 first quarter level after excluding the impacts of the automobile loan securitization gain, the Fidelity Bank related bargain purchase gain, and any net MSR impact. This growth is expected to primarily reflect anticipated growth in new customers and increased contribution from key fee income activities including capital markets, treasury management services, and brokerage, as well as the continued positive impact of our cross-sell and product penetration initiatives throughout the company.
For the full year, we anticipate positive operating leverage and modest improvement in our expense efficiency ratio. This will likely reflect the benefit of revenue growth as we expect expenses could increase slightly. While we will continue our focus on improving expense efficiencies throughout the company, additional regulatory costs and expenses associated with strategic actions, including the planned opening of over 40 in-store branches and integration of Fidelity Bank, may offset such improvements.
Credit quality is expected to experience continued improvement. The level of provision for credit losses is currently at the low end of our long-term expectation, and we expect some quarterly volatility given the absolute low level and the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery.
We anticipate the effective tax rate for 2012 to approximate 24%-26%, which includes permanent tax differences primarily related to tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits.

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, the 2012 First Quarter Performance Discussion and Quarterly Financial Review supplements to this document, the fourth quarter earnings conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington's website at .
www.huntington-ir.com
Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
Rounding
Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.

Table 1  Earnings Performance Summary
 
Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons
From time-to-time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items we judge to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that we believe their outsized impact at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We believe the disclosure of such "Significant Items" in current and prior period results aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance trends.
(See Significant Items under the Basis of Presentation for a full discussion.)
Table 2 highlights the Significant Items impacting reported results for the current, prior, and year-ago quarters:
Table 2  Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparisons
 
 
Net Interest Income, Net Interest Margin, and Average Balance Sheet
2012 First Quarter versus 2011 Fourth Quarter
Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $2.6 million, or 1%, from the 2011 fourth quarter. This reflected the combined benefits of a $0.6 billion, or 1% (5% annualized), increase in average earning assets and 2 basis point increase in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin to 3.40%. While average earnings assets increased, average total loans and leases declined $0.4 billion, or 1% (4% annualized), reflecting the reclassification of automobile loans to loans held for sale related to the securitization and sale of $1.3 billion of auto loans in the 2012 first quarter. The primary item impacting the increase in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin was:
 
Partially offset by:
 
 
 
Table 3  Loans and Leases  1Q12 vs. 4Q11
 
Average total loans and leases decreased $0.4 billion, or 1% (4% annualized), from the 2011 fourth quarter, primarily reflecting:

Partially offset by:
 
2012 First Quarter versus 2011 First Quarter
Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $12.9 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter. This reflected a $1.4 billion, or 3%, increase in average total earning assets, partially offset by a 2 basis point decrease in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin. The increase in average earning assets reflected a combination of factors including:
 
 
 
Partially offset by:
 
The 2 basis point decrease in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin reflected the reduction in derivatives income, lower loan yields, and lower securities yields, partially offset by the positive impact of increases in low cost deposits and lower deposit pricing.

Partially offset by:
 
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses decreased $10.9 million, or 24%, from the prior quarter, reflecting the lower provision for unfunded commitments and a lower level of net charge-offs (NCO). The period end ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 2.37% from 2.60%. However, the ACL as a percentage of period end total nonaccrual loans (NALs) increased to 206% from 187%. NCOs were $83.0 million, down 1% from $83.9 million in the prior quarter. NCOs were an annualized 0.85% in both the current and 2011 fourth quarters .

Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes in the 2012 first quarter was $52.2 million, compared to $42.0 million in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2012 first quarter was 25.4%. At March 31, 2012, we had a net deferred tax asset of $302.4 million. Based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment to the deferred tax asset at March 31, 2012. As of March 31, 2012, there was no disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes, compared to $39.1 million at December 31, 2011.
We anticipate the effective tax rate for 2012 to approximate 24%-26% which includes permanent tax differences primarily related to tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits.
 
Credit Quality Performance Discussion
Credit quality performance in the 2012 first quarter reflected continued improvement in the overall loan portfolio relating to net charge-off activity, as well as in key credit quality metrics, including an 11% decline in nonperforming assets and an 8% decline in the level of Criticized commercial loans, excluding Fidelity Bank related loans compared to the prior quarter.
Net Charge-Offs (NCOs)
Table 11  Net Charge-Offs
 
Total net charge-offs (NCO) for the 2012 first quarter were $83.0 million, or an annualized 0.85% of average total loans and leases. This was down $0.9 million, or 1%, from $83.9 million, or an annualized 0.85%, in the prior quarter.
Total C&I NCOs for the 2012 first quarter were $28.5 million, or an annualized 0.77%, up 161% from last quarter's historically low level of $10.9 million, or an annualized 0.31% of related loans. This quarter's NCOs were generally associated with smaller relationships.
Current quarter CRE net charge-offs were $10.5 million, or an annualized 0.72% of average CRE loans. This was down $17.9 million, or 63%, from $28.4 million, or an annualized 1.91%, in the prior quarter. There was no concentration in either geography or project type, and the charge-offs were generally associated with small relationships.
Automobile loan and lease net charge-offs were $3.1 million, or an annualized 0.27% of related average balances, down 27% from $4.2 million, or an annualized 0.30%. These relatively low levels of net charge-offs reflected the continued high credit quality of originations and a strong resale market for used vehicles.
 
Residential mortgage net charge-offs in the first quarter were $10.6 million, or an annualized 0.82% of related loans, up 9% from $9.7 million, or an annualized 0.77%, in the prior quarter, reflecting the continued stress in the residential real estate market.
Home equity net charge-offs were $23.7 million, or an annualized 1.15% of related average balances, up less than 1% from $23.4 million, or an annualized 1.15%, in the prior quarter.
Nonaccrual Loans (NALs) and Nonperforming Assets (NPAs)
Table 12  Nonaccrual Loans and Nonperforming Assets
 
 
Total nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) were $467.6 million at March 31, 2012 and represented 1.15% of total loans and leases. This was down $73.5 million, or 14%, from $541.1 million, or 1.39%, of total loans and leases, at the end of the prior quarter.
C&I NALs decreased $59.4 million, or 29%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting both NCO activity and problem credit resolutions, including payoffs. The decline was associated with loans throughout our footprint, with no specific industry concentration.
CRE NALs decreased $24.8 million, or 11%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting both NCO activity and problem credit resolutions, including borrower payments and payoffs. This activity represents the continuation of an improving trend evident over the past several quarters. We continue to focus on early recognition of risks and targeted actions through our on-going portfolio management processes.
In contrast, residential mortgage NALs increased $5.5 million, or 8%. This increase reflected the current economic conditions and the decline of residential real estate property values. The NAL balances have been written down to net realizable value, less anticipated selling costs, which substantially limits any significant future risk of additional loss on these loans
 
Home equity NALs increased $5.2 million, or 13%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting our implementation of regulatory guidance issued in the 2012 first quarter. This quarter, we began reporting performing junior liens that are subordinate to nonaccrual senior liens as nonaccrual loans. The impact in 2012 first quarter was an increase of $8.7 million.
Total other real estate owned increased $10.3 million, or 27%, to $48.7 million and included $8.0 million related to the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Fidelity Bank completed on March 30, 2012.
Nonperforming assets (NPAs), which include NALs, were $527.1 million at March 31, 2012, and represented 1.29% of related assets. This was down $63.2 million, or 11%, from $590.3 million, or 1.51%, of related assets at the end of the prior quarter.
Table 13  Accruing Loans 90 Days Past Due and Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
 
 
Total accruing loans and leases over 90 days past due, excluding loans guaranteed by the U.S. Government, were $60.6 million at March 31, 2012, down $13.1 million, or 18%, from the end of the prior quarter, and down $13.0 million, or 18%, from the end of the year-ago period. On this same basis, the over 90-day delinquency ratio was 0.15% at March 31, 2012, down 0.04% at the end of the prior quarter, and down 0.04% from a year earlier.
 
Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
We maintain two reserves, both of which are available to absorb inherent credit losses: the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC). When summed together, these reserves constitute the total ACL.
Table 14  Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
 
At March 31, 2012, the ALLL was $913.1 million, down $51.8 million, or 5%, from $964.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Expressed as a percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at March 31, 2012, was 2.24%, down from 2.48% at December 31, 2011. The ALLL as a percent of NALs increased to 195% at March 31, 2012, from 178% at December 31, 2011.
At March 31, 2012, the AULC was $50.9 million, up $2.5 million, or 5%, from the end of the prior quarter.
On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases at March 31, 2012, was 2.37%, down from 2.60% at the end of the prior quarter. Huntington increased the ACL allocated to the residential secured portfolios in the quarter. The increase was consistent with the regulatory guidance issued in the 2012 first quarter and our belief that credit losses for the residential secured portfolios will remain at elevated levels in the near future. The ACL at the end of the 2012 first quarter as a percent of NALs increased to 206% from 187% at the end of last year.
 
Capital
Table 15  Capital Ratios
 
The tangible common equity to asset ratio at March 31, 2011 was 8.33%, up 3 basis points from the prior quarter. Our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at quarter end was 10.15%, up from 10.00% at the end of the prior quarter. In addition, our regulatory Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.22%, up from 12.11% at the end of the prior quarter, while our Total risk-based capital ratio was 14.76%, down slightly from 14.77% at the end of last year.

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position.

Significant Items
From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by Management to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by Management at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as "Significant Items". Most often, these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the companye.g., regulatory actions/assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments/refunds, litigation actions, etc. In other cases they may result from Management decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of businesse.g., merger/restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.
Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains/losses from investment activities, asset valuation write-downs, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item.
Management believes the disclosure of "Significant Items" in current and prior period results aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items, if any, they may wish to include/exclude from their analysis of the company's performancei.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, Management has adopted a practice of listing "Significant Items" in its external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, quarterly performance discussions, investor presentations, Forms 10-Q and 10-K).
"Significant Items" for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. A number of items could materially impact these periods, including those described in Huntington's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors described from time to time in Huntington's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
 
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
Rounding
Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.
 

Exhibit 99.3
 
Notes:
The preparation of financial statement data in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
 
 
 
These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company's capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
