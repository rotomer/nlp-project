Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On April 19, 2012, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Huntington), Huntington's shareholders approved the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan"). The 2012 Plan provides for grants of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock, long-term performance awards and other stock-based awards. The board of directors approved the 2012 Plan subject to shareholder approval. Shareholder approval was obtained in order to comply with the applicable requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. and to qualify certain awards made to certain officers as deductible for federal income tax purposes under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). Shareholder approval is also necessary under the federal income tax rules with respect to the qualification of incentive stock options. Additional details about the 2012 Plan are set forth in Huntington's definitive Proxy Statement dated on March 5, 2012.
