Summary Performance Discussion
"We are very pleased with the quarter. This quarter's financial results reflect relatively stable returns and net interest margin, improving efficiency and credit metrics, and strong growth of loans, deposits, and customer relationships demonstrating the continued benefits from successfully executing our strategic plan," said Stephen D. Steinour, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "At the plan's core remains a differentiated approach to banking, coupled with investing in products and services that are driving an improvement in the stability of our long-term profitability while introducing opportunities for growth."
Steinour continued, "This was a very straight forward quarter. We completed the systems conversion and integration of Fidelity Bank, all the while remaining focused on growing the core. Our mortgage banking and best-in-class indirect automobile businesses performed as expected and benefited from current market conditions. Our focus on growing consumer households and commercial relationships and improving product cross-sell continued to positively impact financial performance. Our results demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income and support the net interest margin."
Net income in the second quarter was $152.7 million, down $0.6 million, or less than 1%, from $153.3 million in the prior quarter. The primary drivers of the decrease were a $31.5 million, or 11%, decrease in noninterest income partially offset by an $18.4 million, or 4%, decrease in noninterest expense and an $11.8 million, or 3%, increase in net interest income. The prior quarter included several significant items that elevated both noninterest income and noninterest expense. Specifically, noninterest income included a $23.0 million automobile loan securitization gain and an $11.4 million bargain purchase gain from the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Fidelity Bank. The prior quarter's noninterest expense included a $23.5 million increase to litigation reserves.
, from the prior quarter. This reflected a $1.3 billion, or 3% (10% annualized), increase in average earning assets and a 2 basis point increase in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin (NIM) to 3.42%. The linked-quarter increase in the NIM reflected the benefit of a 5 basis point reduction in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities, as well as $0.8 billion, or 7%, growth in average noninterest bearing deposits. However, there was a 3 basis point negative impact from the mix and yield of earning assets and other items.
Net interest income increased $11.8 million, or 3%
The acquisition of Fidelity Bank at the end of the prior quarter had a positive 2 basis point impact on the NIM, and the recent redemptions of two issuances of trust preferred securities had a 1 basis point positive impact.
The increase in average earning assets was driven by organic growth across several categories of loans, in addition to two transactions that occurred late in the prior quarter: (1) the FDIC-assisted Fidelity Bank acquisition, and (2) the purchase of a high quality municipal equipment lease portfolio. Average commercial and industrial loan (C&I) growth was very strong at $1.3 billion, or 9% (34% annualized), reflecting the continued elevated level of activity from multiple business lines including middle market and equipment finance, as well as the purchase of a $0.4 billion equipment lease portfolio and $0.1 billion of C&I loans associated with Fidelity Bank. Automobile loan origination levels remained strong throughout the quarter and, as we did in the 2011 fourth quarter, we reclassified $1.3 billion of automobile loans into held for sale at the end of the quarter in preparation for an expected securitization in the second half of 2012.
 
Average total core deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 3% (13% annualized), reflecting growth in all deposit categories including $0.7 billion of deposits associated with Fidelity Bank. Total average demand deposits grew $1.1 billion, or 6% (26% annualized), to $18.0 billion, and represented 40% of total deposits. Total average demand deposits in the year-ago quarter were $13.4 billion and represented 32% of total deposits. This meaningful improvement reflected our continued focus on fundamentally changing our deposit mix to drive down the overall cost of funds and support the NIM. As previously disclosed, there remains over $1.0 billion of demand deposits from several larger relationships that we consider shorter term in nature.
, from the prior quarter. This included a $22.6 million decrease in gain on sale of loans as the prior quarter included a $23.0 million gain associated with that quarter's automobile loan securitization. In addition, other income decreased $9.2 million as the prior quarter included an $11.4 million bargain purchase gain associated with the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Fidelity Bank. Mortgage banking income declined $8.1 million as the benefit of net mortgage servicing rights (MSR) decreased by $6.8 million.
%
Total noninterest income decreased $31.5 million, or 11
Commenting on revenue trends, Steinour said, "The second quarter results clearly showed the benefit of 11.6% annualized growth in consumer checking account households and 11.9% annualized growth in commercial relationships, with both electronic banking and service charges on deposits up over 9%. Not only are we gaining customers, we are selling deeper with 76.0% of consumer checking account households and 32.6% commercial relationships now with 4 or more products or services. A portion of our strategic investments remains in the early stages, such as our in-store strategy. In contrast, others have matured and are adding meaningfully to the bottom line, like our customer focused capital markets activities, which posted a record quarter resulting in 35% linked quarter and 58% year-over-year growth."
, from the prior quarter. This reflected a $19.9 million reduction in other expense as the prior quarter included a $23.5 million addition to litigation reserves. Deposit and other insurance expense decreased $5.0 million, and net occupancy declined $3.6 million. The positive impacts from these reductions were partially offset by a $6.1 million increase in outside data processing and other services, a $4.6 million seasonal increase in marketing, and a $4.2 million increase in professional services. Of the total noninterest expense increase, $6.8 million related to the prior quarter's FDIC-assisted acquisition of Fidelity Bank, of which approximately 40% was one-time in nature and mainly impacted outside data processing and other services and professional services. Of note, noninterest expense included four unrelated items, including the $2.6 million of gain on early extinguishment of debt, that we believe were one-time in nature that, in total, reduced expenses $6.4 million.
Noninterest expense decreased $18.4 million, or 4%
, from the prior quarter. This reflected a $1.3 million, or 2%, increase in net charge-offs (NCOs) to $84.2 million, or an annualized 0.82% of average total loans and leases, from $83.0 million, or an annualized 0.85%, in the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses in the current quarter was $47.7 million lower than NCOs, reflecting a continued improvement in credit quality.
The provision for credit losses increased $2.1 million, or 6%
 
The period-end allowance for credit losses (ACL) as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 2.28%, from 2.37%, reflecting the inclusion of the fair value loans related to Fidelity Bank, which have no associated ACL. The ACL as a percentage of period-end total nonaccrual loans (NALs) decreased 14 percentage points to 192% as NALs increased $6.6 million, or 1%, to $474.2 million, or 1.19% of total loans and leases.
. Our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at June 30, 2012, was 10.08%, down from 10.15% at March 31, 2012, and our tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.41% from 8.33% over this same period. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio at June 30, 2012 was 11.93%, down from 12.22%, at March 31, 2012. This decline reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets due to balance sheet growth and the capital actions taken throughout the quarter, which are discussed below.
Capital
Over the quarter, and consistent with planned capital actions, $80 million of trust preferred securities were redeemed and 6.4 million common shares were repurchased at an average price of $6.26 per share. Commenting on capital, Steinour said, "Reinvesting excess capital to grow the business organically remains our first priority. Importantly, through dividends and share repurchases, we have the flexibility, subject to market conditions, to return a meaningful amount of our earnings to the owners of the company."
Expectations
"We continue to see positive trends within our Midwest footprint. Relative to the broader United States, parts of the Midwest continue to experience lower levels of unemployment, strength in manufacturing, and more stable home prices. While our footprint has clearly benefitted from this modest recovery, the US and global economies continue to experience elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty. This requires that we remain cautious," said Steinour. "We will remain disciplined in our growth, including the pricing of loans and deposits. We continue to expect credit quality improvement. We will stay focused on increasing customer cross-sell and work to improve operating efficiency. We have completed the Fidelity Bank systems conversion and integration and have achieved the targeted expense reductions. We are now focusing on the opportunities to introduce additional products and services across our expanded customer base."
For the remainder of 2012, average net interest income is expected to show modest improvement from the second quarter level as we anticipate an increase in total loans, excluding the impacts of any future loan securitizations. Those benefits to net interest income are expected to be mostly offset, however, by downward NIM pressure due to the anticipated competitive pressures on loan pricing, as well as lower rate securities through reinvestment, and declining positive impacts from deposit repricing. The C&I portfolio is expected to continue to show meaningful growth. Our sales pipeline remains robust with much of this reflecting the positive impact from strategic initiatives to expand our commercial lending expertise into areas such as specialty banking, asset based lending, and equipment financing. It also reflects our long-standing, continued support of middle market and small business lending. Automobile loan balances are expected to grow from period-end balances. Residential mortgages and home equity loans are expected to be relatively flat as we continue to evaluate the impact of the proposed capital rules recently released by our regulators. CRE loans likely will experience low levels of declines from current levels.
 
Excluding potential future automobile loan securitizations, we anticipate the increase in total loans will modestly outpace growth in total deposits. This reflects our heightened focus on our overall cost of funding and the continued shift towards low- and no-cost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts.
Noninterest income is expected to show a modest increase from the 2012 second quarter level after excluding the impact of any future automobile loan securitization gains and any net MSR impact. This growth is expected to reflect primarily the continued growth in new customers and increased contribution from key fee income activities including capital markets, treasury management services, and brokerage, as well as the continued positive impact of our cross-sell and product penetration initiatives throughout the company.
Noninterest expense continued to run at levels above our long-term expectations relative to revenue. For the full year, we continue to anticipate positive operating leverage and modest improvement in our expense efficiency ratio. This will likely reflect the benefit of revenue growth as we expect expenses could increase slightly. While we will continue our focus on improving expense efficiencies throughout the company, additional regulatory costs and expenses associated with strategic actions, including the planned opening of over 30 in-store branches, may offset some of the improvements.
Credit quality is expected to experience continued improvement. The level of provision for credit losses in the first half of the year was at the low end of our long-term expectation, and we expect some quarterly volatility given the absolute low level of the provision for credit losses and the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery.
We anticipate the effective tax rate for 2012 to approximate 24% to 26%, which includes permanent tax benefits primarily related to tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits.

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, the 2012 Second Quarter Performance Discussion and Quarterly Financial Review supplements to this document, the second quarter earnings conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington's website at
www.huntington-ir.com.
Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
Rounding
Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.

The following provides detailed earnings performance discussion that complements the summary review contained in Huntington Bancshares Incorporated's (NASDAQ: HBAN) 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Press Release, which can be found at:
http://www.investquest.com/iq/h/hban/ne/news/
Table 1  Earnings Performance Summary
 
Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons
From time-to-time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items we judge to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that we believe their outsized impact at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We believe the disclosure of such "Significant Items", when appropriate, aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance trends.
(See Significant Items under the Basis of Presentation for a full discussion.)
Table 2 highlights the Significant Items impacting reported results for the prior quarter, as there were no significant items in the current and year ago quarters:
Table 2  Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparisons
 
 
Net Interest Income, Net Interest Margin, and Average Balance Sheet
2012 Second Quarter versus 2012 First Quarter
Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $13.6 million, or 3%, from the 2012 first quarter. This reflected the combined benefits of a $1.3 billion, or 3% (10% annualized), increase in average earning assets and a 2 basis point increase in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin (NIM) to 3.42%. The increase in average earnings assets reflected a $2.0 billion, or 5% (21% annualized), increase in average total loans and leases, partially offset by a $0.8 billion decline in average loans held for sale, reflecting last quarter's $1.3 billion automobile loan securitization and sale. The primary item impacting the increase in the NIM was:
 
Partially offset by:
 
The acquisition of Fidelity Bank at the end of the prior quarter had a positive 2 basis point impact on the NIM, and the recent redemptions of two issuances of trust preferred securities had a 1 basis point positive impact.
 
Table 3  Loans and Leases  2Q12 vs. 1Q12

The provision for credit losses increased $2.1 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter. The period end allowance for credit losses (ACL) as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 2.28% from 2.37%, with the ACL as a percentage of period end total nonaccrual loans (NALs) declining to 192% from 206%. Net charge-offs (NCO) were $84.2 million, up 2% from $83.0 million in the prior quarter. However, NCOs were an annualized 0.82% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, down from 0.85% in the 2012 first quarter .

Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes in the 2012 second quarter was $49.3 million. This compared with a provision for income taxes of $52.2 million in the 2012 first quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2012 second and first quarter were 24.4% and 25.4%, respectively. At June 30, 2012, we had a net deferred tax asset of $232.4 million. Based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment to the deferred tax asset at June 30, 2012. As of June 30, 2012 and March 31, 2012, there was no disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes.
We anticipate the effective tax rate for 2012 to approximate 24% to 26% which includes permanent tax benefits primarily related to tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits.
Credit Quality Performance Discussion
Credit quality performance in the 2012 second quarter reflected continued improvement despite the inclusion of the FDIC-assisted Fidelity Bank portfolio. Net charge-offs (NCOs) increased slightly compared to the prior quarter. While the dollar amount of NCOs was essentially unchanged, the composition shifted within the commercial portfolio from C&I to CRE. Given the relatively low absolute level of losses, volatility of this type is to be expected. NPAs declined 1% compared to the prior quarter. Although commercial Criticized loans increased compared to the prior quarter as a result of the Fidelity acquisition, the overall portfolio excluding the acquired Fidelity loans continued to improve. Several period end metrics were also impacted by the reclassification of $1.3 billion of automobile loans to loans held for sale in anticipation of another securitization and sale in the second half of 2012.
Net Charge-Offs (NCOs)
Table 11  Net Charge-Offs
 
Total NCOs for the 2012 second quarter were $84.2 million, or an annualized 0.82% of average total loans and leases. This was up $1.3 million, or 2%, from $83.0 million, or an annualized 0.85%, in the prior quarter.
 
Total C&I NCOs for the 2012 second quarter were $15.7 million, or an annualized 0.39%, down 55% from $28.5 million, or an annualized 0.77% of related loans in the prior quarter. As with prior quarters, there were no specific concentrations or geographic locations driving the losses in the quarter.
Current quarter CRE net charge-offs were $29.2 million, or an annualized 1.92% of average CRE loans. This was up $18.7 million, or 178%, from $10.5 million, or an annualized 0.72%, in the prior quarter. The vast majority of this increase was due to two larger charge-offs, with the remainder reflecting an increase from the 2012 first quarter low level.
Automobile loan and lease net charge-offs were $0.4 million, or an annualized 0.04% of related average balances, down 85% from $3.1 million, or an annualized 0.27% in the prior quarter. The significant decline in automobile net charge-offs reflected the positive impact of our continued commitment to high quality originations, the typical seasonality of the second quarter, and the continued strength in used car sales prices. We anticipate continued strength in the used car market throughout the remainder of 2012.
Residential mortgage net charge-offs in the second quarter were $10.8 million, up slightly from $10.6 million in the prior quarter. On an annualized basis, residential mortgage net charge-offs represented 0.82% of related loans, unchanged from the prior quarter.
Home equity net charge-offs were $21.0 million, or an annualized 1.01% of related average balances, down 11% from $23.7 million, or an annualized 1.15%, in the prior quarter.
Nonaccrual Loans (NALs) and Nonperforming Assets (NPAs)
Table 12  Nonaccrual Loans and Nonperforming Assets
 
 
Total nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) were $474.2 million at June 30, 2012 and represented 1.19% of total loans and leases. This was up $6.6 million, or 1%, from $467.6 million, or 1.15%, of total loans and leases, at the end of the prior quarter.
 
C&I NALs decreased $8.8 million, or 6%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting both NCO activity and problem credit resolutions, including payoffs. The decline was associated with loans throughout our footprint, with no specific industry concentration.
CRE NALs increased $14.3 million, or 7%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting a small number of higher-dollar amount loans. Although we anticipate some volatility, we expect that the long-term trend will show improvement.
Total other real estate owned decreased $10.1 million, or 21%, primarily reflecting sale activity during the current quarter.
Nonperforming assets (NPAs), which include NALs, were $523.3 million at June 30, 2012, and represented 1.31% of related assets. This was down $3.8 million, or 1%, from $527.1 million at the end of the prior quarter.
Table 13  Accruing Loans 90 Days Past Due and Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
 
 
Total accruing loans and leases over 90 days past due, excluding loans guaranteed by the U.S. Government, were $95.7 million at June 30, 2012, up $35.1 million, or 58%, from the end of the prior quarter, and up $38.0 million, or 66%, from the end of the year-ago period. On this same basis, the over 90-day delinquency ratio was 0.24% at June 30, 2012, up 9 basis points from both the end of the prior quarter as well as year-ago quarter. The increase in the 90-day accruing loans is a result of the accounting treatment for the Fidelity purchased impaired loan portfolio. In accordance with the FASB's ASC 310-30 accounting treatment, the loans are reported as accruing regardless of delinquency status. In the commercial portfolio, the legacy Huntington portfolio had no 90-day accruing delinquencies, consistent with our past quarterly performance.
 
Total troubled debt restructured loans were $782.0 million at June 30, 2012, up $5.9 million, or less than 1%, from March 31, 2012. Huntington continues to be proactive in the identification and treatment of troubled debts in both the commercial and retail portfolios.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain two reserves, both of which are available to absorb inherent credit losses: the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC). When summed together, these reserves constitute the total ACL.
Table 14  Allowance for Credit Losses
 
At June 30, 2012, the ALLL was $859.6 million, down $53.5 million, or 6%, from $913.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. Expressed as a percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at June 30, 2012, was 2.15%, down from 2.24% at March 31, 2012. The ALLL as a percent of NALs decreased to 181% at June 30, 2012, from 195% at March 31, 2012.
At June 30, 2012, the AULC was $51.0 million, up $0.1 million, or less than 1%, from the end of the prior quarter.
On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases at June 30, 2012, was 2.28%, down from 2.37% at the end of the prior quarter. The ACL allocated to the C&I portfolio specifically increased as a percentage of the total ACL as a result of the increases in balances. The ACL at the end of the 2012 second quarter as a percent of NALs decreased to 192% from 206% at the end of the prior quarter.
 
Capital
Table 15  Capital Ratios
 
The tangible common equity to asset ratio at June 30, 2012 was 8.41%, up 8 basis points from the prior quarter. Our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at quarter end was 10.08%, down from 10.15% at the end of the prior quarter. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio at June 30, 2012 was 11.93%, down from 12.22%, at March 31, 2012. This decline reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets due to balance sheet growth, the repurchasing of 6.4 million shares, and redemption of $80 million in trust preferred securities.
In the second quarter 2012, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The current estimated impact is a reduction of approximately 150 basis points to the Tier 1 Common risk-based capital ratio, which on a fully-phased-in pro forma basis, is estimated to be well above the proposed capital levels.

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this second quarter earnings conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington's website at
www.huntington-ir.com.
Significant Items
From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by Management to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by Management at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as "Significant Items". Most often, these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the company  e.g., regulatory actions/assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments/refunds, litigation actions, etc. In other cases they may result from Management decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business  e.g., merger/restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.
Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains/losses from investment activities, asset valuation write-downs, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item.
Management believes the disclosure of "Significant Items", when appropriate, aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items, if any, they may wish to include/exclude from their analysis of the company's performancei.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, Management has adopted a practice of listing "Significant Items" in its external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, quarterly performance discussions, investor presentations, Forms 10-Q and 10-K).
"Significant Items" for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. A number of items could materially impact these periods, including those described in Huntington's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors described from time to time in Huntington's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
Rounding
Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.
 

Exhibit 99.3
 
Notes:
The preparation of financial statement data in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
 
 
 
These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company's capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
