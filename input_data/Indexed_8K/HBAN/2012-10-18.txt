FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COLUMBUS, Ohio  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; ) reported 2012 third quarter net income of $167.8 million, up $15.1 million, or 10%, from $152.7 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per common share in the current quarter were $0.19, up $0.02 from the prior quarter. Net income in the year-ago quarter was $143.4 million, or $0.16 per common share.

Summary Performance Discussion
"We are pleased with the quarter's financial results which reflect steady growth in a number of key strategic areas including loans, deposits, and customer relationships. This demonstrates the continued benefits from successfully executing our strategic plan. This quarter was negatively impacted by an increase in healthcare and regulatory costs," said Stephen D. Steinour, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "At the core of our strategic plan remains a differentiated approach to banking, coupled with investing in products and services that are driving growth and improvement in the stability of our long-term profitability."
Net income in the third quarter was $167.8 million, up $15.1 million, or 10%, from $152.7 million in the prior quarter. The primary drivers of the increase were a $21.0 million, or 43%, decrease in provision for income taxes and a $7.2 million, or 3%, increase in noninterest income that were partially offset by a $14.0 million, or 3%, increase in noninterest expense. The decrease in provision for income taxes reflected the only significant item for the quarter, a $19.5 million state deferred tax valuation allowance benefit.
from the prior quarter. This reflected a $0.3 billion, or 1% (2% annualized), increase in average earning assets and a 4 basis point decrease in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin (NIM) to 3.38%. The linked-quarter decrease in the NIM reflected the negative impact of a 10 basis point decline of the yield on earnings assets, 6 basis points of which were related to the yield on loans. This was partially offset by the benefit of a 6 basis point reduction in total funding costs. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased $0.3 billion, or 8% annualized, and represented 27% of total deposits.
Net interest income increased $0.8 million, or less than 1%,
The $0.3 billion increase in average earning assets was driven by the $1.4 billion increase in average loans held for sale and a $0.2 billon, 6% annualized, increase in average commercial and industrial loans (C&I). That was partially offset by the $0.9 billion decrease in average automobile loans, reflecting the prior quarter's reclassification of $1.3 billion of automobile loans into held for sale, and a $0.4 billion decrease in commercial real estate loans.
Average total core deposits increased $1.0 billion, or 9% annualized, reflecting a $1.3 billion, or 40% annualized, increase in money market deposits and a $0.3 billion, or 9% annualized, increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits. These were partially offset by the $0.5 billion, or 29% annualized, decrease in core certificates of deposit (CDs) as customers were actively transitioned from CDs into more flexible money market accounts or other investment based solutions. Through our strategic focus on growing consumer households and commercial relationships by earning their primary checking (demand deposit) accounts, we continue to improve our overall funding mix. As previously disclosed, there remains over $1.0 billion of demand deposits from several larger relationships that are considered nonpermanent in nature.
, from the prior quarter. This included a $6.3 million, or 16%, increase in mortgage banking income and a $3.8 million increase in securities gains. Gain on sale of loans increased $2.5 million, or 60%, due to the sale of $0.2 billion of automobile loans that we classified as held for sale at the end of the prior quarter. These positive impacts were partially offset by a $4.4 million, or 16%, decrease in other income as the prior quarter included a gain on the sale of affordable housing investments.
%
Total noninterest income increased $7.2 million, or 3
 
Commenting on revenue trends, Steinour said, "The third quarter results clearly showed the continued benefit of the investment we have made over the preceding three years. Adding over 250,000 consumer households, a 27% increase, and 26,000 commercial relationships, or 21% increase, since the first quarter of 2010 has allowed Huntington to grow quarterly total revenue by more than $59 million even with the negative impacts from the low absolute level of interest rates, the flat shape of the yield curve, and the reduction of over $25 million of revenue per quarter due to the Durbin amendment and implementation of changes to Regulation E. Not only are we gaining customers, we are selling deeper with 76% of consumer checking account households and 33% of commercial relationships now with 4 or more products or services. Strategic investments have a maximum of two years to break even with many reaching that level in the first year. A portion of our strategic investments remain in the early stages, such as our strategy to build over 180 in-store full service branches. The in-store branches are on target with the estimated aggregate impact to operating income negligible next year and positive in 2014."
, from the prior quarter. This included a $4.7 million, or 2%, increase in personnel costs primarily reflecting higher healthcare costs and a $4.4 million increase in the cost associated with early extinguishment of debt including the trust preferred securities (TruPS) that were redeemed during the quarter. Noninterest expense included $4.5 million of expense related to the development of infrastructure and systems to support the Federal Reserve CCAR process.
Noninterest expense increased $14.0 million, or 3%
, from the prior quarter. This reflected a $20.9 million, or 25%, increase in net charge-offs (NCOs) to $105.1 million, or an annualized 1.05% of average total loans and leases, from $84.2 million, or an annualized 0.82%, in the prior quarter. Of this quarter's NCOs, $33.0 million related to regulatory guidance requiring consumer loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be charged down to collateral value. Approximately 90% continue to make payments as scheduled. Partially offsetting the increase in NCOs were significant improvement in asset quality trends, resulting in lower calculated reserves. Criticized commercial loans declined by $223 million, or 11%, in the quarter, and specific reserves associated with impaired commercial loans also declined.
The provision for credit losses increased $0.5 million, or 1%
The period-end allowance for credit losses (ACL) as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 2.09% from 2.28% in the prior quarter. The ACL as a percentage of period end total nonaccrual loans (NALs) was essentially unchanged, decreasing 3 percentage points to 189%. NALs declined by $29.1 million, or 6%, to $445.0 million, or 1.11% of total loans, during the quarter despite a $63 million increase associated with the revised treatment of Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.
, our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at September 30, 2012, was 10.28%, up from 10.08% at June 30, 2012, and our tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.74% from 8.41% over this same period. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio at September 30, 2012, was 11.88%, down from 11.93%, at June 30, 2012. This decline reflected the capital actions taken throughout the quarter, which are discussed below.
Capital
Over the quarter, and consistent with planned capital actions, redemption of $150 million of trust preferred securities (TruPS) was announced and 3.7 million common shares were repurchased at an average price of $6.68 per share. The weighted average coupon of the remaining $300 million of TruPS is LIBOR + 1.02%. Commenting on capital, Steinour said, "Reinvesting excess capital to grow the business organically remains our first priority. Importantly, through dividends and share repurchases, we have the flexibility, subject to market conditions, to return a meaningful amount of our earnings to the owners of the company."
 
Expectations
"We continue to see positive trends within our Midwest markets relative to the broader United States. Nevertheless, broad based customer sentiment began to change late in the quarter. Customers have increased concerns, in the near term, regarding the US economy as we approach the election and scheduled impacts of the Budget Control Act of 2011. We are optimistic that once permanent solutions are in place, the strength of the Midwest and the soundness of our strategy will continue to drive growth and improved profitability," said Steinour.
For the next several quarters, average net interest income is expected to be relatively stable from the third quarter's level as we anticipate an increase in total loans, excluding the impacts of any future loan securitizations. Those benefits to net interest income are expected to be mostly offset, however, by downward NIM pressure due to the anticipated competitive pressures on loan pricing, as well as lower rate securities through reinvestment, and declining positive impacts from deposit repricing. The C&I portfolio is expected to continue to show growth. Although, given the most recent trend, we are expecting near-term growth to be slower than the strong growth we experienced earlier this year. Our C&I sales pipeline remains robust with much of this reflecting the positive impact from our strategic initiatives, focused OCR sales process, and continued support of middle market and small business lending in the Midwest. We will continue to evaluate the use of automobile loan securitizations to limit total on-balance sheet exposure due to our expectation of continued strong levels of originations. On October 11, a $1.0 billion automobile loan securitization, with an approximate $17 million gain, was completed. Residential mortgages and home equity loan balances are expected to be relatively stable in response to the proposed capital rules recently released by our regulators. CRE loans likely will experience declines from current levels.
Excluding potential future automobile loan securitizations, we anticipate the increase in total loans will modestly outpace growth in total deposits. This reflects our continued focus on our overall cost of funds and the continued shift towards low- and no-cost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts.
Noninterest income, excluding the impact of any automobile loan sale or security gains and any net MSR impact, is expected to be relatively stable at current levels. Continued growth in new customers and increased contribution from higher cross-sell are expected to be offset by a slowdown in mortgage banking activity.
Noninterest expense is expected to modestly increase above the 2012 third quarter level. For the full year, we continue to anticipate positive operating leverage and modest improvement in our expense efficiency ratio. Additional regulatory costs and expenses associated with strategic actions, including the planned opening of over 80 in-store branches this year, are expected to be partially offset by our focus on improving expense efficiencies throughout the company.
Credit quality is expected to experience improvement. The level of provision for credit losses in the first three quarters of the year was at the low end of our long-term expectation, and we expect some quarterly volatility given the absolute low level of the provision for credit losses and the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery.
We anticipate the effective tax rate for the 2012 fourth quarter to approximate 24% to 26%, which includes permanent tax benefits primarily related to tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits.

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, the 2012 Third Quarter Performance Discussion and Quarterly Financial Review supplements to this document, the third quarter earnings conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington's website at .

Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
 
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.

The following provides detailed earnings performance discussion that complements the summary review contained in Huntington Bancshares Incorporated's (NASDAQ: HBAN) 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Press Release, which can be found at:
http://www.investquest.com/iq/h/hban/ne/news/
Table 1  Earnings Performance Summary
 
Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons
From time-to-time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items we judge to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that we believe their outsized impact at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We believe the disclosure of such "Significant Items", when appropriate, aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance trends.
(See Significant Items under the Basis of Presentation for a full discussion.)
Table 2 highlights the Significant Items impacting reported results for the current quarter, as there were no significant items in the prior and year ago quarters:
Table 2  Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparisons
 
 
Net Interest Income, Net Interest Margin, and Average Balance Sheet
Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income increased $0.8 million, or less than 1%, from the 2012 second quarter. This reflected the benefit of a $0.3 billion, or 1% (2% annualized), increase in average earning assets partially offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin (NIM) to 3.38%. The increase in average earnings assets reflected a $1.4 billion increase in average loans held for sale and a $0.2 billon, 6% annualized, increase in average commercial and industrial loans partially offset by the $0.9 billion decrease in average automobile loans, reflecting the prior quarter's reclassification of $1.3 billion of automobile loans into held for sale, and a $0.4 billion decrease in commercial real estate loans. The primary items impacting the decrease in the NIM were:
 
 
Partially offset by:

Average total loans and leases decreased $1.1 billion, or 3% (10% annualized), from the 2012 second quarter, primarily reflecting:
 
 
Partially offset by:
 
Compared to the year ago quarter, growth in average loans primarily reflected $2.6 billion of C&I loan growth, and two strategic decisions: the resumption of securitization activity and the acquisition of Fidelity Bank.
 
Table 4  Average Deposits
 
Average total core deposits increased $1.0 billion, or 2% (9% annualized), from the 2012 second quarter primarily reflecting:
 
 
Partially offset by:
 
Compared to the year ago quarter, growth in average total core deposits primarily reflected $3.6 billion of noninterest bearing deposit growth, of which $0.1 billion related to the Fidelity Bank transaction.
Non-core funding sources displayed significant mix shift due to the decision to replace maturing Federal Home Loan Bank advances with brokered deposits, reflecting the following changes from the prior quarter:
 
 
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses increased $0.5 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs (NCO) were $105.1 million, up 25% from $84.2 million in the prior quarter. NCOs were an annualized 1.05% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, up from 0.82% in the 2012 second quarter. Of this quarter's NCOs, $33.0 million, or an annualized 33 bp of average loans and leases, relate to Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans. The period end allowance for credit losses (ACL) as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 2.09% from 2.28%, while the ACL as a percentage of period end total nonaccrual loans (NALs) decreased slightly to 189% from 192% .

Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes in the 2012 third quarter was $28.3 million. This compared with a provision for income taxes of $49.3 million in the 2012 second quarter. The effective tax rates for the 2012 third and second quarter were 14.4% and 24.4%, respectively. At September 30, 2012, we had a net deferred tax asset of $201.5 million. Based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment to the deferred tax asset at September 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, there was no disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes.
Credit Quality Performance Discussion
Credit quality performance in the 2012 third quarter reflected continued improvement. NALs declined 6% to $445.0 million, or 1.11% of total loans, compared to $474.2 million, or 1.19% of total loans, in the prior quarter. NALs increased due to $63 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans. Net charge-offs (NCOs) increased compared to the prior quarter solely as a result of the $33.0 million impact to charge-offs related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans. NPAs declined $13.5 million, or 3%, compared to the prior quarter as the improvement in NALs was partially offset by an increase in commercial OREO.
 
Net Charge-Offs (NCOs)
Table 7  Net Charge-Offs
 
Total NCOs for the 2012 third quarter were $105.1 million, or an annualized 1.05% of average total loans and leases. This was up $20.9 million, or 25%, from $84.2 million, or an annualized 0.82%, in the prior quarter. Of the current quarter's NCOs, $33.0 million were related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.
Total C&I NCOs for the 2012 third quarter were $13.0 million, or an annualized 0.32%, down 17% from $15.7 million, or an annualized 0.39% of related loans, in the prior quarter.
Current quarter CRE net charge-offs were $17.4 million, or an annualized 1.21% of average CRE loans. This was down $11.8 million, or 40%, from $29.2 million, or an annualized 1.92%, in the prior quarter.
Automobile loan and lease net charge-offs were $4.0 million, or an annualized 0.40% of related average balances, up from $0.4 million, or an annualized 0.04%, in the prior quarter. Of the current quarter's NCOs, $2.0 million were related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.
Residential mortgage net charge-offs in the third quarter were $16.9 million, up from $10.8 million in the prior quarter. On an annualized basis, residential mortgage net charge-offs represented 1.30% of related loans, up from 0.82% of related loans in the prior quarter. Of the current quarter's NCOs, $8.0 million were related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.
Home equity net charge-offs were $46.6 million, or an annualized 2.23% of related average balances, up 121% from $21.0 million, or an annualized 1.01%, in the prior quarter. Of the current quarter's NCOs, $23.1 million were related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.
 
Nonaccrual Loans (NALs) and Nonperforming Assets (NPAs)
Table 8  Nonaccrual Loans and Nonperforming Assets
 
 
Total nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) were $445.0 million at September 30, 2012 and represented 1.11% of total loans and leases. This was down $29.1 million, or 6%, from $474.2 million, or 1.19% of total loans and leases, at the end of the prior quarter. Total NALs included $63.0 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.
C&I NALs decreased $24.2 million, or 18%, from the end of the prior quarter, with almost half of the decline associated with loans returned to accrual status, reflecting a continuation of successful workout strategies.
CRE NALs decreased $70.4 million, or 32%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting continued improvement in the underlying asset quality of the portfolio.
Automobile NALs increased from zero at the end of the prior quarter to $11.8 million, solely reflecting the Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.
Residential mortgage NALs increased $48.1 million, or 64%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting $46.3 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.
Home equity NALs increased $5.6 million, or 12%, from the end of the prior quarter, reflecting $4.9 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.
Total other real estate owned increased $15.6 million, or 40%, primarily reflecting the inclusion of one commercial property.
Nonperforming assets (NPAs), which include NALs, were $509.7 million at September 30, 2012 and represented 1.26% of related assets. This was a $13.5 million, or 3%, decrease from $523.3 million, or 1.31% of related assets, at the end of the prior quarter. NPAs included $63.0 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans.

Total accruing loans and leases over 90 days past due, excluding loans guaranteed by the U.S. Government, were $108.2 million at September 30, 2012, up $12.7 million, or 13%, from the end of the prior quarter, and up $47.2 million, or 77%, from the end of the year-ago period. On this same basis, the over 90-day delinquency ratio was 0.27% at September 30, 2012, up 3 basis points from the end of the prior quarter and up 11 basis points from the end of the year-ago quarter.
Total troubled debt restructured loans were $840.0 million at September 30, 2012, up $57.9 million, or 7%, from June 30, 2012 and included $71.0 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans. Huntington continues to be proactive in the identification and treatment of troubled debts in both the commercial and retail portfolios.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain two reserves, both of which are available to absorb inherent credit losses: the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC). When summed together, these reserves constitute the total ACL.
 
Table 10  Allowance for Credit Losses
 
At September 30, 2012, the ALLL was $789.1 million, down $70.5 million, or 8%, from $859.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Expressed as a percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at September 30, 2012, was 1.96%, down from 2.15% at June 30, 2012. The ALLL as a percent of NALs decreased to 177% at September 30, 2012, from 181% at June 30, 2012.
At September 30, 2012, the AULC was $53.6 million, up $2.6 million, or 5%, from the end of the prior quarter.
On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases at September 30, 2012, was 2.09%, down from 2.28% at the end of the prior quarter. The ACL at the end of the 2012 third quarter as a percent of NALs decreased to 189% from 192% at the end of the prior quarter.
Capital
Table 11  Capital Ratios
 
 
The tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio at September 30, 2012 was 8.74%, up 33 basis points from the prior quarter. Our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at quarter end was 10.28%, up from 10.08% at the end of the prior quarter. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio at September 30, 2012 was 11.88%, down from 11.93%, at June 30, 2012. This decline primarily reflected the redemption of $114.3 million in trust preferred securities and the repurchasing of 3.7 million shares.
 
Forward-looking Statement

Basis of Presentation
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document may contain GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this third quarter earnings conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington's website at .

Significant Items
From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by Management to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by Management at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as "Significant Items". Most often, these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the company  e.g., regulatory actions/assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments/refunds, litigation actions, etc. In other cases they may result from Management decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business  e.g., merger/restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.
Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains/losses from investment activities, asset valuation write-downs, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item.
Management believes the disclosure of "Significant Items", when appropriate, aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items, if any, they may wish to include/exclude from their analysis of the company's performancei.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, Management has adopted a practice of listing "Significant Items" in its external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, quarterly performance discussions, investor presentations, Forms 10-Q and 10-K).
"Significant Items" for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. A number of items could materially impact these periods, including those described in Huntington's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors described from time to time in Huntington's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Annualized data
Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.
Fully-taxable equivalent interest income and net interest margin
Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.
Earnings per share equivalent data
Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company's financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.
Rounding
Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.
 

Exhibit 99.3
 
Notes:
The preparation of financial statement data in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
Non-Regulatory Capital Ratios
In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
 
 
 
These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Company's capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company's calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
