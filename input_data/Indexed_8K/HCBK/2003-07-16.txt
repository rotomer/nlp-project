EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACT: LOUIS J. BEIERLE, VICE PRESIDENT, INVESTOR RELATIONS HUDSON CITY BANCORP, INC. WEST 80 CENTURY ROAD, PARAMUS, NEW JERSEY 07652 TELEPHONE: (201) 967-8290 E-MAIL: LJBEIERLE@HCSBNJ.COM HUDSON CITY BANCORP, INC. REPORTS 2003 SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND INCREASED TO $0.14 PER COMMON SHARE Paramus, New Jersey, July 15, 2003 - Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today the results of its operations for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2003. Net income was $52.5 million for the second quarter of 2003, an increase of $4.3 million, or 8.9%, compared with net income of $48.2 million for the second quarter of 2002. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.29 and $0.28, respectively, for the second quarter of 2003 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.26 and $0.25, respectively, for the second quarter of 2002. Hudson City Bancorp's annualized return on average stockholders' equity and annualized return on average assets for the second quarter of 2003 were 15.62% and 1.38%, respectively, compared with 14.83% and 1.54%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2002. Net income was $104.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003, an increase of $12.9 million, or 14.1%, compared with net income of $91.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2002. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.57 and $0.56, respectively, for the first six months of 2003 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.49 and $0.48, respectively, for the first six months of 2002. Hudson City Bancorp's annualized return on average stockholders' equity and annualized return on average assets for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 were 15.64% and 1.41%, respectively, compared with 14.16% and 1.50%, respectively, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2002. "It was our ability to grow our balance sheet in excess of $1.3 billion during the first six months of 2003, due to strong deposit growth, which allowed us to continue to experience strong earnings," said Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. The continuation of the historically low interest rate environment through the second quarter of 2003 has continued the high level of prepayment activity on the Company's mortgage-related assets. These lower rates caused the downward repricing of interest rates on our interest-earning assets and the acceleration of the amortization of the net premiums on our mortgage-related assets, resulting in the narrowing of our interest rate spread and net interest margin. This same low interest rate environment has also afforded us the opportunity to realize gains on certain of our available for sale securities. DIVIDEND DECLARED Hudson City Bancorp also reported that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per common share, representing an increase from the cash dividend of $0.12 per common share declared during the previous quarter. The cash dividend is payable on September 2, 2003 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 8, 2003. "Due to our strong earnings experience and our commitment to shareholder value, we raised our dividend nearly 17%, which further rewards our shareholders in light of the recent favorable tax law changes enacted by Congress," added Mr. Hermance.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION SUMMARY Total assets increased $1.32 billion, or 9.3%, to $15.46 billion at June 30, 2003 from $14.14 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in total assets reflected a $1.36 billion increase in investment securities available for sale, primarily callable government-sponsored agency securities. Loans decreased $98.7 million primarily due to the high level of prepayment activity experienced during the first six months of 2003. Hudson City Bancorp originated and purchased first mortgage loans of approximately $940.9 million and $851.4 million, respectively, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 compared with $974.3 million and $677.5 million, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2002. Loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one- to four-family mortgage loans. Included in mortgage loan originations were refinanced mortgage loans of $255.7 million for the first six months of 2003. Modifications of existing mortgage loans during the first six months of 2003, which are not included in mortgage loan originations, amounted to $878.8 million. Total liabilities increased $1.27 billion, or 9.9%, to $14.10 billion at June 30, 2003 from $12.83 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in total liabilities reflected an increase in total deposits of $827.5 million and an increase in borrowed funds of $450.0 million. The increase in total deposits reflected an increase in our interest-bearing High Value Checking account of approximately $915.4 million during the first six months of 2003 to $1.86 billion at June 30, 2003. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of securing $550.0 million of new borrowings with initial repricing dates ranging from three months to two years. During the first six months of 2003, we also restructured certain of our borrowed funds, which resulted in the extension of the weighted-average maturity and lower contract interest rates. Total stockholders' equity increased $38.5 million, or 2.9%, to $1.35 billion at June 30, 2003 from $1.32 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily due to net income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 of $104.7 million and an $8.5 million increase due to the exercise of 1.2 million stock options. These increases were partially offset by repurchases of 1.7 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $36.9 million and cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $42.4 million. As of June 30, 2003 there remained 9.6 million shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase programs. Our stockholders' equity to asset ratio at June 30, 2003 was 8.76%. STATEMENT OF INCOME SUMMARY Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended June 30, 2003 decreased $3.8 million, or 1.9%, to $192.7 million compared with $196.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 121 basis points in the annualized weighted average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 5.18% for the second quarter of 2003 compared with 6.39% for the second quarter of 2002. Partially offsetting the effect of the decrease in the weighted-average yield was an increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets of $2.56 billion, or 20.8%, to $14.87 billion for the second quarter of 2003. The decrease in total interest and dividend income reflected the overall decrease in long-term market interest rates and the resulting higher levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets, which increased the amortization of the net premiums on these assets. Interest on mortgage loans decreased $10.4 million, or 9.4%, to $100.8 million for the second quarter of 2003 primarily due to a 93 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield. Interest on total mortgage-backed securities decreased $12.0 million, or 15.3%, to $66.3 million for the second quarter of 2003 primarily due to a 139 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield. Interest and dividends on investment securities increased $17.8 million to $20.8 million for the second quarter of 2003 primarily due to an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $1.53 billion to $1.73 billion for the second quarter of 2003. Page 6
Total interest and dividend income increased $6.1 million, or 1.6%, to $391.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 compared with $385.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2002. This increase primarily reflected an increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets of $2.53 billion, or 21.1%, to $14.52 billion for the first six months of 2003 compared with $11.99 billion for the corresponding 2002 period. Partially offsetting the effect of the increase in the average balance was a decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets of 104 basis points to 5.39% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 compared with 6.43% for the corresponding 2002 period. The growth in the average balance of interest-earning assets reflected balance sheet growth consistent with the growth strategies we have employed over recent periods. The decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets reflected the overall decrease in long-term market interest rates and the resulting higher levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets, which increased the amortization of the net premiums on these assets. Interest on mortgage loans decreased $9.3 million, or 4.3%, to $207.5 million for the first six months of 2003 primarily due to an 81 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield. Interest on total mortgage-backed securities decreased $12.9 million, or 8.3%, to $141.8 million for the first six months of 2003 primarily due to a 119 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield. Interest and dividends on investment securities increased $26.9 million to $32.5 million for the first six months of 2003 primarily due to an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $1.12 billion to $1.31 billion for the first six months of 2003. Total interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2003 decreased $4.5 million, or 4.5%, to $94.6 million compared with $99.1 million for the corresponding period of 2002, notwithstanding an overall increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. This decrease was due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities of 85 basis points to 2.85% for the three-month period ended June 30, 2003 compared with 3.70% for the three-month period ended June 30, 2002. The lower annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the overall declining interest rate environment experienced during 2002 and the resulting low short-term interest rate environment that continued through the first six months of 2003. The decrease also reflected the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds, which lowered the contract rates and extended the overall weighted-average maturity. The average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities increased $2.57 billion, or 23.9%, to $13.32 billion for the second quarter of 2003 compared with $10.75 billion for the second quarter of 2002. Interest expense on deposits decreased $11.0 million, or 17.0%, to $53.7 million for the second quarter of 2003 primarily due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of 96 basis points, while the average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $1.42 billion, primarily reflecting an increase in the average balance of our High Value Checking account. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $6.5 million, or 18.9%, to $40.9 million for the second quarter of 2003 primarily due to an increase in the average balance of $1.15 billion, or 41.4%, to $3.93 billion. Total interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2003 decreased $5.8 million, or 3.0%, to $190.5 million compared with $196.3 million for the corresponding period of 2002, notwithstanding an overall increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. This decrease was due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities of 83 basis points to 2.96% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 compared with 3.79% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2002. The lower annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the overall declining interest rate environment experienced during 2002 and the resulting low short-term interest rate environment that continued through the first six months of 2003. The decrease also reflected the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds, which lowered the contract rates and extended the overall weighted-average maturity. The average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities increased $2.55 billion, or 24.4%, to $12.99 billion for the first six months of 2003 compared with $10.44 billion for the first six months of 2002. Interest expense on deposits decreased $22.8 million, or 17.2%, to $109.4 million for the first six months of 2003 primarily due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of 100 basis points, while the Page 7
average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $1.33 billion, primarily reflecting an increase in the average balance of our High Value Checking account. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $17.1 million, or 26.7%, to $81.2 million for the first six months of 2003 primarily due to an increase in the average balance of $1.22 billion, or 47.1%, to $3.81 billion. Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2003 increased $0.7 million, or 0.7%, to $98.1 million compared with $97.4 million for the corresponding period in 2002. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets, was 2.33% for the second quarter of 2003 compared with 2.69% for the corresponding period in 2002. For the second quarter of 2003, our net interest margin, determined by dividing annualized net interest income by total average interest-earning assets, was 2.63% compared with 3.16% for the corresponding 2002 period. Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 increased $11.8 million, or 6.2%, to $200.6 million compared with $188.8 million for the corresponding period in 2002. Our net interest rate spread was 2.43% for the first six months of 2003 compared with 2.64% for the corresponding period in 2002. For the first six months of 2003, our net interest margin was 2.74% compared with 3.12% for the corresponding 2002 period. During 2002 and the first six months of 2003, long-term interest rates generally declined, while short-term interest rates remained relatively stable, despite a 25 basis point decrease in the fed funds target rate late in the second quarter of 2003. The resulting flatter yield curve and the increased prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets, due to the historically low market interest rates, may have an adverse impact on our net interest income, net interest rate spread and net interest margin in future periods. The provision for loan losses for the three-month period ended June 30, 2003 was $225,000 compared with $525,000 for the corresponding 2002 period. The provision for loan losses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 was $450,000 compared with $1.1 million for the corresponding 2002 period. Net charge-offs for the first six months of 2003 were $31,000 compared with $5,000 for the corresponding 2002 period. The allowance for loan losses increased $0.4 million to $25.9 million at June 30, 2003 compared with $25.5 million at December 31, 2002. Non-performing loans at June 30, 2003 were $22.8 million compared with $20.2 million at December 31, 2002. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans increased to 0.33% at June 30, 2003 from 0.29% at December 31, 2002. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 113.49% at June 30, 2003 compared with 126.27% at December 31, 2002. Total non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2003 was $9.9 million compared with $1.3 million for the corresponding 2002 period. Total non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $15.4 million compared with $2.4 million for the corresponding 2002 period. These increases in total non-interest income reflected gains on securities transactions, net. The gains on securities transactions, net, of $8.6 million in the second quarter of 2003 and $12.8 million in the first six months of 2003 resulted from an opportunity to realize gains from the sale of certain available for sale securities prior to interest rate changes which may have adversely affected their fair market value. The cash flows from the sales of these securities were reinvested in fixed-rate securities with shorter maturities. Total non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 was $24.9 million and $23.1 million, respectively. Our efficiency ratio for the three months ended June 30, 2003, determined by dividing total non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and total non-interest income, was 23.07% compared with 23.39% for the corresponding 2002 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the three months ended June 30, 2003 was 0.66% compared with 0.74% for the corresponding period in 2002. Total non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 was $50.4 million and $47.2 million, respectively. Our efficiency ratio for the six months Page 8
ended June 30, 2003 was 23.34% compared with 24.71% for the corresponding 2002 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was 0.68% compared with 0.77% for the corresponding period in 2002. Non-interest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits, net occupancy expense and other expenses. Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2003 was $30.3 million compared with $26.9 million for the corresponding 2002 period. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $60.4 million compared with $51.1 million for the corresponding 2002 period. These increases in income tax expense were primarily due to increases in income before income tax expense and changes to the New Jersey corporate business tax rates in 2002. Hudson City Bancorp maintains its corporate office in Paramus, New Jersey. Hudson City Savings Bank is the largest savings bank based in New Jersey. Hudson City Savings currently operates 81 full-service branches in fourteen New Jersey counties and has 1,025 full-time equivalent employees.
