REPORTS 2003 THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND INCREASED TO $0.15 PER COMMON SHARE BANKING SUBSIDIARY ANNOUNCES APPLICATION TO CONVERT TO OTS CHARTER Paramus, New Jersey, October 16, 2003 - Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today net income of $50.3 million for the third quarter of 2003, an increase of $700,000, or 1.4%, compared with net income of $49.6 million for the third quarter of 2002. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.28 and $0.27, respectively, for the third quarter of 2003 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.27 and $0.26, respectively, for the third quarter of 2002. Hudson City Bancorp's annualized return on average stockholders' equity and annualized return on average assets for the third quarter of 2003 were 14.74% and 1.28%, respectively, compared with 15.40% and 1.52%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2002. Net income was $155.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003, an increase of $13.6 million, or 9.6%, compared with net income of $141.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.85 and $0.83, respectively, for the first nine months of 2003 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.76 and $0.74, respectively, for the first nine months of 2002. Hudson City Bancorp's annualized return on average stockholders' equity and annualized return on average assets for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 were 15.34% and 1.37%, respectively, compared with 14.57% and 1.51%, respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002. "Our focus on increasing customer deposits has allowed us to grow our balance sheet in excess of $1.7 billion during the first nine months of 2003," said Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. "This balance sheet growth has enabled us to exceed the exceptional earnings reported in comparable periods in 2002, despite the current low interest rate environment which has narrowed our net interest margin," added Mr. Hermance. DIVIDEND DECLARED Hudson City Bancorp also reported that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, representing an increase from the cash dividend of $0.14 per common share declared during the previous quarter. The cash dividend is payable on December 1, 2003 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 7, 2003. BOARD ACTION The Board of Directors of Hudson City Savings Bank, the banking subsidiary of Hudson City Bancorp, Inc., authorized the filing of an application with the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") to convert to a federally chartered savings bank. This application is expected to be filed shortly. Under this new charter, the OTS would become the sole regulator of the Bank. "We believe that our business model is better aligned with the objectives of the OTS. We also believe the conversion to a federal charter will give us greater flexibility for future growth," said Mr. Hermance. Hudson City Savings' deposits will continue to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Page 5
STATEMENT OF INCOME SUMMARY The continuation of the low interest rate environment through September 2003, notwithstanding the modest increase in long-term interest rates during the third quarter of 2003, has continued the high level of prepayment, refinancing and modification activity on our mortgage-related assets. The higher levels of prepayment activity caused a decrease in the overall contract interest rate earned on our interest-earning assets and an acceleration of the amortization of the net premiums on our mortgage-related assets, resulting in the narrowing of our interest rate spread and net interest margin. This same low interest rate environment has also afforded us the opportunity to realize gains on certain of our mortgage-backed and investment securities. Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended September 30, 2003 decreased $13.6 million, or 6.8%, to $186.7 million compared with $200.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 142 basis points in the annualized weighted average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 4.86% for the third quarter of 2003 compared with 6.28% for the third quarter of 2002. Partially offsetting the effect of the decrease in the weighted-average yield was an increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets of $2.59 billion, or 20.3%, to $15.36 billion for the third quarter of 2003 from $12.77 billion for the third quarter of 2002. The decrease in total interest and dividend income reflected the overall decrease in long-term market interest rates, notwithstanding the modest increase in long-term rates in the third quarter of 2003, and the resulting higher levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets, which increased the amortization of the net premiums on these assets. Interest and fees on mortgage loans decreased $17.1 million, when comparing the third quarter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to a 124 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield. Interest on total mortgage-backed securities decreased $12.0 million, when comparing the third quarter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to a 136 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield. Interest and dividends on investment securities increased $16.9 million, when comparing the third quarter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $1.68 billion. The decrease in dividend income from Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB") stock, and the resulting low annualized weighted average yield, was due to the recent announcement by the FHLB that it was not paying a dividend. We do not anticipate reporting FHLB dividend income in the fourth quarter of 2003 due to this announcement. Total interest and dividend income decreased $7.5 million, or 1.3%, to $577.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 compared with $585.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002. This decrease primarily reflected a decrease in the annualized weighted average yield on interest-earning assets of 116 basis points to 5.21% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 compared with 6.37% for the corresponding 2002 period. Partially offsetting the effect of the decrease in the annualized weighted average yield was an increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets of $2.55 billion, or 20.8%, to $14.80 billion for the first nine months of 2003 compared with $12.25 billion for the corresponding 2002 period. The decrease in total interest and dividend income reflected the overall decrease in long-term market interest rates, notwithstanding the modest increase in long-term rates in the third quarter of 2003, and the resulting higher levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets, which increased the amortization of the net premiums on these assets. Interest and fees on mortgage loans decreased $26.4 million, when comparing the first nine months of 2003 to the first nine months of 2002, primarily due to a 96 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield. Interest on total mortgage-backed securities decreased $24.9 million, when comparing the first nine months of 2003 to the first nine months of 2002, primarily due to a 124 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield. Interest and dividends on investment securities Page 6
increased $43.8 million, when comparing the first nine months of 2003 to the first nine months of 2002, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $1.31 billion. Total interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2003 decreased $8.4 million, or 8.4%, to $92.0 million compared with $100.4 million for the corresponding period of 2002, notwithstanding an overall increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. This decrease was due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities of 90 basis points to 2.64% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2003 compared with 3.54% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2002. The lower annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the overall declining interest rate environment experienced during 2002 and the resulting low short-term interest rate environment that continued through the first nine months of 2003. The decrease also reflected the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds, which lowered the contract rates and extended the overall weighted-average maturity. The average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities increased $2.55 billion, or 22.6%, to $13.81 billion for the third quarter of 2003 compared with $11.26 billion for the third quarter of 2002. Interest expense on deposits decreased $13.2 million, when comparing the third quarter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of 97 basis points, while the average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $1.38 billion, primarily reflecting an increase in the average balance of our High Value Checking account. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $4.8 million, when comparing the third quarter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of $1.16 billion. Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 decreased $14.2 million, or 4.8%, to $282.5 million compared with $296.7 million for the corresponding period of 2002, notwithstanding an overall increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. This decrease was due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities of 85 basis points to 2.85% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 compared with 3.70% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002. The lower annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the overall declining interest rate environment experienced during 2002 and the resulting low short-term interest rate environment that continued through the first nine months of 2003. The decrease also reflected the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds, which lowered the contract rates and extended the overall weighted-average maturity. The average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities increased $2.54 billion, or 23.7%, to $13.26 billion for the first nine months of 2003 compared with $10.72 billion for the first nine months of 2002. Interest expense on deposits decreased $36.0 million, when comparing the first nine months of 2003 to the first nine months of 2002, primarily due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of 99 basis points, while the average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $1.35 billion, primarily reflecting an increase in the average balance of our High Value Checking account. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $21.8 million, when comparing the first nine months of 2003 to the first nine months of 2002, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of $1.20 billion. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2003 decreased $5.2 million, or 5.2%, to $94.7 million compared with $99.9 million for the corresponding period in 2002. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets, was 2.22% for the third quarter of 2003 compared with 2.74% for the corresponding period in 2002. For the third quarter of 2003, our net interest margin, determined by dividing annualized net interest income by total average interest-earning assets, was 2.49% compared with 3.16% for the corresponding 2002 period. Net interest income Page 7
for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 increased $6.6 million, or 2.3%, to $295.3 million compared with $288.7 million for the corresponding period in 2002. Our net interest rate spread was 2.36% for the first nine months of 2003 compared with 2.67% for the corresponding period in 2002. For the first nine months of 2003, our net interest margin was 2.65% compared with 3.13% for the corresponding 2002 period. During 2002 and the first nine months of 2003, long-term interest rates generally declined, while short-term interest rates remained relatively stable, notwithstanding a modest increase in long-term rates during the third quarter of 2003. As our interest-earning assets generally price off long-term market rates and our interest-bearing liabilities generally price off short-term market rates, the larger decrease in the annualized yield on interest-earning assets, as compared to the decrease in the annualized cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reflected the timing of the impact of the market rate decreases. The flatter yield curve, due to the market rate decreases, the timing of the impact on earnings of the market rate changes, and the increased prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets, due to the historically low market interest rates, caused the decreases in our net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2003, and the decreases to our net interest rate spread and net interest margin for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003. This effect may impact net interest income, net interest rate spread and net interest margin in future periods. The provision for loan losses for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 was $225,000. The provision for loan losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 was $675,000 compared with $1.3 million for the corresponding 2002 period. Net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2003 were $77,000 compared with $5,000 for the corresponding 2002 period. The allowance for loan losses increased $0.6 million to $26.1 million at September 30, 2003 compared with $25.5 million at December 31, 2002. Non-performing loans at September 30, 2003 were $22.6 million compared with $20.2 million at December 31, 2002. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.30% at September 30, 2003 compared with 0.29% at December 31, 2002. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 115.71% at September 30, 2003 compared with 126.27% at December 31, 2002. Total non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2003 was $9.4 million compared with $1.4 million for the corresponding 2002 period. Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $24.8 million compared with $3.8 million for the corresponding 2002 period. These increases in total non-interest income reflected gains on securities transactions, net. The gains on securities transactions, net, of $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2003 and $20.5 million in the first nine months of 2003 resulted from an opportunity to realize gains from the sale of certain mortgage-backed and investment securities prior to interest rate changes which may have adversely affected their fair market value. The lower current interest rate environment, which caused the acceleration of the amortization of the net premium on our mortgage-related assets, also enabled us to realize these gains on the sales of securities, as the lower rate environment increased the fair value of the securities. The cash flows from the sales of these securities were reinvested in fixed-rate securities. Total non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 was $25.6 million and $23.0 million, respectively. Our efficiency ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2003, determined by dividing total non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and total non-interest income, was 24.60% compared with 22.68% for the corresponding 2002 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the three months ended September 30, 2003 was 0.65% compared with 0.70% for the corresponding period in 2002. Total non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 was $76.0 million and $70.2 million, respectively. Our efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was 23.75% compared with 24.00% for Page 8
the corresponding 2002 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was 0.67% compared with 0.75% for the corresponding period in 2002. Non-interest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits, net occupancy expense and other expenses. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2003 was $28.0 million compared with $28.5 million for the corresponding 2002 period. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $88.4 million compared with $79.6 million for the corresponding 2002 period. The increase in income tax expense were primarily due to increases in income before income tax expense. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION SUMMARY Total assets increased $1.76 billion, or 12.4%, to $15.90 billion at September 30, 2003 from $14.14 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in total assets reflected a $1.63 billion increase in investment securities available for sale and an increase in loans of $496.6 million. Hudson City Bancorp originated and purchased first mortgage loans of approximately $1.77 billion and $1.79 billion, respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 compared with $1.35 billion and $955.3 million, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2002. Loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one- to four-family mortgage loans. Included in mortgage loan originations were refinanced mortgage loans of $419.3 million for the first nine months of 2003. Modifications of existing mortgage loans during the first nine months of 2003, which are not included in mortgage loan originations, amounted to $1.43 billion. Total liabilities increased $1.72 billion, or 13.4%, to $14.55 billion at September 30, 2003 from $12.83 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in total liabilities reflected an increase in total deposits of $1.11 billion and an increase in borrowed funds of $600.0 million. The increase in total deposits reflected an increase in our interest-bearing High Value Checking account of approximately $1.35 billion during the first nine months of 2003 to $2.29 billion at September 30, 2003. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of securing $850.0 million of new borrowings with initial repricing dates ranging from three months to two years, partly offset by calls and maturities of $250.0 million. During the first nine months of 2003, we also restructured certain of our borrowed funds, which resulted in the extension of the weighted-average maturity and lower contract interest rates. Total stockholders' equity increased $37.1 million, or 2.8%, to $1.35 billion at September 30, 2003 from $1.32 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily due to net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 of $155.0 million and a $9.4 million increase due to the exercise of approximately 1.4 million stock options. These increases were partially offset by repurchases of approximately 2.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $46.4 million, cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $71.0 million and a $22.8 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment portfolio reflecting recent increases in longer term interest rates. As of September 30, 2003 there remained approximately 9.2 million shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. Our stockholders' equity to asset ratio at September 30, 2003 was 8.51%. Page 9
