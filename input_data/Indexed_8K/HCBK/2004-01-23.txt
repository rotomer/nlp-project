Exhibit 99.1
Paramus, New Jersey, January 22, 2004 - Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today net income of $52.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of $1.7 million, or 3.4%, compared with net income of $50.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.29 and $0.28, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.28 and $0.27, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2002. Hudson City Bancorp's annualized return on average stockholders' equity and annualized return on average assets for the fourth quarter of 2003 were 15.50% and 1.28%, respectively, compared with 15.62% and 1.49%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2002.
Net income was $207.4 million for 2003, an increase of $15.4 million, or 8.0%, compared with net income of $192.0 million for 2002. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.14 and $1.11, respectively, for 2003 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $1.04 and $1.01, respectively, for 2002. Hudson City Bancorp's return on average stockholders' equity and return on average assets for 2003 were 15.38% and 1.34%, respectively, compared with 14.84% and 1.50%, respectively, for 2002.
"Declining interest rates in the first half of 2003 caused record levels of prepayments and re-pricing of mortgage-related assets for the thrift industry, particularly portfolio lenders," said Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. "Yet, despite this challenge, we were able to increase assets over 20% for the year, report growth in net interest income and net income from the prior year, continue our stock repurchase program, and increase our dividend every quarter in 2003," added Mr. Hermance.
Dividend Declared
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share, representing an increase from the cash dividend of $0.15 per common share declared during the previous quarter. The cash dividend is payable on March 1, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 6, 2004.

Statement of Income Summary
Market interest rates, while still at historical lows, were generally stable during the fourth quarter of 2003. This stability followed general market interest rate declines, primarily in long-term market interest rates, during the first half of 2003. The stabilization of interest rates decreased the prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets in the fourth quarter from the high volume of prepayment activity seen in the prior three quarters of 2003. The decrease in the prepayment activity resulted in a decrease in the amortization of the net premiums on our mortgage-related assets, which increased the yield on these assets. The interest rate environment during 2003 also afforded us the opportunity to realize gains on certain of our mortgage-backed and investment securities.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended December 31, 2003 increased $648,000, or 0.3%, to $199.5 million compared with $198.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $2.76 billion, or 20.7%, to $16.10 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2003 from $13.34 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2002, reflecting planned growth. Offsetting the effect of the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was a decrease of 101 basis points in the annualized weighted average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 4.95% for the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with 5.96% for the fourth quarter of 2002, reflecting the overall decrease in long-term market interest rates experienced during 2003. The increase in interest and fees on mortgage loans of $789,000 was primarily due to the growth in the average balance of $1.31 billion, reflecting internal growth initiatives. The $14.6 million decrease in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to the decrease in the average balance of $245.0 million, due to high levels of prepayment activity and sales, and the decrease in the weighted average yield of 82 basis points, due to the historical low market interest rates. The increase in interest and dividends on investment securities of $17.4 million was primarily due to growth in the average balance of $1.76 billion, due to the investment of part of the cash flow from the high levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets.
Total interest and dividend income decreased $6.9 million, or 0.9%, to $777.3 million for 2003 compared with $784.2 million for 2002. This decrease primarily reflected a decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets of 112 basis points to 5.14% for 2003 compared with 6.26% for 2002. Partially offsetting the effect of the decrease in the weighted average yield was an increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets of $2.61 billion, or 20.8%, to $15.13 billion for 2003 compared with $12.52 billion 2002, reflecting planned growth. The decrease in total interest and dividend income reflected the overall decrease in long-term market interest rates during 2003 and the resulting higher levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets, which increased the amortization of the net premiums on these assets. The decrease in interest and fees on mortgage loans of $25.7 million was primarily due to a 100 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield due to the declining market interest rates of 2003. The $39.5 million decrease in interest on total mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to a 112 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield due to the declining market interest rate environment experienced during 2003. Interest and dividends on investment securities increased $61.1 million primarily due to an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $1.42 billion due to the investment of part of the cash flow from the high levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets.
Total interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2003 decreased $5.2 million, or 5.3%, to $93.8 million compared with $99.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2002, notwithstanding an overall increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. This decrease was due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities of 76 basis points to 2.56% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2003 compared with 3.32% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2002. Partially offsetting the effect of the decrease in the annualized cost was an increase
 
in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $2.70 billion, or 22.8%, to $14.54 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared with $11.84 billion for the corresponding period in 2002. The lower annualized average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the overall declining interest rate environment experienced during 2003. The decrease also reflected the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds, which lowered the contract rates and extended the overall weighted-average maturity. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing demand deposits of $8.2 million was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits of $1.82 billion, due to the growth of our High Value Checking account product. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds of $5.2 million was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $1.34 billion, which, along with the increase in deposits, funded our growth initiatives. The decrease in interest expense on time deposits of $15.6 million was primarily due to a decrease in the annualized average cost of 82 basis points, due to the low market interest rate environment.
Total interest expense for 2003 decreased $19.4 million, or 4.9%, to $376.4 million compared with $395.8 million for 2002, notwithstanding an overall increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. This decrease was due to a decrease in the average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities of 83 basis points to 2.77% for 2003 compared with 3.60% for 2002. Partially offsetting the effect of the decrease in the cost was an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $2.58 billion, or 23.5%, to $13.58 billion for 2003 compared with $11.00 billion for 2002. The lower average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the overall declining interest rate environment experienced during 2003. The decrease also reflected the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds, which lowered the contract rates and extended the overall weighted-average maturity. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing demand deposits of $34.0 million was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits of $1.60 billion, due to the growth of our High Value Checking account product. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds of $27.0 million was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $1.24 billion, which, along with the increase in deposits, funded our growth initiatives. The decrease in interest expense on time deposits of $69.1 million was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of 96 basis points, due to the low market interest rate environment of 2003.
Net interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2003 increased $5.8 million, or 5.8%, to $105.6 million compared with $99.8 million for the corresponding period in 2002. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets, was 2.39% for the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with 2.64% for the corresponding period in 2002. For the fourth quarter of 2003, our net interest margin, determined by dividing annualized net interest income by total average interest-earning assets, was 2.64% compared with 3.02% for the corresponding 2002 period. Net interest income for 2003 increased $12.6 million, or 3.2%, to $401.0 million compared with $388.4 million for 2002. Our net interest rate spread was 2.37% for 2003 compared with 2.66% for 2002. For 2003, our net interest margin was 2.65% compared with 3.10% for 2002.
The increase in net interest income reflected the growth initiatives employed during 2003. The decrease in the net interest rate spread and net interest margin reflected the general decline in long-term interest rates during 2003, and the relative stability of short-term interest rates during that same period. As our interest-earning assets generally price off long-term market rates and our interest-bearing liabilities generally price off short-term market rates, the larger decrease in the annualized yield on interest-earning assets, as compared to the decrease in the annualized cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reflected the timing of the impact of the market rate decreases. The flatter yield curve due to the decline of long-term interest rates in 2003, the timing of the impact of the market rate changes, and the increased prepayment activity and acceleration of the amortization of the net premium on our mortgage-related assets, caused
 
the decreases in our net interest rate spread and net interest margin. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the net interest rate spread and the net interest margin increased from the prior quarters reported in 2003 due to the decrease in prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets and the subsequent decrease in the amortization of the net premium. If market interest rates remain stable and the prepayment activity continues to decrease or stabilize, we expect this upward trend in the net interest rate spread and the net interest margin to continue in 2004.
The provision for loan losses for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $225,000. The provision for loan losses for 2003 was $900,000 compared with $1.5 million for 2002. Net recoveries for 2003 were $146,000 compared with net charge-offs of $9,000 for 2002. The allowance for loan losses increased $1.0 million to $26.5 million at December 31, 2003 compared with $25.5 million at December 31, 2002. Non-performing loans at December 31, 2003 were $20.3 million compared with $20.2 million at December 31, 2002. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.23% at December 31, 2003 compared with 0.29% at December 31, 2002. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 131.09% at December 31, 2003 compared with 126.27% at December 31, 2002.
Total non-interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2003 was $4.8 million compared with $4.2 million for the corresponding 2002 period. Total non-interest income for 2003 was $29.7 million compared with $8.0 million for 2002. These increases in total non-interest income reflected higher gains on securities transactions, net, partially offset by a decline in service charges and other income. The gains on securities transactions, net, of $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and $24.3 million in 2003 resulted from an opportunity to realize gains from the sale of certain mortgage-backed and investment securities prior to interest rate changes which would have adversely affected their fair market value. The lower current interest rate environment, which caused the acceleration of the amortization of the net premium on our mortgage-related assets, enabled us to realize these gains on the sales of securities, as the lower rates increased the fair value of these securities. The cash flows from the sales of these securities were reinvested in fixed-rate securities.
Total non-interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $26.5 million and $23.3 million, respectively. Our efficiency ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2003, determined by dividing total non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and total non-interest income, was 23.97% compared with 22.44% for the corresponding 2002 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the three months ended December 31, 2003 was 0.65% compared with 0.68% for the corresponding period in 2002. Total non-interest expense for 2003 and 2002 was $102.5 million and $93.5 million, respectively. Our efficiency ratio for 2003 was 23.81% compared with 23.59% for 2002. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for 2003 was 0.66% compared with 0.73% for 2002. Non-interest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits, net occupancy expense and other expenses. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefits, due to routine salary increases, increases in pension expense, and increases in employee stock ownership plan expense that is based on the current price of our stock.
Income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2003 was $31.4 million compared with $29.8 million for the corresponding 2002 period. The effective rate for the fourth quarter of 2003 was 37.44% compared with 37.02% for the fourth quarter of 2002. Income tax expense for 2003 was $119.8 million compared with $109.4 million for 2002. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 36.61% compared with 36.29% for 2002. The increases in income tax expense were primarily due to increases in income before income tax expense.
 
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $2.89 billion, or 20.4%, to $17.03 billion at December 31, 2003 from $14.14 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in total assets reflected a $1.83 billion increase in loans and a $1.68 billion increase in investment securities available for sale. Hudson City Bancorp originated and purchased first mortgage loans of approximately $2.17 billion and $3.21 billion, respectively, for 2003 compared with $1.84 billion and $1.72 billion, respectively, for 2002. Loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one- to four-family mortgage loans. Included in mortgage loan originations were refinanced mortgage loans of $530.4 million for 2003. Modifications of existing mortgage loans during 2003, which are not included in mortgage loan originations, amounted to $1.46 billion.
Total liabilities increased $2.87 billion, or 22.4%, to $15.70 billion at December 31, 2003 from $12.83 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in total liabilities reflected an increase in total deposits of $1.31 billion and an increase in borrowed funds of $1.55 billion. The increase in total deposits reflected an increase in our interest-bearing High Value Checking account of approximately $1.77 billion during 2003 to $2.71 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of securing $2.03 billion of new borrowings with initial repricing dates ranging from three months to three years, partially offset by calls and maturities of $475.0 million. During 2003 we also restructured certain of our borrowed funds, which resulted in the extension of the weighted-average maturity and lower contract interest rates.
Total stockholders' equity increased $13.3 million, or 1.0%, to $1.33 billion at December 31, 2003 from $1.32 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily due to net income for 2003 of $207.4 million, an $11.0 million increase due to the exercise of approximately 1.5 million stock options and a $14.2 million increase due to the commitment of shares for our employee stock benefit plans. These increases were partially offset by repurchases of approximately 3.7 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $101.1 million, cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $99.6 million and a $30.2 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment portfolio reflecting recent increases in longer term interest rates. As of December 31, 2003 there remained approximately 7.7 million shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. Our stockholders' equity to asset ratio at December 31, 2003 was 7.80%.
