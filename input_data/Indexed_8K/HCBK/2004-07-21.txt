Paramus, New Jersey, July 21, 2004  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today the results of its operations for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004. Net income was $58.4 million for the second quarter of 2004, an increase of $5.9 million, or 11.2%, compared with net income of $52.5 million for the second quarter of 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were both $0.32 for the second quarter of 2004 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.29 and $0.28, respectively, for the second quarter of 2003. Hudson City Bancorp's annualized return on average stockholders' equity and annualized return on average assets for the second quarter of 2004 were 16.98% and 1.28%, respectively, compared with 15.62% and 1.38%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2003.
Net income was $114.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004, an increase of $9.9 million, or 9.5%, compared with net income of $104.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.63 and $0.62, respectively, for the first six months of 2004 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.57 and $0.56, respectively, for the first six months of 2003. Hudson City Bancorp's annualized return on average stockholders' equity and annualized return on average assets for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 were 16.87% and 1.29%, respectively, compared with 15.64% and 1.41%, respectively, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003.
"Hudson City has once again been able to produce record earnings due to our capacity to grow our assets while controlling operating expenses," said Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. "The asset growth of nearly 10% for the year-to-date period was primarily in first mortgage loans, in keeping with our traditional thrift business model. Our anticipated asset growth and ability to control expenses should allow us to continue to generate value for our shareholders," added Mr. Hermance.
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per common share, representing an increase from the cash dividend of $0.17 per common share declared during the previous quarter. The cash dividend is payable on September 1, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 6, 2004.
Dividend Declared
To commemorate the fifth anniversary of Hudson City Bancorp's initial public offering, Ronald E. Hermance, Jr. is scheduled to open the NASDAQ National Market on July 21, 2004. "I am honored to open the NASDAQ market to celebrate the five years Hudson City has been a public company. I am equally honored to be associated with a company such as Hudson City, which has provided a total return to shareholders of over 700% during its five years of public life," said Mr. Hermance.
NASDAQ Opening Scheduled
 
Total assets increased $1.64 billion, or 9.6%, to $18.67 billion at June 30, 2004 from $17.03 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in total assets reflected a $1.25 billion increase in loans and a $537.8 million increase in investment securities.
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Hudson City Bancorp originated and purchased first mortgage loans of approximately $768.5 million and $1.59 billion, respectively, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 compared with $940.9 million and $851.4 million, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2003. Loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one- to four-family mortgage loans. The larger volume of purchased mortgage loans, when compared to originated loans, allowed us to grow and diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. Included in mortgage loan originations were refinanced mortgage loans of $87.8 million for the first six months of 2004. Modifications of existing mortgage loans during the first six months of 2004, which are not included in mortgage loan originations, amounted to $194.6 million.
The growth in investment securities reflected a $1.10 billion increase in investment securities held to maturity, partially offset by a $561.3 million decrease in investment securities available for sale due to calls during the low interest rate environment in the first quarter of 2004 and the lower fair market valuation at June 30, 2004, primarily caused by the increases in interest rates in the second quarter of 2004. Of the agency securities purchased and classified as held to maturity, $496.6 million have step-up features, where the interest rate is increased on scheduled future dates. These securities have call options that are generally effective prior to the initial rate increase but after an initial non-call period of three months to one year. The initial rate for the securities purchased was higher than interest rates on similar agency securities offered at the time of purchase without the step-up feature. The rate increases are at least one percent per adjustment and are fixed over the life of the security.
Total liabilities increased $1.68 billion, or 10.7%, to $17.38 billion at June 30, 2004 from $15.70 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in total liabilities reflected a $622.7 million increase in total deposits and a $1.05 billion increase in borrowed funds. The increase in total deposits reflected a $771.1 million increase in our interest-bearing High Value Checking account during the first six months of 2004 to $3.48 billion. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of securing $1.85 billion of new borrowings with initial reprice dates ranging from one month to four years, partially offset by calls of borrowed funds in an aggregate amount of $800.0 million.
Total stockholders' equity decreased $42.1 million, or 3.2%, to $1.29 billion at June 30, 2004 from $1.33 billion at December 31, 2003. The decrease in stockholders' equity was primarily due to repurchases of 3.3 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $115.5 million, purchases of 200,000 shares of common stock for our recognition and retention plan at an aggregate cost of $7.3 million and cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $19.5 million. As of June 30, 2004 there remained approximately 4.3 million shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. The amount of the cash dividend paid to common stockholders reflected the waiver of receipt of the dividend by Hudson City, MHC, the majority stockholder of Hudson City Bancorp. The decrease in stockholders equity also reflected a $41.6 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate available for sale investment portfolio, reflecting increases in longer term interest rates during the second quarter of 2004.
These decreases to stockholders equity were partially offset by net income of $114.6 million for the first six months of 2004, a $4.1 million increase due to the exercise of 579,834 stock options, a $13.1 million permanent tax benefit due to the exercise of stock options and a $10.1 million increase due to the
 
commitment of shares for our employee stock benefit plans. Our stockholders' equity to asset ratio at June 30, 2004 was 6.89%.
Market interest rates increased during the second quarter of 2004 following the historically low interest rate environment of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. It is anticipated that overall market interest rates will continue to increase in future periods, and that the short-term interest rates will increase faster than the long-term interest rates. If this occurs, the resulting interest rate environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations as our interest-bearing liabilities generally price off short-term interest rates, while our interest-earning assets generally price off long-term interest rates.
Statement of Income Summary
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended June 30, 2004 increased $28.1 million, or 14.6%, to $220.8 million compared with $192.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003. This increase was primarily due to a $3.00 billion, or 20.2%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $17.87 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2004 from $14.87 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2003, reflecting our planned balance sheet growth. Offsetting the effect of the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was a 24 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 4.94% for the second quarter of 2004 compared with 5.18% for the second quarter of 2003. This decrease in yield reflected the overall decrease in long-term market interest rates experienced during 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, and the continued growth of our interest-earning assets during that period.
The $27.1 million increase in interest and fees on mortgage loans was primarily due to the growth in the average balance of $2.71 billion. The $8.0 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to growth in the average balance of $850.4 million, which reflected the investment of certain of the cash flows from the high level of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets in 2003 into investment securities, and the decision to shorten the overall weighted-average life of our assets by investing in callable securities with initial call dates of three months to one year and final maturity dates of five to seven years. The $5.3 million decrease in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to a $509.5 million decrease in the average balance due to high levels of prepayment activity in 2003, sales of mortgage-backed securities, and the subsequent reinvestment of part of these proceeds into first mortgage loans or investment securities.
Total interest and dividend income for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased $42.6 million, or 10.9%, to $433.8 million compared with $391.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. This increase was primarily due to a $2.97 billion, or 20.5%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $17.49 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2004 from $14.52 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2003, reflecting our planned balance sheet growth. Offsetting the effect of the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was a 43 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 4.96% for the first six months of 2004 compared with 5.39% for the first six months of 2003. This decrease in yield reflected the overall decrease in long-term market interest rates experienced during 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, and the continued growth of our interest-earning assets during that period.
The $43.5 million increase in interest and fees on mortgage loans was primarily due to the growth in the average balance of $2.41 billion. The $21.6 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to growth in the average balance of $1.13 billion, which reflected the investment of certain of the cash flows from the high level of prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets in 2003 into investment securities, and the decision to shorten the overall weighted-average life of our assets by investing in callable securities with initial call dates of three months to one year and final
 
maturity dates of five to seven years. The $19.2 million decrease in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to a $536.4 million decrease in the average balance due to high levels of prepayment activity in 2003, sales of mortgage-backed securities, and the subsequent reinvestment of part of these proceeds into first mortgage loans or investment securities.
Total interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2004 increased $7.2 million, or 7.6%, to $101.8 million compared with $94.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003. This increase was due to a $3.01 billion, or 22.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $16.33 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2004 compared with $13.32 billion for the corresponding period in 2003. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund our growth initiatives. Partially offsetting the effect of the increase in the average balance was a 34 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 2.51% for the three-month period ended June 30, 2004 compared with 2.85% for the three-month period ended June 30, 2003. The lower annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the growth of our interest-bearing liabilities during the low interest rate environment experienced during 2003 and the first three months of 2004.
The $7.9 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing demand deposits for the three months ended June 30, 2004 was primarily due to a $1.63 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits due to the growth of our High Value Checking account product, notwithstanding a 16 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost. The $9.5 million increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $1.89 billion, notwithstanding a 70 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost. The $9.3 million decrease in interest expense on time deposits was primarily due to a decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost of 43 basis points, due to the low market interest rate environment, and a $509.8 million decrease in the average balance that we believe is primarily due to transfers from time deposits to our High Value Checking product.
Total interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased $8.8 million, or 4.6%, to $199.3 million compared with $190.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. This increase was due to a $2.96 billion, or 22.8%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $15.95 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2004 compared with $12.99 billion for the corresponding period in 2003. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund our growth initiatives. Partially offsetting the effect of the increase in the average balance was a 45 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 2.51% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 compared with 2.96% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003. The lower annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the growth of our interest-bearing liabilities during the low interest rate environment experienced during 2003 and the first three months of 2004.
The $15.3 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing demand deposits for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was primarily due to a $1.66 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits due to the growth of our High Value Checking account product, notwithstanding a 29 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost. The $16.9 million increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $1.79 billion, notwithstanding a 78 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost. The $21.2 million decrease in interest expense on time deposits was primarily due to a decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost of 52 basis points, due to the low market interest rate environment, and a $503.8 million decrease in the average balance that we believe is primarily due to transfers from time deposits to our High Value Checking product.

Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2004 increased $20.9 million, or 21.3%, to $119.0 million compared with $98.1 million for the corresponding period in 2003. The increase in net interest income reflected our growth initiatives. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets, was 2.43% for the second quarter of 2004 compared with 2.33% for the corresponding period in 2003. For the second quarter of 2004, our net interest margin, determined by dividing annualized net interest income by total average interest-earning assets, was 2.65% compared with 2.63% for the corresponding 2003 period.
Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased $33.9 million, or 16.9%, to $234.5 million compared with $200.6 million for the corresponding period in 2003. The increase in net interest income reflected our growth initiatives. Our net interest rate spread was 2.45% for the first six months of 2004 compared with 2.43% for the corresponding period in 2003. The relative stability of this ratio reflected the stable market interest rate environment during the second half of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. For the first six months of 2004, our net interest margin was 2.67% compared with 2.74% for the corresponding 2003 period. The decrease in this ratio reflects the use of funds to purchase treasury stock, which otherwise could have been invested.
The provision for loan losses was $225,000 for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, the provision for loan losses was $450,000. Net charge-offs for the first six months of 2004 were $7,000 compared with net charge-offs of $31,000 for the corresponding 2003 period. The allowance for loan losses increased $443,000 to $27.0 million at June 30, 2004 compared with $26.5 million at December 31, 2003. Non-performing loans at June 30, 2004 were $25.6 million compared with $20.3 million at December 31, 2003. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.25% at June 30, 2004 compared with 0.23% at December 31, 2003. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 105.48% at June 30, 2004 compared with 131.09% at December 31, 2003.
Total non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2004 was $3.9 million compared with $9.9 million for the corresponding 2003 period. Total non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was $7.5 million compared with $15.4 million for the corresponding 2003 period. These decreases in total non-interest income reflected decreases in gains on securities transactions, net. The cash flows from the sales of these securities were reinvested in first mortgage loans and fixed-rate securities with shorter maturities.
Total non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was $29.2 million and $24.9 million, respectively, primarily reflecting the increases in expense related to our employee stock benefit plans and staff increases. Our efficiency ratio for the three months ended June 30, 2004, determined by dividing total non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and total non-interest income, was 23.75% compared with 23.07% for the corresponding 2003 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the three months ended June 30, 2004 was 0.64% compared with 0.66% for the corresponding period in 2003.
Total non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was $58.2 million and $50.4 million, respectively, primarily reflecting the increases in expense related to our employee stock benefit plans. Our efficiency ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was 24.06% compared with 23.34% for the corresponding 2003 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was 0.65% compared with 0.68% for the corresponding period in
 
2003. Non-interest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits, net occupancy expense and other expenses.
Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2004 was $35.0 million compared with $30.3 million for the corresponding 2003 period. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was 37.50% and 36.59%, respectively. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was $68.7 million compared with $60.4 million for the corresponding 2003 period. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was 37.47% and 36.58%, respectively. These increases in income tax expense were primarily due to increases in income before income tax.
