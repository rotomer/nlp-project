FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - DECEMBER 16, 2004 CONTACT: LOUIS J. BEIERLE, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT, INVESTOR RELATIONS HUDSON CITY BANCORP, INC. WEST 80 CENTURY ROAD, PARAMUS, NEW JERSEY 07652 TELEPHONE: (201) 967-8290 E-MAIL: LJBEIERLE@HCSBNJ.COM HUDSON CITY BANCORP, INC. ANNOUNCES ADOPTION OF PLAN OF CONVERSION AND REORGANIZATION RONALD E. HERMANCE, JR. ELECTED CHAIRMAN OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS DONALD O. QUEST, M.D. DESIGNATED LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR Paramus, New Jersey, December 16, 2004 - Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ: HCBK), announced today that the Boards of Directors of the Company, its wholly owned banking subsidiary Hudson City Savings Bank (the "Bank") and its majority owner Hudson City, MHC (the "MHC") have unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the Plan, the Bank will reorganize from the two-tier mutual holding company structure to a stock holding company structure and the Company will undertake a "second-step" stock offering of new shares of common stock. The MHC, which owns approximately 65.9% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, will be merged into the Company as part of the reorganization. The Bank converted from a mutual savings bank to the two-tier holding company structure in 1999, and concurrently offered and sold a minority of the shares of the mid-tier holding company created at that time. Pursuant to the Plan, shareholders other than the MHC will receive new shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to an "exchange ratio" designed to preserve their aggregate percentage ownership interest. The exchange ratio will be determined based upon an appraisal of the Company, which is to be performed by an independent appraiser at a later date. Additionally, the shares held by the MHC will be retired and the Company will offer and sell shares of common stock in an amount representing the percentage ownership interest currently held by the MHC, also to be based on the appraisal of the Company. The shares will be offered and sold in a subscription offering to depositors and, if necessary, a syndicated offering, subject to the priorities set forth in the Plan. Depositors of the Bank as of June 30, 2003 will receive first priority. The transactions contemplated by the Plan are subject to approval of the Bank's depositors, the Company's shareholders (other than the MHC) and regulatory agencies. The prospectus, proxy statements and other offering materials setting forth detailed information relating to the Plan, details of the offering, and business and financial information about the Bank and the Company will be sent to depositors of the Bank and shareholders of the Company for their consideration early in the second quarter of 2005, but before the Company will convene depositors' and shareholders' meetings to vote on the Plan. If approved, the Company anticipates that the transactions will be completed in the second quarter of 2005. A copy of the Plan is available for inspection in the Bank's administrative offices in Paramus, NJ, and in each of the Bank's branch offices. The completion of this transaction will not affect the amount, rate or other terms of any deposit or loan account. Thacher Proffitt & Wood LLP, New York, NY, will serve as special counsel to the Company for the conversion. All appropriate financial advisors and service providers have been selected.
