RELEASE 4:15PM EST  JANUARY 18, 2005
Paramus, New Jersey, January 18, 2005 - Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today net income of $62.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of $10.2 million, or 19.5%, compared with net income of $52.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.35 and $0.34, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.29 and $0.28, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2003. Hudson City Bancorp's annualized return on average stockholders' equity and annualized return on average assets for the fourth quarter of 2004 were 17.98% and 1.27%, respectively, compared with 15.50% and 1.28%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2003.
Net income was $239.3 million for 2004, an increase of $31.9 million, or 15.4%, compared with net income of $207.4 million for 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.33 and $1.29, respectively, for 2004 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $1.14 and $1.11, respectively, for 2003. Hudson City Bancorp's return on average stockholders' equity and return on average assets for 2004 were 17.66% and 1.29%, respectively, compared with 15.38% and 1.34%, respectively, for 2003.
"Our earnings and asset growth reflect our focus on a traditional thrift business model, providing value to our customers by offering a broad range of competitively priced loan and deposit products in our longstanding and new market areas," said Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We believe our operating strategy of asset growth, earnings growth, expense control and payment of dividends has provided value to our shareholders and has also created a solid base for our organization as we look to the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead," added Mr. Hermance.
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, representing an increase from the cash dividend of $0.19 per common share declared during the previous quarter. The cash dividend is payable on March 1, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 4, 2005.
Dividend Declared
In a press release issued December 16, 2004, the Boards of Directors of Hudson City Bancorp, its wholly owned banking subsidiary Hudson City Savings Bank and its majority owner Hudson City, MHC
Plan of Conversion and Reorganization
 
announced that they unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization. Under the terms of the Plan of Conversion and Reorganization, Hudson City Savings will reorganize from its current two-tier mutual holding company structure to a stock holding company structure and Hudson City Bancorp will undertake a "second-step" stock offering of new shares of common stock. Hudson City, MHC, which owns approximately 65.9% of the outstanding common stock of Hudson City Bancorp, will be merged into Hudson City Bancorp as part of the reorganization. The transactions contemplated by the Plan of Conversion and Reorganization are subject to the approval of the Hudson City Savings' depositors, Hudson City Bancorp's shareholders (other than Hudson City, MHC) and regulatory agencies. If approved, Hudson City Bancorp anticipates that the transactions will be completed in the second quarter of 2005.
Total assets increased $3.12 billion, or 18.3%, to $20.15 billion at December 31, 2004 from $17.03 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in total assets reflected a $2.56 billion increase in loans and a $683.7 million increase in total investment securities.
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Hudson City Bancorp originated and purchased first mortgage loans of approximately $1.38 billion and $3.12 billion, respectively, for 2004 compared with $2.17 billion and $3.21 billion, respectively, for 2003. Loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one- to four-family mortgage loans. The larger volume of purchased mortgage loans, when compared to originated loans, allowed us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. Modifications of existing mortgage loans during 2004, which are not included in mortgage loan originations, amounted to $220.1 million.
The growth in investment securities reflected a $1.33 billion increase in investment securities held to maturity, partially offset by a $649.2 million decrease in investment securities available for sale due to calls of securities during 2004 and the subsequent reinvestment of part of the resulting cash flows into investment securities held to maturity. Of the agency securities purchased and classified as held to maturity, $621.6 million have step-up features, where the interest rate is increased on scheduled future dates. These securities have call options that are generally effective prior to the initial rate increase but after an initial non-call period of three months to one year. The initial rate for the securities purchased was higher than interest rates on similar agency securities offered at the time of purchase without the step-up feature. The rate increases are at least one percent per adjustment and are fixed over the life of the security. Overall, our mortgage-backed securities portfolio remained relatively stable, decreasing $46.1 million to an aggregate balance of $5.38 billion at December 31, 2004.
Total liabilities increased $3.04 billion, or 19.4%, to $18.74 billion at December 31, 2004 from $15.70 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $1.03 billion increase in total deposits and a $2.00 billion increase in borrowed funds. The increase in total deposits during 2004 primarily reflected a $1.48 billion increase in our interest-bearing High Value Checking account to a balance of $4.19 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase in borrowed funds during 2004 was the result of securing $3.75 billion of new borrowings with initial reprice dates ranging from one month to four years, partially offset by $1.75 billion of calls of borrowed funds.
Total stockholders' equity increased $73.5 million, or 5.5%, to $1.40 billion at December 31, 2004 from $1.33 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily due to net income of $239.3 million for 2004, a $6.5 million increase due to the exercise of 900,198 stock options, a $20.9 million permanent tax benefit due to the exercise of stock options and the vesting of employee stock benefit plans, and a $19.5 million increase due to the commitment of shares for our employee stock benefit plans. These increases to stockholders' equity were partially offset by repurchases of 4,590,200
 
shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $161.7 million, purchases of 200,000 shares of common stock for our recognition and retention plan at an aggregate cost of $7.3 million, cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $40.5 million and a $3.1 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment portfolio.
As of December 31, 2004 there remained 3,076,221 shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. The decrease from prior years in the amount of the cash dividends paid to common stockholders reflected the waiver in 2004 of receipt of the dividend by Hudson City, MHC, the majority stockholder of Hudson City Bancorp. Our stockholders' equity to asset ratio at December 31, 2004 was 6.96%.
Short-term market interest rates generally increased throughout the entirety of 2004, primarily during the last three quarters of 2004. The rates we paid on our deposit products, which are generally tied to short-term market rates, also increased during 2004. Overall, during 2004, long-term market interest rates slightly decreased, notwithstanding an increase in long-term market interest rates during the second quarter of 2004. The rates we earned on our originated mortgage loans, which are generally tied to long-term market rates, also decreased overall during 2004, notwithstanding an increase during the second quarter of 2004. This general increase in short-term interest rates, in conjunction with the slight decrease in long-term interest rates, has flattened the market yield curve.
Statement of Income Summary
It is anticipated short-term market interest rates will continue to increase in 2005, and long-term market interest rates will begin to increase, but not as fast as short-term interest rates. The result of this potential market interest rate scenario would be a further flattening of the market yield curve, which would cause the spread between long-term interest rates and short-term interest rates to decrease. If this occurs, the resulting interest rate environment is expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations as our interest-bearing liabilities, both deposits and borrowed funds, generally price off short-term interest rates, while our interest-earning assets, both mortgage loans and securities, generally price off long-term interest rates. If both short- and long-term interest rates increase by the same amount, and the shape of the yield curve does not change, the resulting environment is also likely to have a negative impact on our results of operations, as our interest-bearing liabilities will reset to the current market interest rate faster than our interest-earning assets
.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended December 31, 2004 increased $47.5 million, or 23.8%, to $247.0 million compared with $199.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to a $3.25 billion, or 20.2%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $19.35 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2004 from $16.10 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2003, reflecting our planned balance sheet growth. Also contributing to the growth in interest and dividend income was a 16 basis point increase in the annualized weighted average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 5.11% for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with 4.95% for the fourth quarter of 2003. This increase in yield reflected the growth of our loan portfolio during 2004, which earns an interest rate higher than the total interest-earning asset portfolio. The increase in yield also reflected the lower dollar amount of net premium amortization in the fourth quarter of 2004 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2003.
The $40.7 million increase in interest and fees on mortgage loans was due to the growth in the average balance of $3.02 billion. The $7.6 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to growth in the average balance of $642.7 million, which reflected the investment of certain of the cash flows from prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets into investment
 
securities, consistent with the decision to shorten the overall weighted-average life of our interest-earning assets by investing in callable investment securities with initial call dates of three months to one year and final maturity dates of five to seven years. The $2.2 million decrease in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to a $452.4 million decrease in the average balance due to prepayment activity and sales of mortgage-backed securities, and the subsequent reinvestment of part of these proceeds into first mortgage loans or investment securities.
Total interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $137.8 million, or 17.7%, to $915.1 million compared with $777.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to a $3.12 billion, or 20.6%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $18.25 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $15.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, reflecting our balance sheet growth. Offsetting the effect of the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was a 13 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 5.01% for 2004 compared with 5.14% for 2003. This decrease in yield reflected the overall decrease in long-term market interest rates experienced during 2003 and the slight increase of long-term interest rates during 2004, and the continued growth of our interest-earning assets during those periods.
The $125.6 million increase in interest and fees on mortgage loans was primarily due to the growth in the average balance of $2.79 billion. The $39.2 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to growth in the average balance of $938.0 million, which reflected the investment of certain of the cash flows from prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets into investment securities, consistent with the decision to shorten the overall weighted-average life of our interest-earning assets by investing in callable investment securities with initial call dates of three months to one year and final maturity dates of five to seven years. The $25.9 million decrease in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to a $568.9 million decrease in the average balance due to prepayment activity and sales of mortgage-backed securities, and the subsequent reinvestment of part of these proceeds into first mortgage loans or investment securities.
Total interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2004 increased $26.7 million, or 28.5%, to $120.5 million compared with $93.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. This increase was partially due to a $3.21 billion, or 22.1%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $17.75 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2004 compared with $14.54 billion for the corresponding period in 2003. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities was used to fund our asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 14 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 2.70% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2004 compared with 2.56% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2003, which reflected the growth of our interest-bearing liabilities during the rising short-term interest rate environment experienced during 2004.
The $11.5 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing demand deposits for the three months ended December 31, 2004 was due to a $1.49 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits due to the growth of our High Value Checking account product, and a 35 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost due to rising short-term interest rates experienced during 2004. The $16.8 million increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $2.20 billion, notwithstanding a 24 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost of borrowed funds. This decline in the weighted average cost was due to the placement of new borrowings during the low market interest rate environment of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. The $1.5 million decrease in interest expense on time deposits was due to a $417.8
 
million decrease in the average balance that we believe was primarily due to transfers from time deposits to our High Value Checking product.
Total interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $53.7 million, or 14.3%, to $430.1 million compared with $376.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was due to a $3.11 billion, or 22.9%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $16.69 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $13.58 billion for the corresponding period in 2003. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund our growth. Partially offsetting the effect of the increase in the average balance was a 19 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 2.58% for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with 2.77% for 2003. The lower weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the growth of our interest-bearing liabilities during the low interest rate environment experienced during 2003 and the first three months of 2004.
The $36.3 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing demand deposits for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to a $1.61 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits due to the growth of our High Value Checking account product. The $48.3 million increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $2.01 billion, notwithstanding a 55 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds. The $28.3 million decrease in interest expense on time deposits was primarily due to a 29 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of such deposits, due to the continued low short-term interest rate environment, notwithstanding the short-term interest rate increases during the last three quarters of 2004, and a $487.9 million decrease in the average balance that we believe is primarily due to transfers from time deposits to our High Value Checking product.
Net interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2004 increased $20.9 million, or 19.8%, to $126.5 million compared with $105.6 million for the corresponding period in 2003. The increase in net interest income reflected, in part, our overall balance sheet growth. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets, was 2.41% for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with 2.39% for the corresponding period in 2003. For the fourth quarter of 2004, our net interest margin, determined by dividing annualized net interest income by total average interest-earning assets, was 2.63% compared with 2.64% for the corresponding 2003 period. Net interest income for the year ended December 30, 2004 increased $84.0 million, or 20.9%, to $485.0 million compared with $401.0 million for the corresponding period in 2003 reflecting, in part, our overall balance sheet growth. Our net interest rate spread was 2.43% for 2004 compared with 2.37% for 2003. For 2004, our net interest margin was 2.66% compared with 2.65% for 2003.
The provision for loan losses was $115,000 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2004 compared to $225,000 for the three-month period ended December 31,2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the provision for loan losses was $790,000 compared to $900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net charge-offs for 2004 were $18,000 compared with net recoveries of $146,000 for 2003. The allowance for loan losses increased $772,000 to $27.3 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $26.5 million at December 31, 2003. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.24% at December 31, 2004 compared with 0.30% at December 31, 2003.
Non-performing loans at December 31, 2004 were $21.6 million compared with $20.3 million at December 31, 2003. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.19% at December 31, 2004 compared with 0.23% at December 31, 2003. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 126.44% at December 31, 2004 compared with 131.09% at December 31, 2003.
 
Total non-interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2004 was $4.1 million compared with $4.8 million for the corresponding 2003 period. Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $16.6 million compared with $29.7 million for the corresponding 2003 period. These decreases in total non-interest income reflected decreases in gains on securities transactions, net, due to enhanced opportunities to realize gains during 2003 due to a declining interest rate environment. The cash flows from the sales of these securities were reinvested in first mortgage loans and fixed-rate securities with shorter maturities.
Total non-interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $31.2 million and $26.5 million, respectively, which primarily reflected the increases in compensation expense related to staff increases due to our branch expansion program and expenses related to internal control evaluation and testing in order to comply with the new certification requirements imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations. Our efficiency ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2004, determined by dividing total non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and total non-interest income, was 23.90% compared with 23.97% for the corresponding 2003 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the three months ended December 31, 2004 was 0.63% compared with 0.65% for the corresponding period in 2003.
Total non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $118.3 million and $102.5 million, respectively, which primarily reflected increases in employee benefit expense related to our employee stock benefit plans, compensation expense related to staff increases due to our branch expansion program, and expenses related to internal control evaluation and testing in order to comply with the new certification requirements imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations. Our efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 23.60% compared with 23.81% for the corresponding 2003 period. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 0.64% compared with 0.66% for the corresponding period in 2003. Non-interest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits, net occupancy expense and other expenses.
Income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2004 was $36.7 million compared with $31.4 million for the corresponding 2003 period. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was 36.96% and 37.44%, respectively. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $143.1 million compared with $119.8 million for the corresponding 2003 period. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was 37.43% and 36.61%, respectively. These increases in the amount of income tax expense were primarily due to increases in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2004 when compared to 2003 was primarily due to the expense of the employee stock ownership plan, which is not fully deductible for income tax purposes.
