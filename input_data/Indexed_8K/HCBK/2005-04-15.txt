Exhibit 99.1
Paramus, New Jersey, April 14, 2005  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today net income of $61.9 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of $5.7 million, or 10.1%, compared with net income of $56.2 million for the first quarter of 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.35 and $0.34, respectively, for the first quarter of 2005 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.31 and $0.30, respectively, for the first quarter of 2004. Hudson City Bancorp's annualized return on average stockholders' equity and annualized return on average assets for the first quarter of 2005 were 17.21% and 1.21%, respectively, compared with 16.75% and 1.29%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2004.
"We have again reported strong quarterly earnings due to our continued ability to grow our assets while controlling operating expenses, despite the pressure on the net interest margin due to the flattening of the yield curve" said Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This asset growth, primarily in first mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, reflects our focus on a traditional thrift business model, where we believe we can provide value to both our customers, through competitively priced products, and our shareholders, through continued increases in earnings and dividends," added Mr. Hermance.
Dividend Declared
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share, representing an increase from the cash dividend of $0.20 per common share declared during the previous quarter. The cash dividend is payable on June 1, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005.
Plan of Conversion and Reorganization
In a press release issued December 16, 2004, the Boards of Directors of Hudson City Bancorp, its wholly owned banking subsidiary Hudson City Savings Bank and its majority owner Hudson City, MHC announced that they unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization. Under the terms of the Plan of Conversion and Reorganization, Hudson City Savings will reorganize from its current two-tier mutual holding company structure to a stock holding company structure and Hudson City Bancorp will undertake a "second-step" stock offering of new shares of common stock. Hudson City, MHC, which owns approximately 65.76% of the outstanding common stock of Hudson City Bancorp as of March 31, 2005, will be merged into Hudson City Bancorp as part of the reorganization. In a press release dated April 5, 2005, Hudson City Bancorp announced receipt of conditional approval from the Office of Thrift Supervision to commence the "second-step" transaction and that the registration statement related to the transaction was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The transactions contemplated by the Plan of Conversion and Reorganization are still subject to the approval of Hudson City Savings' depositors and Hudson City Bancorp's shareholders (other than Hudson City, MHC) and the sale of at least 361.3 million shares of common stock. If approved, Hudson City Bancorp anticipates that the transactions will be completed in the second quarter of 2005.
 
Date Set For Stockholder and Depositor Meetings
The Board of Directors of Hudson City Bancorp has scheduled May 27, 2005 as the date of its 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The record date for stockholders eligible to vote at the meeting was April 8, 2005. The Board of Directors of Hudson City, MHC, has scheduled May 27, 2005 as the date of the special meeting of its members (depositors of Hudson City Savings are considered members of Hudson City, MHC) to vote on the Plan of Conversion and Reorganization. The record date for members eligible to vote at the meeting was March 31, 2005.
Dividend Waiver
During the first quarter of 2005, Hudson City, MHC, the majority owner of Hudson City Bancorp common stock, applied for and received regulatory approval to waive receipt of dividend payments on the Hudson City Bancorp stock it owns. This waiver applies to any dividend declared during 2005. The additional operating capital remaining at Hudson City Bancorp will be used for general corporate purposes.
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $985.2 million, or 4.9%, to $21.13 billion at March 31, 2005 from $20.15 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase in total assets reflected a $620.8 million increase in loans and a $328.3 million increase in total mortgage-backed securities.
Hudson City Bancorp originated and purchased first mortgage loans of approximately $322.7 million and $785.6 million, respectively, during the first quarter of 2005 compared with $247.3 million and $761.1 million, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2004. Of the first mortgage loans originated and purchased during the first quarter of 2005, approximately 40.5% were variable-rate loans. Loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one- to four-family mortgage loans. Purchased mortgage loans allow us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model.
The growth in mortgage-backed securities resulted from a $169.5 million increase in mortgage-backed securities held to maturity, primarily reflected purchases of variable-rate instruments, and a $158.8 million increase in mortgage-backed securities available for sale, also reflected purchases of only variable-rate instruments. Overall, our investment securities portfolio remained relatively stable, increasing $41.3 million to an aggregate balance of $2.97 billion at March 31, 2005.
Total liabilities increased $948.0 million, or 5.1%, to $19.69 billion at March 31, 2005 from $18.74 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $700.0 million increase in borrowed funds and a $218.9 million increase in total deposits. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of securing $700.0 million of new borrowings, primarily with initial reprice dates ranging from three to five years and final maturities of ten years. Of these new borrowings, $600.0 million were pursuant to reverse repurchase agreements and $100.0 million were advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The increase in total deposits during the first quarter of 2005 primarily reflected a $139.3 million increase in time deposits to an aggregate balance of $5.41 billion at March 31, 2005 and a $53.5 million increase in our interest-bearing High Value Checking account to a balance of $4.34 billion at March 31, 2005.
Total stockholders' equity increased $37.2 million, or 2.7%, to $1.44 billion at March 31, 2005 from $1.40 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily due to net income of $61.9 million for the first three months of 2005, a $1.9 million increase due to the exercise of 260,698 stock options, a $3.9 million permanent tax benefit due to the exercise of stock options and the vesting of
 
employee stock benefit plans, and a $4.3 million increase due to the commitment of shares for our employee stock benefit plans. These increases to stockholders' equity were partially offset by cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $11.3 million, purchases of 36,134 shares of common stock for our recognition and retention plan at an aggregate cost of $1.3 million and a $22.1 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment portfolio due to increasing market interest rates.
As of March 31, 2005 there remained 3,076,221 shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. We have suspended our stock repurchase program pending the completion of the "second-step" conversion. At March 31, 2005, our stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 6.81%, our year-to-date average stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 7.01%, and our stockholders' equity per common share was $8.04.
Statement of Income Summary
Short-term market interest rates continued to increase in the first quarter of 2005, following increases throughout the entirety of 2004. Long-term market interest rates also increased in the first quarter of 2005, but at a slower pace than short-term interest rates. Hence, the market yield curve continued to flatten in the first quarter of 2005. Accordingly, our net interest margin decreased 24 basis points for the first three months of 2005 compared with the same period in 2004, as our interest income, in general, reflects movements in long-term rates while our interest expense, in general, reflects movements in short-term rates. However, the $10.4 million, or 9.0%, increase in the first quarter of 2005 in our net interest income, when compared to the corresponding three-month period in 2004, reflects the approximate 18% growth in our total average interest-earning assets.
We anticipate that both short-term and long-term market interest rates will continue to increase in 2005, but short-term interest rates will continue to increase at a faster pace than long-term market rates. The result of this potential market interest rate scenario would be a further flattening of the market yield curve, which would cause the spread between long-term interest rates and short-term interest rates to decrease. If this occurs, the resulting interest rate environment is expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations as our interest-bearing deposits generally price based on short-term interest rates, while our interest-earning assets, both mortgage loans and securities, generally price based on long-term interest rates. If both short- and long-term interest rates increase by the same amount, and the shape of the yield curve does not change, the resulting environment is also likely to have a short-term negative impact on our results of operations, as our interest-bearing liabilities will reset to the current market interest rates faster than our interest-earning assets
.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2005 increased $40.6 million, or 19.1%, to $253.6 million compared with $213.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to a $3.12 billion, or 18.2%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $20.23 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2005 from $17.11 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2004, reflecting our balance sheet growth. Also contributing to the growth in interest and dividend income was a four basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 5.02% for the first quarter of 2005 compared with 4.98% for the first quarter of 2004. This increase in yield was primarily the result of a shift in our interest-earning asset mix to a higher percentage of first mortgage loans, which earn a higher yield than most of our other interest-earning assets.
The $33.0 million increase in interest and fees on mortgage loans was due to the growth in the average balance of $2.53 billion, notwithstanding an eight basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average yield. The $7.7 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due
 
to growth in the average balance of $659.6 million, which reflected the investment during 2004 of certain of the cash flows from prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets into investment securities. The $1.4 million decrease in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to an $85.3 million decrease in the average balance due to prepayment activity and sales of mortgage-backed securities, and the subsequent reinvestment of part of these proceeds into first mortgage loans or investment securities. The decrease also reflected a four basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average yield of mortgage-backed securities.
Total interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2005 increased $30.2 million, or 31.0%, to $127.7 million compared with $97.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004. This increase was partially due to a $2.97 billion, or 19.1%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $18.54 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2005 compared with $15.57 billion for the corresponding period in 2004. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities funded our asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 27 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 2.79% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2005 compared with 2.52% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2004, which reflected the growth of our interest-bearing liabilities during the rising short-term interest rate environment experienced during 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 and the larger growth in our borrowed funds, which have higher costs than our interest-bearing deposits.
The $17.1 million increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $2.02 billion, notwithstanding a two- basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost of borrowed funds. The $13.1 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was due to a $937.9 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and a 33 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost due to rising short-term interest rates experienced during 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. The $11.7 million increase in interest expense on our interest-bearing demand accounts reflected an increase in the average balance of $1.33 billion, primarily due to the growth of our High Value Checking account product, and a 46 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost due to the rising short-term market interest rate environment.
Net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2005 increased $10.4 million, or 9.0%, to $125.9 million compared with $115.5 million for the corresponding period in 2004. The increase in net interest income reflected, in part, our overall balance sheet growth. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets, was 2.23% for the first quarter of 2005 compared with 2.46% for the corresponding period in 2004. For the first quarter of 2005, our net interest margin, determined by dividing annualized net interest income by total average interest-earning assets, was 2.45% compared with 2.69% for the corresponding 2004 period. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to the larger increase in the weighted-average cost of interest-bearing liabilities when compared to the weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets.
The provision for loan losses was $65,000 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2005 compared to $225,000 for the three-month period ended March 31,2004. Net recoveries for the first quarter of 2005 were $4,000 compared with net charge-offs of $7,000 for the first quarter of 2004. The allowance for loan losses increased $69,000 to $27.4 million at March 31, 2005 compared with $27.3 million at December 31, 2004. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.23% at March 31, 2005 compared with 0.24% at December 31, 2004. Non-performing loans at March 31, 2005 were $24.5 million compared with $21.6 million at December 31, 2004. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.20% at March 31, 2005 compared with 0.19% at December 31, 2004. The ratio of allowance
 
for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 111.83% at March 31, 2005 compared with 126.44% at December 31, 2004.
Total non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was $3.9 million compared with $3.6 million for the corresponding 2004 period. This increase in total non-interest income reflected a $300,000 increase in gains on securities transactions, net. The cash flows from the sales of these securities were primarily reinvested in first mortgage loans.
Total non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 was $30.8 million and $29.1 million, respectively, which primarily reflected increases in net occupancy expense and advertising expenses (a component of other expenses) due to our branch expansion program. Our efficiency ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2005, determined by dividing total non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and total non-interest income, was 23.71% compared with 24.38% for the corresponding 2004 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was 0.60% compared with 0.67% for the corresponding period in 2004.
Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was $37.0 million compared with $33.7 million for the corresponding 2004 period. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 was 37.40% and 37.45%, respectively. The increase in the amount of income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in income before income tax.
