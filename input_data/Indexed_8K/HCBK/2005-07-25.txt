Items  1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 1, 2005, Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an agreement with the independent trustee of the Hudson City Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP"), which provides a commitment by the Company to lend funds to allow the trustee to purchase up to 15,719,223 shares of Hudson City Bancorp common stock (the "Common Stock") on the open market. The loan is secured by the shares of Common Stock purchased by the ESOP.
The ESOP will repay the loan in annual installments over a forty-year period. The shares of Common Stock purchased by the ESOP will be allocated to employees over the forty-year period of the loan. Concurrently, the outstanding loan to the ESOP that was made in 1999 was renegotiated to provide for repayment in annual installments over the same period as the new loan.
