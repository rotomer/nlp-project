RELEASE 4:00AM  OCTOBER 19, 2005
Paramus, New Jersey, October 19, 2005  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today the results of its operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005.
Financial Highlights
 
"We continue to see balance sheet growth as the key to our future economic success, particularly in this challenging interest rate environment," said Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The capital we acquired from our highly successful second-step conversion and stock offering will allow us to maintain this growth strategy, which we anticipate will be funded by borrowed funds and customer deposits. In keeping with our thrift business model, we intend the asset growth to be primarily through the origination and purchase of traditional fixed- and variable-rate first mortgage loans. We believe this growth strategy and our attention to efficient operation, even in this market interest rate environment, will provide value to our shareholders through continued earnings and payment of dividends," added Mr. Hermance.
 
Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which, in part, is a direct result of the market interest rate environment. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, primarily mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by the shape of the market yield curve, the timing of the placement and repricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, and the prepayment rate on our mortgage-related assets. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Our results are also affected by the market price of our stock, as the expense of certain of our employee stock compensation plans is related to the current price of our common stock.
Statement of Income Summary
For both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005, our growth in interest income was derived from the overall growth in our balance sheet, while the increase in interest expense reflected the growth in our interest-bearing liabilities and increases in the prevailing interest rate environment. Short-term market interest rates generally increased during the first nine months of 2005 following increases during the entirety of 2004. The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank ("FOMC") increased the overnight lending rate 25 basis points at each of the regularly scheduled meetings beginning in June 2004 to the current rate of 3.75%. Intermediate-term market interest rates, those with maturities of two to five years, and long-term market interest rates, in particular the 10- and 30- year bonds, also increased during the first nine months of 2005, but at a slower pace than short-term interest rates. The result of these market interest rate changes was a continued flattening of the market yield curve during the first nine months of 2005.
In this rate environment, our net interest margin decreased 30 basis points when comparing the third quarter of 2005 with the same period in 2004 and 29 basis points when comparing the first nine months of 2005 to the first nine months of 2004, as our interest income, in general, reflects movements in long-term rates while our interest expense, in general, reflects movements in short-term rates. The $28.2 million increase in the third quarter of 2005 and the $51.2 million increase during the first nine months of 2005 in our net interest income, when compared to the same periods in 2004, reflects the 38.7% and 27.9% growth, respectively, in the average balance of our total interest-earning assets over the prior year periods, as compared to the growth in the average balance of our total interest-bearing liabilities of 18.3% and 20.0%, over those same periods. This difference in growth rates offset the negative impact of the flattening market yield curve.
We anticipate that short-term interest rates will continue to increase through the remainder of 2005 and into 2006, as it is anticipated the FOMC will continue to increase the Fed funds rate at its current measured pace, and long-term interest rates will increase at a similar rate, thus maintaining the flat market yield curve. The result of this potential market interest rate scenario would have a negative impact on our results of operations and our net interest margin as our interest-earning assets, both loans and securities, generally price off long-term interest rates, while our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits, generally price off short-term interest rates. Additionally, the cost on both deposits and borrowed funds will reset to the current market interest rates faster than the change to our interest-earning assets.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended September 30, 2005 increased $79.5 million, or 33.9%, to $313.8 million compared with $234.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004. This increase was primarily due to a $7.21 billion, or 38.7%, increase in the average balance of
 
interest-earning assets to $25.86 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2005 from $18.65 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2004, reflecting our internally generated balance sheet growth and the investment of the net proceeds from the second-step conversion and stock offering. The increase in interest and dividend income due to the growth in average interest-earning assets was partially offset by a 17 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 4.85% for the third quarter of 2005 compared with 5.02% for the third quarter of 2004. This decrease in yield was primarily the result of a shift in our interest-earning asset mix to shorter-term investment securities to help manage our interest rate risk. More specifically, part of the proceeds from our second-step conversion and stock offering were invested into agency discount notes with maturities ranging from one to six months.
The $39.2 million increase in interest and fees on mortgage loans was due to the growth in the average balance of $3.04 billion. The $25.9 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to growth in the average balance of $2.81 billion, which reflected the investment during 2004 of certain of the cash flows from prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets into investment securities and the investment of part of the net proceeds from the second-step conversion and stock offering. The $12.3 million increase in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to a $1.32 billion increase in the average balance reflecting increased purchases of adjustable-rate securities during the first nine months of 2005 and the investment of part of the net proceeds from the second-step offering.
Total interest and dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased $178.5 million, or 26.7%, to $846.6 million compared with $668.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. This increase was primarily due to a $4.99 billion, or 27.9%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $22.87 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 from $17.88 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, reflecting our balance sheet growth and the investment of the net proceeds from the second-step conversion and stock offering. The increase in interest and dividend income due to the growth in average interest-earning assets was partially offset by a 5 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 4.93% for the first nine months of 2005 compared with 4.98% for the first nine months of 2004. This decrease in yield was primarily the result of a shift in our interest-earning asset mix to shorter-term investment securities.
The $110.8 million increase in interest and fees on mortgage loans was due to the growth in the average balance of $2.82 billion. The $45.2 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to growth in the average balance of $1.56 billion, which reflected the investment during 2004 of certain of the cash flows from prepayment activity on our mortgage-related assets into investment securities and the investment of part of the net offering proceeds from the second-step conversion and stock offering. The $14.6 million increase in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to a $554.3 million increase in the average balance due to the investment of part of the net offering proceeds from the second-step conversion and stock offering.
Total interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2005 increased $51.3 million, or 46.5%, to $161.6 million compared with $110.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004. This increase was partially due to a $3.12 billion, or 18.3%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $20.20 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared with $17.08 billion for the corresponding period in 2004. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities funded a portion of our asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 60 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 3.17% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2005 compared with 2.57% for the three-month period
 
ended September 30, 2004, which reflected the growth and repricing of our interest-bearing liabilities during the rising short-term interest rate environment experienced during 2004 and the first nine months of 2005.
The $29.2 million increase in interest expense on borrowed funds for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $2.97 billion, which was primarily used to fund loan growth, and an 11 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost. The $22.1 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was due to a $152.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and a 78 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost due to rising short-term interest rates experienced during 2004 and the first nine months of 2005.
Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased $127.3 million, or 41.1% to $436.9 million compared with $309.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. This increase was partially due to a $3.27 billion, or 20.0%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $19.60 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 compared with $16.33 billion for the corresponding period in 2004. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities funded a portion of our asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 45 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 2.98% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 compared with 2.53% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004, which reflected the growth and repricing of our interest-bearing liabilities during the rising short-term interest rate environment experienced during 2004 and the first nine months of 2005.
The $72.4 million increase in interest expense on borrowed funds for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was due to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $2.58 billion and a 7 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost. The $54.8 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was due to a $696.4 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and a 54 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost due to rising short-term interest rates experienced during 2004 and the first nine months of 2005.
Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2005 increased $28.2 million, or 22.7%, to $152.2 million compared with $124.0 million for the corresponding period in 2004. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets, was 1.68% for the third quarter of 2005 compared with 2.45% for the corresponding period in 2004. For the third quarter of 2005, our net interest margin, determined by dividing annualized net interest income by total average interest-earning assets, was 2.37% compared with 2.67% for the corresponding 2004 period. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased $51.2 million, or 14.3%, to $409.7 million compared with $358.5 million for the corresponding period in 2004. Our net interest rate spread was 1.95% for the first nine months of 2005 compared with 2.45% for the corresponding period in 2004. For the first nine months of 2005, our net interest margin was 2.38% compared with 2.67% for the corresponding 2004 period.
The increase in our net interest income in both the three- and nine-month periods reflected, in part, our overall internally generated balance sheet growth and the investment of the net proceeds from the second-step conversion and stock offering, partially offset by the increase in the costs of our deposits and borrowed funds. The decrease in the net interest rate spread and net interest margin was primarily due to the increase in the weighted-average cost of interest-bearing liabilities and the decrease in the weighted-average yield on our interest-earning assets. The increase in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities
 
reflected the rising short-term interest rate environment and the borrowing of funds with longer terms to initial reprice or maturity than in previous periods. The decrease in the yield on our interest-earning assets reflected the shift in our investment portfolio to shorter-term interest-earning assets; by purchasing and originating a larger percentage of adjustable-rate instruments and purchasing agency discount notes with part of the proceeds from our second-step conversion and stock offering.
We did not provide for the allowance for loan losses during the three-month period ended September 30, 2005, however, we provided $225,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2004. The provision for loan losses was $65,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 compared to $675,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004. Net recoveries for the first nine months of 2005 were $8,000 compared with net charge-offs of $12,000 for the corresponding 2004 period. The allowance for loan losses increased $73,000 to $27.4 million at September 30, 2005 compared with $27.3 million at December 31, 2004. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.20% at September 30, 2005 compared with 0.24% at December 31, 2004. Non-performing loans at September 30, 2005 were $15.6 million compared with $21.6 million at December 31, 2004. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.11% at September 30, 2005 compared with 0.19% at December 31, 2004. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 175.98% at September 30, 2005 compared with 126.44% at December 31, 2004.
Total non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was $1.4 million compared with $4.9 million for the corresponding 2004 period. Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $6.5 million compared with $12.4 million for the corresponding 2004 period. These decreases in total non-interest income reflected decreases in gains on securities transactions, net, as no sales of securities occurred during the second or third quarters of 2005.
Total non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 was $32.9 million and $28.9 million, respectively, which primarily reflected increases in net occupancy expense and employee compensation. Our efficiency ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2005, determined by dividing total non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and total non-interest income, was 21.44% compared with 22.42% for the corresponding 2004 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was 0.50% compared with 0.61% for the corresponding period in 2004.
Total non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 was $93.9 million and $87.1 million, respectively, which primarily reflected increases in net occupancy expense and employee compensation. Our efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was 22.57% compared with 23.49% for the corresponding 2004 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was 0.54% compared with 0.64% for the corresponding period in 2004.
Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was $45.6 million compared with $37.7 million for the corresponding 2004 period. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 was 37.82% and 37.83%, respectively. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $121.0 million compared with $106.4 million for the corresponding 2004 period. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 was 37.55% and 37.60%, respectively. These increases in the amount of income tax expense were primarily due to increases in income before income tax.
 
Total assets increased $6.40 billion, or 31.8%, to $26.55 billion at September 30, 2005 from $20.15 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to the receipt of the $3.80 billion of net offering proceeds from our second-step conversion and stock offering, as well as our internally generated growth. The increase in total assets reflected a $2.55 billion increase in total investment securities; a $2.46 billion increase in loans and a $1.34 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities.
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
The net $3.80 billion increase to stockholders' equity due to the conversion reflected the receipt of the $3.93 billion offering proceeds less the payment of $125.0 million in conversion related expenses. Equity was further increased by $145.8 million due to the consolidation of Hudson City, MHC into Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. The amount of funds available for investment from the net offering proceeds was $3.57 billion, reflecting a further $229.9 million reduction from the net offering proceeds due to the use of customer deposits to purchase stock. Of this amount, and reflected in the increase in investment securities, approximately $1.50 billion was invested into government-sponsored agency discount notes, approximately $900.0 million was invested into government-sponsored agency securities and approximately $400.0 million was invested into government-sponsored agency step-up notes. Hudson City Bancorp contributed $3.0 billion of the net proceeds to Hudson City Savings Bank.
We purchased and originated first mortgage loans of approximately $2.62 billion and $1.45 billion, respectively, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 compared with $2.36 billion and $1.11 billion, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2004. Of the first mortgage loans originated and purchased during the first nine months of 2005, approximately 42.10% were variable-rate loans. Loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one- to four-family mortgage loans. Purchased mortgage loans allow us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. At September 30, 2005, we are committed to purchase and originate $588.6 million and $292.3 million, respectively, of first mortgage loans, which are expected to settle during the fourth quarter of 2005.
Total mortgage-backed securities increased $1.34 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005, reflecting purchases of approximately $2.68 billion. Of the mortgage-backed securities purchased, approximately 92.11% were adjustable-rate or hybrid instruments. All of our mortgage-backed securities are directly or indirectly insured or guaranteed by a government or government-sponsored agency. At September 30, 2005, we are committed to purchase $326.0 million of when-issued mortgage-backed securities, which are expected to settle during the fourth quarter of 2005.
Total liabilities increased $2.52 billion, or 13.4%, to $21.26 billion at September 30, 2005 from $18.74 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $2.60 billion increase in borrowed funds, partially offset by a $95.9 million decrease in deposits. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of securing $2.7 billion of new borrowings with initial reprice dates ranging from three to five years and final maturities of ten years. Of total borrowed funds, $7.10 billion are pursuant to reverse repurchase agreements and $2.65 billion are advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Total deposits decreased $95.9 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005, but increased $117.3 million during the three-month period from June 30, 2005 to September 30, 2005. The year-to-date decrease reflected the consolidation of the $145.8 million deposit of Hudson City, MHC, which was added to our capital, and the use of approximately $229.9 million of customer deposits to purchase stock during our second-step stock offering.
We plan to grow our assets during the remainder of 2005 and into 2006 primarily through the origination and purchase of mortgage loans, while purchasing investment and mortgage-backed securities as a
 
supplement to our investments in mortgage loans. During the third quarter of 2005, total loans increased $727.6 million, mortgage-backed securities increased $172.9 million, and investment securities decreased $397.2 million. The decrease in investment securities reflected the maturity of certain of the discount notes purchased with the proceeds from the second-step conversion. We also plan that approximately half of these originations and purchases will be short-term or variable-rate in nature, in order to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. We consider a loan or security to be variable rate if there exists a contractual rate adjustment during the life of the instrument, including those variable-rate mortgage-related assets with three-, five- or ten-year initial fixed-rate periods.
The primary funding for our asset growth is expected to come from customer deposits and borrowed funds. During the third quarter of 2005, total deposits increased $117.3 million and borrowed funds increased $600.0 million. We plan that the funds borrowed will primarily have initial non-call periods of three to five years and final maturities of ten years in order to extend the maturity of our liabilities and assist in the management of our interest rate risk. We intend to grow customer deposits by continuing to offer desirable products at competitive rates and by opening new branch offices. We opened two branch offices in Suffolk County, NY and two branch offices in Richmond County (Staten Island), NY during the first nine months of 2005. In early October of 2005, we opened one additional branch office in Suffolk County. We will continue to explore branch expansion opportunities in market areas that present significant opportunities for our traditional thrift business model and intend to open ten to fifteen branches annually.
Total stockholders' equity increased $3.89 billion to $5.29 billion at September 30, 2005 from $1.40 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily due to the net offering proceeds of $3.80 billion, a $145.8 million increase due to the consolidation of Hudson City, MHC into Hudson City Bancorp, and net income of $201.3 million for the first nine months of 2005. Also increasing stockholders' equity was a $2.5 million increase due to the exercise of stock options, an $8.8 million permanent tax benefit due to the exercise of stock options and the vesting of employee stock benefit plans, and a $9.7 million increase due to the commitment of shares for our employee stock benefit plans. These increases to stockholders' equity were partially offset by cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $63.1 million, purchases of 15,719,223 shares for our employee stock ownership plan at an aggregate cost of $189.3 million, purchases of shares of common stock for our recognition and retention plan at an aggregate cost of $1.3 million, a $2.7 million purchase of treasury stock directly from vesting shares in our recognition and retention plan for payment of income taxes and a $33.1 million further decrease in our accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily due to higher market interest rates decreasing the market value of our available for sale portfolio.
A sixth stock repurchase plan has been approved to repurchase up to 29,880,000 shares, or approximately five percent of the outstanding common stock. The fifth repurchase plan was terminated upon approval of the sixth plan. At September 30, 2005, our stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 19.92% and our year-to-date average stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 13.42%. At September 30, 2005, our stockholders' equity per common share, using the period-end share count of outstanding shares, less purchased but unallocated employee stock ownership plan shares and less purchased but unvested management plan shares, was $9.46.
