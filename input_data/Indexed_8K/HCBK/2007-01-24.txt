RELEASE 8:00AM  JANUARY 24, 2007
Paramus, New Jersey, January 24, 2007  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today the results of its operations for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2006.
Financial Highlights
 
"The interest rate environment continued to exert downward pressure on our net interest margin and interest rate spread during the fourth quarter of 2006," said Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Despite the inverted yield curve, we were able to grow assets by over $7 billion, successfully complete the acquisition of Sound Federal, and maintain a favorable total return for our shareholders. We plan to continue our strategy of focused balance sheet growth, repurchase of stock, and development of our newly entered markets as we head into 2007. With our experienced management team and strong capital base in place, we are well prepared for the challenges which lie ahead."
Statement of Income Summary
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended December 31, 2006 increased $116.7 million, or 35.1%, to $449.0 million compared with $332.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to a $7.05 billion, or 26.2%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $33.94 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2006 from $26.89 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest and dividend income was also due to a 35 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 5.29% for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with 4.94% for the fourth quarter of 2005.
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $64.3 million primarily due to a $4.19 billion increase in the average balance, reflecting increases in our core investment of first mortgage loans. The $34.3 million increase in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to a $2.05 billion increase in the average balance reflecting increased purchases of variable-rate securities during 2006.
Total interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $435.9 million, or 36.9%, to $1.61 billion compared with $1.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to a $7.26 billion, or 30.3%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $31.23 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $23.97 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflecting our internally generated balance sheet growth and the investment of the net proceeds from the second-step conversion and stock offering in June 2005. The increase in interest and dividend income was also due to a 25 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield on total average interest-earning assets to 5.17% for 2006 compared with 4.92% for 2005.
 
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $243.1 million primarily due to an increase in the average balance of $4.03 billion. The $64.6 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to growth in the average balance of $1.19 billion, which reflected the investment into short-term securities of part of the net proceeds from the second-step conversion and stock offering. The $108.9 million increase in interest on mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to a $1.80 billion increase in the average balance reflecting increased purchases of variable-rate securities during 2006.
Total interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2006 increased $120.2 million, or 66.8%, to $300.1 million compared with $179.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005. This increase was partially due to a $7.51 billion, or 35.2%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $28.84 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2006 compared with $21.33 billion for the corresponding period in 2005. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities funded our asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 78 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.13% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2006 compared with 3.35% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2005, which reflected the growth and repricing of our interest-bearing liabilities during the rising short-term interest rate environment experienced during 2006.
Interest expense on borrowed funds for the three months ended December 31, 2006 increased $71.3 million, or 73.9%, to $167.7 million primarily due to a $5.84 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 41 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth. The increase in the annualized weighted-average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the increasing interest rate environment. The $48.9 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was due to a 114 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost due to the rising short-term interest rate environment, the competitive pricing of our deposit products and a shift by our customers, during 2006, to higher costing short-term time deposits from our High Value Checking product. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits also was due to the growth in the average balance of $1.67 billion, reflecting in part, the acquisition of Sound Federal.
Total interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $384.8 million, or 62.4%, to $1.00 billion compared with $616.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was partially due to a $5.89 billion, or 29.4%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $25.93 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $20.04 billion for the corresponding period in 2005. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities funded our asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 78 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 3.86% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 3.08% for the year ended December 31, 2005, which reflected the growth and repricing of our interest-bearing liabilities during the rising short-term interest rate environment experienced during 2006.
Interest expense on borrowed funds for 2006 increased $242.5 million due to a $5.38 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 34 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with a higher rate than the existing borrowings. The $142.4 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was due to a 111 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost due to the rising short-term interest rate environment, the competitive pricing of our deposit products and a shift by our customers, during 2006, to higher costing short-term time deposits from our High Value Checking product.
 
Net interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2006 decreased $3.6 million, or 2.4%, to $148.8 million compared with $152.4 million for the corresponding period in 2005. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets, was 1.16% for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with 1.59% for the corresponding period in 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2006, our net interest margin, determined by dividing annualized net interest income by total average interest-earning assets, was 1.78% compared with 2.29% for the corresponding 2005 period. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $51.1 million, or 9.1%, to $613.2 million compared with $562.1 million for the corresponding 2005 period. Our net interest rate spread was 1.31% for 2006 compared with 1.84% for the year 2005. Our net interest margin was 1.96% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with 2.35% for 2005.
The decrease in our net interest income when comparing the fourth quarter of 2006 to the fourth quarter of 2005 reflected the tightening of our net interest rate spread as a result of the rising short-term interest rate environment. The increase in our net interest income when comparing the year ended December 31, 2006 to the comparable 2005 period reflected our overall balance sheet growth and the investment into short-term securities of the net proceeds from the second-step conversion and stock offering, partially offset by the increase in the costs of our deposits and borrowed funds due to the rising short-term interest rate environment. The decrease in the net interest rate spread and net interest margin was primarily due to the increase in the weighted-average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. This increase reflected the rising short-term interest rate environment, affecting both our deposits and borrowed funds, and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short-term time deposits.
The allowance for loan losses amounted to $30.6 million and $27.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was due to the inclusion of Sound Federal's allowance for loan losses as a result of the acquisition. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.16% at December 31, 2006 compared with 0.18% at December 31, 2005. We did not record a provision for loan losses during the three-month periods ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, nor did we record a provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2006. We did record a provision of $65,000 during 2005. Net charge-offs for the year 2006 were $76,000 compared with net recoveries of $8,000 for 2005. Non-performing loans at December 31, 2006 were $30.0 million compared with $19.3 million at December 31, 2005. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.16% at December 31, 2006 compared with 0.13% at December 31, 2005. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 102.09% at December 31, 2006 compared with 141.84% at December 31, 2005.
Total non-interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2006 was $1.9 million compared with $1.5 million for the corresponding 2005 period. Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6.3 million compared with $8.0 million for the comparable period in 2005. The decrease in total non-interest income in the year reflected decreases in gains on securities transactions, net, as there were minimal realized gains/losses from sales of securities that occurred during 2006.
Total non-interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2006 was $41.6 million compared with $33.8 million during the corresponding 2005 period. This increase reflected a $3.6 million increase in compensation and employee benefits primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of $1.4 million and a $664,000 increase in expense related to our employee stock ownership plan, reflecting increases in our stock price. Expense related to stock options granted amounted to $2.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily reflecting the expensing of the options granted in July 2006. Total non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $159.0 million compared with $127.7 million for 2005. This increase reflected a $20.2 million increase in compensation and employee benefits
 
primarily due to an increase in the expense related to our employee stock ownership plan. Expense related to stock options granted amounted to $5.5 million during 2006.
Income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2006 was $40.0 million compared with $45.3 million for the corresponding 2005 period. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2006 was 36.60% compared with 37.72% for the corresponding period in 2005. The 11.7% decrease in income tax expense reflected the 9.1% decrease in income before income tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $172.0 million compared with $166.3 million for the corresponding 2005 period. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 37.34% compared with 37.60% for the year 2005. The 3.4% increase in income tax expense reflected the 4.1% increase in income before income tax expense. Final regulations were issued in February 2006 by the State of New Jersey eliminating the deduction for dividends received from a real estate investment trust subsidiary. As a result of this change in tax regulations, we anticipate our effective tax rate may increase approximately 2% beginning in 2007.
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $7.43 billion, or 26.5%, to $35.51 billion at December 31, 2006 from $28.08 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase in total assets primarily reflected a $4.03 billion increase in net loans and a $2.42 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities.
The increase in loans reflected purchases and originations of first mortgage loans of approximately $2.71 billion and $2.12 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $3.68 billion and $2.07 billion, respectively, for the year 2005. The increase in loans also reflected the addition of approximately $786.1 million of loans due to the acquisition of Sound Federal. Loan originations and purchases were substantially all in one- to four-family mortgage loans. Purchased mortgage loans allow us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. At December 31, 2006, we were committed to purchase and originate $951.0 million and $169.6 million, respectively, of first mortgage loans, which are expected to settle during the first quarter of 2007.
The increase in total mortgage-backed securities reflected purchases of approximately $3.93 billion, approximately 98.7% of which were variable-rate (adjustable annually) or hybrid (adjustable annually after fixed periods of three to five years) instruments. All of our mortgage-backed securities are directly or indirectly insured or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise. At December 31, 2006, we were committed to purchase $846.9 million of mortgage-backed securities, which are expected to settle during the first quarter of 2007.
Total liabilities increased $7.72 billion, or 33.7%, to $30.59 billion at December 31, 2006 from $22.87 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $5.62 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $2.03 billion increase in deposits, including the $1.06 billion of deposits due to the acquisition of Sound Federal. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of securing $9.14 billion of new borrowings at a weighted-average rate of 4.30%. These new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates ranging from one to three years. The increase in total deposits reflected a $2.92 billion increase in our time deposits, including $780.0 million due to the acquisition of Sound Federal, and a $576.5 million increase in our money market checking accounts. These increases were partially offset by a $1.52 billion decrease in our interest-bearing transaction accounts, primarily from our High Value Checking account product, due to customers shifting deposits to short-term time deposits.
Total stockholders' equity decreased $280.6 million to $4.92 billion at December 31, 2006 from $5.20 billion at December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of 33,747,243 shares of
 
outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $448.2 million and cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $161.4 million. These decreases to stockholders' equity were partially offset by net income of $288.6 million for 2006. As of December 31, 2006, 44,314,000 shares were available for repurchase under our existing stock repurchase programs. At December 31, 2006, our stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 13.86% and our year-to-date average stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 16.00%. At December 31, 2006, our tangible book value per share was $9.13.
