RELEASE 5:00PM  APRIL 24, 2007
Paramus, New Jersey, April 24, 2007  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today the results of its operations for the first quarter of 2007.
Financial Highlights
 
Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "This continues to be a challenging environment for the financial services industry. We are pleased that, despite an inverted yield curve, we have been able to maintain diluted earnings per share at $0.13, unchanged from the first quarter of 2006. Since December 31, 2006, we have grown the loan portfolio by 6.2% and our deposit base by 3.7%. We are also excited that we will be opening four branches in the second quarter of 2007, two of which are in Fairfield County, Connecticut." Mr. Hermance continued, "The financial services industry is being impacted by the down-turn in the sub-prime lending market and the related increases in foreclosures and payment defaults on these loans. We have been able to avoid these problems by not engaging in sub-prime lending and we do not offer riskier loan products such as option ARM loans or loans with negative amortization features. We remain committed to our traditional thrift business model. We believe that our market area provides us with many opportunities to grow the Hudson City franchise. During 2006, we took the opportunity to expand our franchise by adding 21 branches to our branch network, which represents a 23% increase. As of today, we have a total of 114 branches. By remaining focused on our business model, we believe we can continue to build stockholder value. As always, we appreciate the support of our stockholders and customers."
Statement of Income Summary
Net interest income decreased $1.2 million, or 0.8%, to $156.5 million for the first quarter of 2007 as compared to $157.7 million for the first quarter of 2006. Our net interest rate spread decreased 38 basis points to 1.10% for the first quarter of 2007 from 1.48% for the first quarter of 2006. Our net interest margin decreased 47 basis points to 1.70% from 2.17% for those same periods.
Market interest rates resulted in an inverted U.S. Treasury yield curve during 2006, which has continued into the first quarter of 2007. This market interest rate scenario has had a negative impact on our net interest margin and, as a result, on our net interest income, as the yields on our interest-earning assets have increased less than the costs of our interest-bearing liabilities. As interest rates change in the future, our interest-bearing liabilities will reprice to current market interest rates faster than our interest-earning assets.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2007 increased $119.9 million, or 33.3%, to $479.6 million as compared to $359.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.27 billion, or 25.4%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $35.81 billion for the first quarter of 2007 as compared to $28.54 billion for the first quarter of 2006. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 32 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.36% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2007 from 5.04% for the comparable period in 2006.
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $60.5 million to $269.7 million for the first quarter of 2007 versus the comparable period in 2006 primarily due to a $3.85 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan
 
portfolio. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a 15 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.67%, reflecting the origination and purchase of mortgage loans during the period of slightly rising interest rates in 2006.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $42.0 million to $123.8 million for the first quarter of 2007 as compared to $81.8 million for the first quarter of 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $2.64 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities during the first quarter of 2007 as compared to the first quarter of 2006, and a 48 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.05%.
Total interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2007 increased $121.2 million, or 60.0%, to $323.2 million as compared to $202.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $7.73 billion, or 33.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $30.77 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 compared with $23.04 billion for the first quarter of 2006. This increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 70 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.26% for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 compared with 3.56% for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. The increase in the average cost reflected the growth and re-pricing of our interest-bearing liabilities during 2006 as short-term interest rates, though relatively stable in the second half of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, increased in the first half of 2006, resulting in higher short-term interest rates in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006. The increase in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities reflected the rising short-term interest rate environment, affecting both our deposits and borrowed funds, a very competitive environment for deposits and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short-term time deposits.
Interest expense on deposits increased $52.6 million to $141.96 million for the first quarter of 2007 as compared to $89.36 million for the first quarter of 2006. This increase is due primarily to a $2.2 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $13.18 billion during the 2007 quarter as compared to the 2006 quarter. In addition, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 107 basis points to 4.37% for the 2007 quarter as compared to 3.30% for the 2006 quarter. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits reflects our growth strategy and includes deposits from the 21 branches added to our branch network as well as deposit growth in existing branches.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $68.6 million to $181.2 million for the first quarter of 2007 as compared to$112.6 million the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to a $5.52 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 40 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.18%. Borrowed funds were primarily used to fund the growth in interest-earning assets. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with a higher interest rate than existing borrowings.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $300,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 (none for the quarter ended March 31, 2006). The allowance for loan losses amounted to $31.0 million and $30.6 million at March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 respectively. We recorded net recoveries of $67,000 for the first quarter of 2007, compared to net recoveries of $500 for the first quarter of 2006. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.15% at March 31, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006. Non-performing loans, defined as non-accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, amounted to $34.2 million at March 31, 2007 and $30.0 million at December 31, 2006. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.17% at March 31, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 90.61% at March 31, 2007 compared with 102.09% at December 31, 2006.
 
Total non-interest income was $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared with $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2006. The increase in non-interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth.
Total non-interest expense increased $2.8 million, or 7.3%, to $41.1 million for the first quarter of 2007 from $38.3 million for the first quarter of 2006. The increase is primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in net occupancy expense and $1.6 million in other non-interest expense. The increase in net occupancy expense is primarily the result of our branch expansion, including the addition of 14 branches from Sound Federal in July 2006. The increase in other non-interest expense is also due primarily to the branch expansion as well as growth in the existing franchise. Our efficiency ratio was 26.01% for the first quarter of 2007 as compared to 24.09% for the first quarter of 2006. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the first quarter of 2007 was 0.45% as compared to 0.53% for the first quarter of 2006.
Income tax expense amounted to $45.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, unchanged from the first quarter of 2006. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2007 was 38.9% compared with 37.7% for the first quarter of 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the New Jersey tax code that eliminated the dividends received deduction for dividends paid by our real estate investment trust subsidiary to its parent company.
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $1.96 billion, or 5.5%, to $37.47 billion at March 31, 2007 from $35.51 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in total assets reflected a $1.19 billion increase in loans and a $1.03 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities.
The increase in loans reflected our continued loan purchase activity as well as our focus on the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. For the first three months of 2007, we purchased first mortgage loans of $1.1 billion and originated first mortgage loans of $563.2 million, compared to purchases of $811.2 million and originations of $518.6 million for the comparable period in 2006. The purchase of mortgage loans during the first quarter of 2007 allowed us to continue to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model.
The increase in total mortgage-backed securities reflected purchases of approximately $1.47 billion, approximately 98.6% of which were variable-rate instruments (adjustable annually) or hybrid instruments (adjustable annually after fixed periods of three to seven years).
Total liabilities increased $2.05 billion, or 6.7%, to $32.63 billion at March 31, 2007 from $30.58 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $1.54 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $498.7 million increase in deposits. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of $2.9 billion of new borrowings at a weighted-average rate of 4.31%, partially offset by repayments of $1.36 billion with a weighted average rate of 3.37%. The new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates ranging from one to three years. The increase in total deposits reflected a $569.6 million increase in our time deposits and a $50.4 million increase in our money market checking accounts. These increases were partially offset by a $142.8 million decrease in our interest-bearing transaction accounts, due primarily to customers shifting deposits to short-term time deposits.
Total stockholders' equity decreased $99.2 million to $4.83 billion at March 31, 2007 from $4.93 billion at December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of 11,268,300 shares of outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $153.1 million and cash dividends paid to common
 
stockholders of $41.7 million. These decreases to stockholders' equity were partially offset by net income of $71.2 million for the first quarter of 2007. As of March 31, 2007, 33.0 million shares were available for repurchase under our existing stock repurchase programs. At March 31, 2007, our stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 12.89%. At March 31, 2007, our tangible book value per share was $9.15.
