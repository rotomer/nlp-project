EXHIBIT 99.1
RELEASE 7:00AM  JULY 25, 2007
Paramus, New Jersey, July 25, 2007  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today that net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $72.7 million as compared to $73.2 million for the second quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share was $0.14 for the second quarter of 2007 as compared to $0.13 for the 2006 quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, net income amounted to $143.9 million as compared to $148.4 million for the same period in 2006. Diluted earnings per share was $0.28 for the six months ended June 30, 2007 as compared to $0.27 for the same period in 2006. The Company also announced that the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.085 per share. The cash dividend is payable on September 5, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 10, 2007.
Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased to report an increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.14 for the second quarter of 2007. We have been able to grow earnings per share by remaining focused on our traditional thrift business model which we believe works very well for Hudson City as well as continuing with our stock repurchase program. We are disciplined in actively managing our operating expenses and maintaining high asset quality as we grow the balance sheet. Our efficiency ratio continues to be industry leading and our asset quality remains very high. This allows us to operate at lower margins, grow the franchise and increase net interest income even during an unfavorable interest rate cycle such as we have been experiencing for the past two years. We have not had our earnings affected by the ongoing sub-prime market issues as we do not originate or purchase sub-prime loans, loans with high loan-to-value ratios, negative amortization loans or option ARM loans. Our conservative underwriting standards have resulted in cumulative net charge-offs of $557,000 over the past 10 years."
Mr. Hermance continued, "For the first six months of 2007, our assets grew by an annualized 24% which parallels our average growth of 21% for the last 8 years. This growth strategy positions us well for the future and adds to our already strong franchise value. With the shape of the yield curve and a common stock that we feel is attractively priced, we took the opportunity to repurchase 26,828,954 shares of our stock during the first six months of 2007. Due to our increased per share earnings, we are able to increase our dividend to $0.085 per share as part of our continuing commitment to our shareholders. Also, we opened four new branches during the quarter increasing our total footprint to 115 branches with three more to follow this summer."
Financial highlights for the second quarter of 2007 are as follows:
 
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $4.18 billion, or 11.8%, to $39.69 billion at June 30, 2007 from $35.51 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in total assets reflected a $2.82 billion increase in loans and a $1.77 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities.
The increase in loans reflected our continued loan purchase activity as well as our focus on the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. For the first six
 
months of 2007, we purchased first mortgage loans of $2.37 billion and originated first mortgage loans of $1.36 billion, compared to purchases of $1.49 billion and originations of $1.18 billion for the comparable period in 2006. The purchase of mortgage loans during the first six months of 2007 allowed us to continue to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model.
The increase in total mortgage-backed securities reflected purchases of approximately $2.74 billion, approximately 98% of which were variable-rate instruments (adjustable annually) or hybrid instruments (adjustable annually after fixed periods of three to seven years).
Total liabilities increased $4.46 billion, or 14.6%, to $35.04 billion at June 30, 2007 from $30.58 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $3.70 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $774.9 million increase in deposits. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of $6.0 billion of new borrowings at a weighted-average rate of 4.36%, partially offset by repayments of $2.31 billion with a weighted average rate of 3.78%. The new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates ranging from one to three years. The increase in total deposits reflected a $794.5 million increase in our time deposits and a $224.5 million increase in our money market checking accounts. These increases were partially offset by a $305.1 million decrease in our interest-bearing transaction accounts, due primarily to customers shifting deposits to short-term time deposits.
Total stockholders' equity decreased $277.1 million to $4.65 billion at June 30, 2007 from $4.93 billion at December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of 26,828,954 shares of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $357.6 million and cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $82.4 million. These decreases to stockholders' equity were partially offset by net income of $143.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, 17.5 million shares may be repurchased under our existing stock repurchase programs. At June 30, 2007, our stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 11.72% and our tangible book value per share was $9.06.
Statement of Income Summary
Net interest income increased $4.1 million, or 2.7%, to $157.7 million for the second quarter of 2007 as compared to $153.6 million for the second quarter of 2006. Net interest income increased $2.8 million, or 0.9%, to $314.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 compared to $311.3 million for the corresponding period in 2006. Our net interest margin decreased 38 basis points to 1.65% and our net interest rate spread decreased 26 basis points to 1.10%, when comparing the second quarter of 2007 with the corresponding period in 2006. Our net interest margin decreased 42 basis points to 1.67% and our net interest rate spread decreased 31 basis points to 1.10%, during the first six months of 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006.
During the second quarter of 2007, long-term rates, in particular the 10-year bond, increased while short-term rates decreased, resulting in a return to a slightly positively sloped yield curve. However, competitive pricing pressures continued to affect deposit pricing and the increase in longer-term interest rates have increased the cost of our borrowings which were primarily used to fund our mortgage loan production. The average yields earned on our interest-earning assets have also increased, but at a slower pace than the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Historically, fixed-rate mortgage loan rates follow the same trends as the 5- and 10-year U.S. Treasury rates.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended June 30, 2007 increased $127.4 million, or 33.2%, to $511.5 million as compared to $384.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2006. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.72 billion, or 25.6%, increase in
 
the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $37.92 billion for the second quarter of 2007 as compared to $30.20 billion for the second quarter of 2006. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 31 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.40% for the three month period ended June 30, 2007 from 5.09% for the comparable period in 2006.
Total interest and dividend income for the six months ended June 30, 2007 increased $247.3 million, or 33.2%, to $991.1 million as compared to $743.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.49 billion, or 25.5%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $36.87 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2007 as compared to $29.38 billion for the corresponding period in 2006. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 32 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.38% for the six months ended June 30, 2007 from 5.06% for the comparable period in 2006.
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $66.2 million to $289.8 million for the second quarter of 2007 as compared to $223.6 million for the same period in 2006 primarily due to a $4.32 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a 12 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.67%, reflecting the origination and purchase of mortgage loans during the period of rising interest rates in 2007.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $126.7 million to $559.5 million as compared to $432.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006 primarily due to a $4.09 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans. The increase in interest income on mortgage loans was also due to a 14 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.67%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $46.0 million to $136.4 million for the second quarter of 2007 as compared to $90.4 million for the second quarter of 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $2.91 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities during the second quarter of 2007 as compared to the second quarter of 2006, and a 45 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.11%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $88.0 million to $260.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 as compared to $172.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $2.78 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities during the first six months of 2007 as compared to the first six months of 2006, and a 47 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.08%.
The increases in the average balances of mortgage-backed securities were due to purchases of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The increase in the weighted average yields on mortgage-backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities at higher rates than the existing portfolio as well as the repricing of securities in the existing portfolio.
Total interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2007 increased $123.2 million, or 53.4%, to $353.8 million as compared to $230.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2006. This increase
 
was primarily due to an $8.22 billion, or 33.2%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $33.00 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 compared with $24.78 billion for the second quarter of 2006. This increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 57 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.30% for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 compared with 3.73% for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.
Total interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2007 increased $244.4 million, or 56.5%, to $677.0 million as compared to $432.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $7.97 billion, or 33.4%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $31.89 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2007 compared with $23.92 billion for the corresponding period in 2006. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 63 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.28% for the six months ended June 30, 2007 compared with 3.65% for the six months ended June 30, 2006.
The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three- and six-month periods in 2007 reflected higher short-term interest rates as compared to the same periods in 2006, which affects both our deposits and borrowed funds. We have also experienced a very competitive environment for deposits and a shift within our deposits to higher costing short-term time deposits.
Interest expense on deposits increased $48.0 million to $146.4 million for the second quarter of 2007 as compared to $98.4 million for the second quarter of 2006. This increase is due primarily to a $2.32 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $13.43 billion during the second quarter of 2007 quarter as compared to the comparable period in 2006. In addition, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 82 basis points to 4.37% for the 2007 quarter as compared to 3.55% for the 2006 quarter.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, interest expense on deposits increased $100.6 million to $288.4 million as compared to $187.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006. This increase is due primarily to a $2.26 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $13.30 billion during the first six months of 2007 as compared to $11.04 billion for the first six months of 2006. In addition, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 94 basis points to 4.37% for the six months ended June 30, 2007 as compared to 3.43% for the corresponding period in 2006.
The increases in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits reflects our growth strategy and includes deposits from the 21 branches added to our branch network during 2006 as well as deposit growth in existing branches. The increase in the average cost of deposits for the three- and six-month periods reflected a very competitive environment for deposits and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short-term time deposits.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $75.3 million to $207.4 million for the second quarter of 2007 as compared to $132.1 million for the second quarter of 2006 primarily due to a $5.90 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 37 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.25%.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $143.8 million to $388.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 as compared to $244.8 million the six months ended June 30, 2006 primarily due to a $5.71 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 39 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.22%.
 
Borrowed funds were primarily used to fund the growth in interest-earning assets. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with a higher interest rate than existing borrowings and borrowings that were called.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $500,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 (none for the quarter ended June 30, 2006). The provision for loan losses amounted to $800,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2007 (none for the comparable period in 2006). The allowance for loan losses amounted to $31.5 million and $30.6 million at June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 respectively. We recorded net recoveries of $31,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2007 as compared to net recoveries of $2,000 for the first six months of 2006. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.14% at June 30, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 81.81% at June 30, 2007 compared with 102.09% at December 31, 2006. Non-performing loans, defined as non-accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, amounted to $38.5 million at June 30, 2007 and $30.0 million at December 31, 2006. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.18% at June 30, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006.
Total non-interest income was $1.8 million for the second quarter of 2007 compared with $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2006. Total non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $3.4 million compared with $2.7 million for the comparable period in 2006. The increase in non-interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth.
Total non-interest expense increased $2.4 million, or 6.2%, to $40.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007 from $38.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2006. The increase is primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in net occupancy expense, a $421,000 increase in compensation and benefits and a $401,000 increase in other non-interest expense. Total non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $82.0 million compared with $76.8 million during the corresponding 2006 period. The increase is primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in net occupancy expense and a $2.1 million increase in other non-interest expense. The increase in net occupancy expense and other non-interest expense is primarily the result of our branch expansion, including the addition of 14 branches from the Sound Federal acquisition in July 2006 as well as growth in the existing franchise.
Our efficiency ratio was 25.62% for the three months ended June 30, 2007 as compared to 24.84% for the three months ended June 30, 2006. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the second quarter of 2007 was 0.42% as compared to 0.50% for the second quarter of 2006. Our efficiency ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was 25.82% compared with 24.46% for the corresponding 2006 period. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was 0.44% compared with 0.52% for the corresponding period in 2006.
Income tax expense amounted to $45.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007 compared with $43.4 million for the corresponding period in 2006. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2007 was 38.48% compared with 37.21% for the corresponding period in 2006. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $90.8 million compared with $88.8 million for the corresponding 2006 period. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was 38.69% compared with 37.44% for the six months ended June 30, 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the New Jersey tax code that eliminated the dividends received deduction for dividends paid by our real estate investment trust subsidiary to its parent company.
