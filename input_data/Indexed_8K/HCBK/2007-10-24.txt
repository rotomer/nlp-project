Exhibit 99.1
RELEASE 7:00AM  OCTOBER 24, 2007
Paramus, New Jersey, October 24, 2007  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today that net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $74.4 million as compared to $71.0 million for the third quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share increased 15.4% to $0.15 for the third quarter of 2007 as compared to $0.13 for the 2006 quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net income amounted to $218.4 million as compared to $219.4 million for the same period in 2006. Diluted earnings per share was $0.42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to $0.40 for the same period in 2006. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 per share. The cash dividend is payable on December 1, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 13, 2007.
Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased to report record third quarter earnings per share of $0.15 on a diluted basis. The increase in earnings per share reflects our continued focus on our traditional thrift business model. These earnings occurred in a quarter that found many mortgage lenders struggling. While we are not immune from economic and market conditions our earnings have not been significantly affected by the current mortgage-market turmoil since we only originate and purchase residential mortgage loans to qualified borrowers with considerable down payment amounts. Our non-performing loans amounted to $58.8 million or 0.26% of total loans at September 30, 2007, compared to $38.5 million or 0.18% at June 30, 2007. While our non-performing loans have been increasing during 2007, as a percentage of total loans they are now comparable to historical norms. From 2000 to 2002, our non-performing loans to total loans averaged 0.27%. Since 2003, we have experienced steady declines in our non-performing loan ratio to historical lows as a result of low market interest rates, strong real estate markets, and strong portfolio growth."
Mr. Hermance continued, "With our strong capital and liquidity positions, we continued to execute our growth strategy during the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2007, on an annualized basis our assets grew by 25.6%, our net loans grew by 27.7% and our deposits grew by 12.0%. We opened three new branches during the quarter and a fourth branch in early October increasing our total footprint to 119 branches. In addition, we have recently committed to opening three branches in Fairfield County, Connecticut, one in Suffolk County, New York and one in Ocean County, New Jersey in the first half of 2008. We are very excited about the opportunities that these market areas present. The demographics of these communities match very closely with our thrift business model and product offerings."
Mr. Hermance continued, "During the third quarter, short-term interest rates decreased and the yield curve began to steepen. As a result of these interest rate changes and our growth strategy, our interest rate
 
spread increased to 1.14% for the third quarter from 1.10% for the linked quarter and our net interest margin remained unchanged at 1.65%. We repurchased 9,850,000 shares of our common stock during the third quarter and have repurchased 36,678,954 shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. We repurchased fewer shares in the third quarter as compared to the preceding two quarters due to the growth opportunities that were available to us."
Financial highlights for the third quarter of 2007 are as follows:
 
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $6.81 billion, or 19.2%, to $42.32 billion at September 30, 2007 from $35.51 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in total assets reflected a $3.96 billion increase in loans and a $3.19 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities.
The increase in loans reflected our continued loan purchase activity as well as our focus on the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. For the first nine months of 2007, we purchased first mortgage loans of $3.06 billion and originated first mortgage loans of $2.44 billion, compared to purchases of $1.91 billion and originations of $1.67 billion for the comparable period in 2006. The purchase of mortgage loans during the first nine months of 2007 allowed us to continue to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model.
The increase in total mortgage-backed securities reflected purchases of approximately $4.65 billion, substantially all of which were variable-rate instruments.
Total liabilities increased $7.15 billion, or 23.4%, to $37.73 billion at September 30, 2007 from $30.58 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $5.92 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $1.21 billion increase in deposits. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of $9.03 billion of new borrowings at a weighted-average rate of 4.31%, partially offset by repayments of $3.11 billion with a weighted average rate of 3.66%. The new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates ranging from one to five years. The increase in total deposits reflected a $1.27 billion increase in our time deposits and a $434.0 million increase in our money market checking accounts. These increases were partially offset by a $515.4 million decrease in our interest-bearing transaction accounts, due primarily to customers shifting deposits to short-term time deposits.
Total stockholders' equity decreased $340.7 million to $4.59 billion at September 30, 2007 from $4.93 billion at December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of 36,678,954 shares of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $491.3 million and cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $124.3 million. These decreases to stockholders' equity were partially offset by net income of $218.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. At September 30, 2007, our stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 10.85% and our tangible book value per share was $9.10.
Statement of Income Summary
Net interest income increased $9.1 million, or 5.9%, to $162.2 million for the third quarter of 2007 as compared to $153.1 million for the third quarter of 2006. Net interest income increased $11.9 million, or 2.6%, to $476.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to $464.4 million for the corresponding period in 2006. During the third quarter of 2007, our net interest rate spread decreased 16 basis points to 1.14% and our net interest margin decreased 28 basis points to 1.65% as compared to the corresponding period in 2006. During the first nine months of 2007, our net interest rate spread decreased 26 basis points to 1.11% and our net interest margin decreased 37 basis points to 1.66% as compared to the same period in 2006.
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank ("FOMC") decreased the overnight lending rate by 50 basis points at its meeting in September 2007 to 4.75%. This decrease in the overnight lending rate was the first rate change since June 2006. As a result, short-term market interest rates continued to decrease during the third quarter. Intermediate-term market interest rates, those with maturities of two to five years, and long-term market interest rates also decreased during the third quarter
 
of 2007, but at a slower pace than the short-term interest rates. The result of these interest rate changes was a steepening of the yield curve during the third quarter of 2007. During the third quarter of 2007, our net interest rate spread increased 4 basis points from the second quarter of 2007 due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended September 30, 2007 increased $126.2 million, or 29.9%, to $548.2 million as compared to $422.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.93 billion, or 24.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $40.11 billion for the third quarter of 2007 as compared to $32.18 billion for the third quarter of 2006. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 22 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.47% for the three month period ended September 30, 2007 from 5.25% for the comparable period in 2006.
Total interest and dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 increased $373.5 million, or 31.9%, to $1.54 billion as compared to $1.17 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.64 billion, or 25.2%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $37.96 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to $30.32 billion for the corresponding period in 2006. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 28 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.41% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 from 5.13% for the comparable period in 2006.
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $67.7 million to $313.9 million for the third quarter of 2007 as compared to $246.2 million for the same period in 2006 primarily due to a $4.64 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a three basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.71%.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $194.4 million to $873.4 million as compared to $679.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 primarily due to a $4.27 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans. The increase in interest income on mortgage loans was also due to a 10 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.68%, reflecting the origination and purchase of mortgage loans during the period of rising interest rates in 2007.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $51.5 million to $151.1 million for the third quarter of 2007 as compared to $99.6 million for the third quarter of 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $3.36 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities during the third quarter of 2007 as compared to the third quarter of 2006, and a 37 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.20%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $139.5 million to $411.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to $271.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $2.97 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities during the first nine months of 2007 as compared to the first nine months of 2006, and a 43 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.12%. The increases in the average balances of mortgage-backed securities were due to purchases of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities provides
 
us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The increase in the weighted average yields on mortgage-backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities at higher rates than the existing portfolio as well as the repricing of securities in the existing portfolio.
Total interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2007 increased $117.1 million, or 43.5%, to $386.0 million as compared to $268.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. This increase was primarily due to an $8.36 billion, or 31.0%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $35.34 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 compared with $26.98 billion for the third quarter of 2006. This increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 38 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.33% for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 compared with 3.95% for the quarter ended September 30, 2006.
Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 increased $361.5 million, or 51.5%, to $1.06 billion as compared to $701.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. This increase was primarily due to an $8.11 billion, or 32.5%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $33.06 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared with $24.95 billion for the corresponding period in 2006. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 54 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.30% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared with 3.76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006.
The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three- and nine-month periods in 2007 reflected a very competitive environment for deposits and a shift within our deposits to higher costing short-term time deposits. In addition, higher short-term interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006, affected the average cost of both our deposits and borrowed funds.
Interest expense on deposits increased $39.2 million to $155.1 million for the third quarter of 2007 as compared to $115.9 million for the third quarter of 2006. This increase is due primarily to a $2.02 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $13.85 billion during the third quarter of 2007 quarter as compared to $11.83 billion for the comparable period in 2006. In addition, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 55 basis points to 4.44% for the 2007 quarter as compared to 3.89% for the 2006 quarter.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, interest expense on deposits increased $139.8 million to $443.5 million as compared to $303.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. This increase is due primarily to a $2.19 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $13.49 billion during the first nine months of 2007 as compared to $11.30 billion for the first nine months of 2006. In addition, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 81 basis points to 4.40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to 3.59% for the corresponding period in 2006.
The increases in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits reflects our growth strategy and includes deposits from the 28 branches added to our branch network during 2006 and 2007, as well as deposit growth in existing branches. The increase in the average cost of deposits for the three- and nine-month periods reflected a very competitive environment for deposits and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short-term time deposits.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $77.9 million to $230.9 million for the third quarter of 2007 as compared to $153.0 million for the third quarter of 2006 primarily due to a $6.35 billion increase in the
 
average balance of borrowed funds and a 25 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.26%.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $221.8 million to $619.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to $397.8 million the nine months ended September 30, 2006 primarily due to a $5.93 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 33 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.23%.
Borrowed funds were primarily used to fund the growth in interest-earning assets. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with a higher interest rate than existing borrowings and borrowings that were called.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 (none for the quarter ended September 30, 2006). The provision for loan losses amounted to $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 (none for the comparable period in 2006). The increase in the provision for loan losses was due primarily to an increase in non-performing loans and also to the growth in the loan portfolio. Non-performing loans, defined as non-accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, amounted to $58.8 million at September 30, 2007 and $30.0 million at December 31, 2006. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.26% at September 30, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $32.9 million and $30.6 million at September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans and non-performing loans was 0.14% and 55.87%, respectively at September 30, 2007 as compared to 0.16% and 102.09%, respectively at December 31, 2006. We recorded net charge-offs of $575,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to net recoveries of $2,000 for the first nine months of 2006. The increase in charge-offs was related to non-performing residential mortgage loans for which appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral.
Total non-interest income was $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2007 compared with $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2006. Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $5.4 million compared with $4.4 million for the comparable period in 2006. The increase in non-interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth.
Total non-interest expense increased $600,000, or 1.5%, to $41.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007 from $40.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. The increase is primarily due to a $1.2 million increase in net occupancy expense, partially offset by a $348,000 decrease in other non-interest expense and a $146,000 decrease in computer and related services. Total non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $123.2 million compared with $117.4 million during the corresponding 2006 period. The increase is primarily due to a $4.4 million increase in net occupancy expense and a $1.7 million increase in other non-interest expense. The increase in net occupancy expense and other non-interest expense is primarily the result of our branch expansion, including the addition of 14 branches from the Sound Federal acquisition in July 2006 as well as growth in the existing franchise.
Our efficiency ratio was 25.07% for the three months ended September 30, 2007 as compared to 26.22% for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the third quarter of 2007 was 0.40% as compared to 0.50% for the third quarter of 2006. Our efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was 25.56% compared with 25.04% for the corresponding 2006 period. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the nine
 
months ended September 30, 2007 was 0.43% compared with 0.51% for the corresponding period in 2006.
Income tax expense amounted to $46.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared with $43.2 million for the corresponding period in 2006. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2007 was 38.52% compared with 37.86% for the corresponding period in 2006. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $137.4 million compared with $132.0 million for the corresponding 2006 period. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was 38.63% compared with 37.57% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the New Jersey tax code that eliminated the dividends received deduction for dividends paid by our real estate investment trust subsidiary to its parent company.
