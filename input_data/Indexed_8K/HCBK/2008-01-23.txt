Exhibit 99.1
RELEASE 7:00AM  JANUARY 23, 2008
Paramus, New Jersey, January 23, 2008  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today that net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was a record-high for Hudson City at $77.5 million as compared to $69.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share increased 23.1% to $0.16 for the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to $0.13 for the fourth quarter of 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net income amounted to $295.9 million as compared to $288.6 million for 2006. Diluted earnings per share was $0.58 for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $0.53 for 2006. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share. The cash dividend is payable on March 1, 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2008.
Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The fourth quarter of 2007 was an exciting time for our Company. We reported net income of $77.5 million or $0.16 per share  a record-high for Hudson City. We were also named the Best Managed Bank of 2007 by and we were cited as the top-performing bank in the S&P 500 with an 8.2% increase in the price of our stock during 2007. We are especially pleased that we were able to generate these returns for our stockholders in a quarter that was challenging for the financial services industry. The weakening housing market and sub-prime mortgage crisis continues to affect the industry, but because we never offered sub-prime loans and other exotic loan products, our earnings have not been significantly affected by credit losses. In addition, our investment portfolio includes only Government-sponsored agency bonds and Government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities. While our non-performing assets have increased and housing market conditions have deteriorated during 2007, we have not experienced significant charge-offs. This is because we require that borrowers have significant equity in the underlying property which provides protection to both us and our borrowers in challenging economic times."
Forbes
Mr. Hermance continued, "The Federal Reserve lowered the target Federal funds rate to 4.25% during the fourth quarter and the Treasury yield curve steepened. However, competitive pricing pressures slowed the lowering of deposit costs and, as a result, our margin decreased slightly to 1.64% from 1.65% from the linked quarter. Despite the slight margin compression, we were able to grow net interest income 5.3% over the linked quarter and 14.8% over the 2006 quarter as a result of our growth initiatives. We grew the loan portfolio 27% in 2007 to $24.20 billion and grew deposits by 13% to $15.15 billion. We were able to achieve this growth because of our strong capital and liquidity positions while many of our competitors were scaling back loan production. As expected, the Federal Reserve continued to lower short-term interest rates in January and it is widely anticipated that further reductions will occur during 2008. We believe that these interest rate reductions will cause deposit pricing competition to rationalize which should result in higher margins and profit growth. However, even if the Federal Reserve does not lower interest rates, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to grow earnings in 2008. Our growth strategy, our liquidity and capital positions and our industry-leading efficiency ratio allows us to increase net interest income even in a static interest rate environment. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to open 8 new branches in 2008 and continue developing our newer markets in
 
Connecticut and New York. While we have operated in Fairfield County, Connecticut for only 18 months, loan production from this market is second only to Bergen County, New Jersey where our headquarters is located. As always, we appreciate the confidence and loyalty of our stockholders and customers and we look forward to 2008 with great excitement."
Financial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2007 are as follows:
 
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $8.91 billion, or 25.1%, to $44.42 billion at December 31, 2007 from $35.51 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in total assets reflected a $5.13 billion increase in loans and a $5.24 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities.
The increase in loans reflected our continued loan purchase activity as well as our focus on the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. During 2007, we purchased $3.97 billion of loans and originated $3.35 billion of loans, compared to purchases of $2.71 billion and originations of $2.31 billion in 2006. The purchase of mortgage loans during 2007 allowed us to continue to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model.
The $5.24 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities reflected purchases of approximately $7.09 billion, substantially all of which were variable-rate instruments.
Total liabilities increased $9.23 billion, or 30.2%, to $39.81 billion at December 31, 2007 from $30.58 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $7.17 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $1.73 billion increase in deposits. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of $10.73 billion of new borrowings at a weighted-average rate of 4.22%, partially offset by repayments of $3.56 billion with a weighted average rate of 3.57%. The new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates ranging from one to five years. The increase in total deposits reflected a $1.64 billion increase in our time deposits and a $656.5 million increase in our money market checking accounts. These increases were partially offset by a $575.2 million decrease in our interest-bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts, due primarily to customers shifting deposits to short-term time deposits.
Total stockholders' equity decreased $318.9 million to $4.61 billion at December 31, 2007 from $4.93 billion at December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of 40,578,954 shares of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $550.2 million and cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $165.4 million. These decreases to stockholders' equity were partially offset by net income of $295.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and a $66.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2007, our stockholders' equity to asset ratio was 10.38% and our tangible book value per share was $9.22.
The accumulated other comprehensive income of $16.6 million at December 31, 2007 includes a $19.6 million after-tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale ($33.2 million pre-tax). We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as U.S. Government and Agency securities. The Company does not purchase unrated or private label mortgage-backed securities or other higher risk securities such as those backed by sub-prime loans. The accumulated other comprehensive income of $16.6 million at December 31, 2007 represented an improvement from the accumulated other comprehensive loss of $49.6 million at December 31, 2006 reflecting an net unrealized gain on securities available for sale as compared to a net unrealized loss at December 31, 2006 as a result of lower market interest rates.
 
Statement of Income Summary
Net interest income increased $22.1 million, or 14.9%, to $170.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to $148.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. Net interest income increased $34.0 million, or 5.5%, to $647.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $613.2 million for the corresponding period in 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2007, our net interest rate spread was 1.16%, unchanged from the same quarter in 2006. Our net interest margin decreased 14 basis points to 1.64% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. During 2007, our net interest rate spread decreased 20 basis points to 1.11% and our net interest margin decreased 31 basis points to 1.65% as compared to 2006.
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank ("FOMC") decreased the overnight lending rate by an additional 50 basis points to 4.25% during the fourth quarter. As a result, short-term market interest rates continued to decrease. Longer-term market interest rates also decreased during the fourth quarter of 2007, but at a slower pace than the short-term interest rates and, as a result, the yield curve steepened. However, competitive pricing pressures prevented us from lowering our deposit costs to the same extent as the decreases in the yield curve. As a result, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin were substantially unchanged from the linked quarter.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended December 31, 2007 increased $139.2 million, or 31.0%, to $588.2 million as compared to $449.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2006. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to an $8.63 billion, or 25.4%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $42.57 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to $33.94 billion for the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 24 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.53% for the three month period ended December 31, 2007 from 5.29% for the comparable period in 2006.
Total interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $512.7 million, or 31.8%, to $2.13 billion as compared to $1.61 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.99 billion, or 25.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $39.22 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $31.23 billion for 2006. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 25 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.42% for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 5.17% for 2006.
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $78.6 million to $332.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to $253.5 million for the same period in 2006 primarily due to a $5.06 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a 13 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.74%.
For the year ended December 31, 2007, interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $272.9 million to $1.21 billion as compared to $932.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $4.52 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans. The increase in interest income on mortgage loans was also due to a 9 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.68%, reflecting the origination and purchase of mortgage loans during the period of rising interest rates during the first half of 2007.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $66.4 million to $176.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to $110.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. This increase was due primarily to a
 
$4.43 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities during the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, and a 34 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.30%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $205.9 million to $587.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $382.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $3.37 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities during 2007 as compared to 2006, and a 40 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.16%.
The increases in the average balances of mortgage-backed securities were due to purchases of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The increase in the weighted average yields on mortgage-backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities at higher rates than the existing portfolio as well as the repricing of securities in the existing portfolio.
Total interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2007 increased $117.2 million, or 39.1%, to $417.3 million as compared to $300.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $9.04 billion, or 31.3%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $37.88 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 compared with $28.84 billion for the fourth quarter of 2006. This increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 24 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.37% for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 compared with 4.13% for the quarter ended December 31, 2006.
Total interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $478.7 million, or 47.9%, to $1.48 billion as compared to $1.00 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to an $8.43 billion, or 32.5%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $34.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $25.93 billion for 2006. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 45 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.31% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with 3.86% for the year ended December 31, 2006.
The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three- and twelve-month periods in 2007 reflected a very competitive environment for deposits and a shift within our deposits to higher costing short-term time deposits as well as the growth and re-pricing of our interest-bearing liabilities during the higher short-term interest rate environment experienced during the second half of 2006 and first half of 2007.
Interest expense on deposits increased $31.1 million to $163.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to $132.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. This increase is due primarily to a $1.81 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $14.44 billion during the fourth quarter of 2007 quarter as compared to $12.63 billion for the comparable period in 2006. In addition, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 33 basis points to 4.49% for the 2007 quarter as compared to 4.16% for the 2006 quarter.
For the year ended December 31, 2007, interest expense on deposits increased $170.8 million to $606.9 million as compared to $436.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase is due
 
primarily to a $2.12 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $13.76 billion during 2007 as compared to $11.64 billion for 2006. In addition, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 66 basis points to 4.41% for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 3.75% for 2006.
The increases in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits reflects our growth strategy and includes deposits from the 29 branches added to our branch network during 2006 and 2007, as well as deposit growth in existing branches. The increase in the average cost of deposits for the three- and twelve-month periods reflected a very competitive environment for deposits and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short-term time deposits.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $86.1 million to $253.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to $167.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 primarily due to a $7.23 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 20 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.30%.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $307.9 million to $873.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $565.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $6.3 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 28 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.24%.
Borrowed funds were primarily used to fund the growth in interest-earning assets. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with higher interest rates than existing borrowings and borrowings that were called.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $2.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 (none for the quarter ended December 31, 2006) and $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 (none for the comparable period in 2006). The increase in the provision for loan losses was due primarily to an increase in non-performing loans and also to the growth in the loan portfolio. Non-performing loans, defined as non-accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, amounted to $79.4 million at December 31, 2007 and $30.0 million at December 31, 2006. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.33% at December 31, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $34.7 million and $30.6 million at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans and non-performing loans was 0.14% and 43.8%, respectively at December 31, 2007 as compared to 0.16% and 102.09%, respectively at December 31, 2006. We recorded net charge-offs of $684,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to net charge-offs of $76,000 for 2006. The increase in charge-offs was related to non-performing residential mortgage loans for which appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral.
Total non-interest income was $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of both 2007 and 2006. Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $7.3 million compared with $6.3 million for 2006.
Total non-interest expense increased $3.2 million, or 7.7%, to $44.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007 from $41.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily due to a $3.4 million increase in compensation and benefits expense. Total non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $167.9 million compared with $159.0 million for 2006. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in net occupancy expense and a $3.2 million increase in compensation expense. The increase in net occupancy expense and compensation expense is primarily
 
the result of our branch expansion, including the addition of 14 branches from the Sound Federal acquisition in July 2006 as well as growth in the existing franchise.
Our efficiency ratio was 25.92% for the three months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 27.58% for the three months ended December 31, 2006. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 0.41% as compared to 0.48% for the fourth quarter of 2006. Our efficiency ratio was 25.66% for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 0.42% compared with 0.50% for 2006.
Income tax expense amounted to $48.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007 compared with $40.0 million for the corresponding period in 2006. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2007 was 38.46% compared with 36.60% for the corresponding period in 2006. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $185.9 million compared with $172.0 million for 2006. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 38.59% compared with 37.34% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the New Jersey tax code that eliminated the dividends received deduction for dividends paid by our real estate investment trust subsidiary to its parent company.
