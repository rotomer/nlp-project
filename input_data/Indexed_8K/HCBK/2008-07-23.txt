Exhibit 99.1
RELEASE 8:00AM  JULY 23, 2008
Paramus, New Jersey, July 23, 2008  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today that net income for the second quarter of 2008 increased 52.3% to $110.7 million as compared to $72.7 million for the second quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share increased 57.1% to $0.22 for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $0.14 for the second quarter of 2007. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, net income increased 38.6% to $199.4 million as compared to $143.9 million for the same period in 2007. Diluted earnings per share increased 42.9% to $0.40 for the six months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to $0.28 for the same period in 2007. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share, an increase of 50% since the second quarter of 2007.
Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our business model and the current interest rate environment continue to provide Hudson City with record earnings in the most difficult financial and credit markets in decades. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2008 increased 57% from the second quarter of 2007. Our earnings growth is due primarily to a steeper yield curve that has allowed us to lower deposit rates while mortgage yields have remained stable. As a result, our net interest margin has increased to 1.97% for the second quarter of 2008 from 1.72% for the first quarter of 2008 and 1.64% for the fourth quarter of 2007. Net income for the second quarter of 2008 increased 52% as compared to the second quarter of 2007 and is more than the net income for the full year of 1999  the year we completed our first public offering. These results have allowed us to increase our quarterly cash dividend 50% since the second quarter of 2007."
Mr. Hermance continued, "We continued to grow our balance sheet during the first six months of 2008, increasing our total assets 10.7% to $49.16 billion at June 30, 2008. Our loan portfolio has grown 12.6% since December 31, 2007 to $27.23 billion at June 30, 2008. Mortgage loan applications received through July 21, 2008 have surpassed the application volume for the full calendar year of 2007, which itself was a record year for us. Approximately 49% of these applications are for home purchases and 51% are for the refinancing of mortgages held by other banks. As always, substantially all of our loan production consists of high quality mortgages for owner-occupied residential properties. The average loan-to-value of our 2008 originations is 61%. As always, we do not offer sub-prime loans, negative amortization loans or loans with high loan-to-value ratios without private mortgage insurance. Since we keep all of the loans that we originate in our portfolio, our ability to originate loans is largely unaffected by the turmoil in the secondary mortgage markets. In fact our strong capital and liquidity position allows us to take advantage of a market in turmoil since many of our competitors have liquidity or capital constraints and have reduced their lending operations."
 
Mr. Hermance further commented, "While economic conditions and the housing markets have shown further weakening, our asset quality remains strong. Non-performing loans were $116.3 million or 0.43% of total loans at June 30, 2008. While non-performing loans have increased in recent quarters, our strict underwriting guidelines have helped to moderate loan charge-offs which amounted to $694,000 for the second quarter of 2008. In addition, we invest in mortgage-backed securities and debt securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises. We do not, however, own any common or preferred stock issued by FNMA or FreddieMac."
"We are also proud to have grown deposits by 17.8% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008. We did this organically and in a declining rate environment. So far this year, we have opened 4 new branches and anticipate opening 4 more in the second half of 2008," Mr. Hermance added.
Financial highlights for the second quarter of 2008 are as follows:
 
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $4.74 billion, or 10.7%, to $49.16 billion at June 30, 2008 from $44.42 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in total assets reflected a $3.04 billion increase in loans and a $2.37 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by an $815.2 million decrease in investment securities.
The increase in loans reflected our focus on the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, as well as our continued loan purchase activity. For the first six months of 2008, we originated $2.42 billion and purchased $2.17 billion of loans, compared to originations of $1.60 billion and purchases of $2.37 billion for the first six months of 2007. In addition, commitments to originate and purchase loans amounted to $672.1 million and $203.6 million, respectively, at June 30, 2008 as compared to commitments to originate and purchase loans of $405.9 million and $575.8 million at June 30, 2007. While conditions in the residential housing markets have worsened during 2008, our competitive rates and the decreased mortgage lending competition have resulted in increased origination productivity.
The $2.37 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities reflected purchases of $3.67 billion, which were primarily variable-rate instruments, partially offset by repayments of $1.28 billion.
Total investment securities decreased $815.2 million during the first six months of 2008. Investment securities held to maturity decreased $1.34 billion partially offset by a $521.7 million increase in investment securities available for sale. The decrease was the result of calls of held to maturity and available for sale investment securities of $1.34 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively. The calls were partially offset by purchases of investment securities available for sale of $1.90 billion for the first six months of 2008.
Total liabilities increased $4.64 billion, or 11.7%, to $44.45 billion at June 30, 2008 from $39.81 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $3.34 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $1.57 billion increase in deposits. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of $3.71 billion of new borrowings at a weighted-average rate of 3.01%, partially offset by repayments of $366.0 million with a weighted average rate of 3.93%. The new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates of two to three years. The increase in total deposits reflected a $574.5 million increase in our time deposits, an $849.5 million increase in our money market checking accounts and a $29.3 million increase in our demand accounts.
Total shareholders' equity increased $98.3 million to $4.71 billion at June 30, 2008 from $4.61 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income of $199.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. These increases to shareholders' equity were partially offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders of $96.7 million and repurchases of 224,262 shares of our outstanding common stock in January 2008 at an aggregate cost of $3.6 million. At June 30, 2008, our shareholders' equity to asset ratio was 9.58% and our tangible book value per share was $9.40.
The accumulated other comprehensive loss of $10.2 million at June 30, 2008 includes a $7.0 million after-tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale ($12.0 million pre-tax). We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. We do not purchase unrated or private label mortgage-backed securities or other higher risk securities such as those backed by sub-prime loans. In
 
addition, we do not own any common or preferred stock issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The unrealized loss in the available for sale portfolio at June 30, 2008 was caused by increases in market yields subsequent to purchase and is not attributable to credit quality concerns. There were no debt securities past due or securities for which the Company currently believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security. Because the Company has the intent and the ability to hold securities with unrealized losses until a market price recovery (which, for debt securities may be until maturity), the Company did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at June 30, 2008.
Statement of Income Summary
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank ("FOMC") decreased the overnight lending rate by 225 basis points to 2.00% during the first six months of 2008. The large decrease in the overnight lending rate was in response to the continued liquidity crisis in the credit markets and recessionary concerns. As a result, short-term market interest rates continued to decrease during the first half of 2008. Longer-term market interest rates also decreased during the first six months of 2008, but at a slower pace than the short-term interest rates and, as a result, the yield curve continued to steepen. The sharp decline of short-term interest rates during the first six months resulted in lower deposit costs. As a result, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased from both the second quarter and first six months of 2007.
Net interest income increased $75.4 million, or 47.8%, to $233.1 million for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $157.7 million for the second quarter of 2007. Net interest income increased $112.3 million, or 35.8%, to $426.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared to $314.1 million for the corresponding period in 2007. During the second quarter of 2008, our net interest rate spread increased 46 basis points to 1.56% and our net interest margin increased 32 basis points to 1.97% as compared to the second quarter of 2007. During the first six months of 2008, our net interest rate spread increased 32 basis points to 1.42% and our net interest margin increased 18 basis points to 1.85% as compared to the same period in 2007. For the month of June 2008, our net interest margin was 2.06%.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended June 30, 2008 increased $135.2 million, or 26.4%, to $646.7 million as compared to $511.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $9.03 billion, or 23.8%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $46.95 billion for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $37.92 billion for the second quarter of 2007. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 11 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.51% for the three month period ended June 30, 2008 from 5.40% for the comparable period in 2007.
Total interest and dividend income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 increased $268.8 million, or 27.1%, to $1.26 billion as compared to $991.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to an $8.80 billion, or 23.9%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $45.67 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to $36.87 billion for the corresponding period in 2007. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 14 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.52% for the six months ended June 30, 2008 from 5.38% for the comparable period in 2007.
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $79.3 million to $369.1 million for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $289.8 million for the same period in 2007 primarily due to a $5.27 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of
 
our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a seven basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.74%. Notwithstanding the decrease in long-term market interest rates noted above, mortgage rates have maintained a wider credit spread resulting in higher yields on mortgage loans relative to U.S. Treasury securities.
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $155.9 million to $715.4 million as compared to $559.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 primarily due to a $5.15 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans. The increase in interest income on mortgage loans was also due to an eight basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.75%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $76.2 million to $212.6 million for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $136.4 million for the second quarter of 2007. This increase was due primarily to a $5.63 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities during the second quarter of 2008 as compared to the second quarter of 2007, and a 10 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.21%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $146.7 million to $406.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to $260.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007. This increase was due primarily to a $5.26 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities during the first six months of 2008 as compared to the first six months of 2007, and a 17 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.25%.
The increases in the average balances of mortgage-backed securities were due to purchases of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The increase in the weighted average yields on mortgage-backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities at higher rates than the existing portfolio.
Total interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2008 increased $59.7 million, or 16.9%, to $413.5 million as compared to $353.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007. This increase was primarily due to a $9.13 billion, or 27.7%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $42.13 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 compared with $33.00 billion for the second quarter of 2007. This increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 35 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 3.95% for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 compared with 4.30% for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Total interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2008 increased $156.5 million, or 23.1%, to $833.5 million as compared to $677.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007. This increase was primarily due to a $9.01 billion, or 28.3%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $40.90 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared with $31.89 billion for the corresponding period in 2007. The increase in average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by an 18 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 4.10% for the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared with 4.28% for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
The decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three- and six-month periods in 2008 reflected the decrease in market interest rates during the first quarter of 2008.
 
Interest expense on deposits decreased $5.0 million to $141.4 million for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $146.4 million for the second quarter of 2007. This decrease is due primarily to a 79 basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to 3.58% for the 2008 quarter as compared to 4.37% for the 2007 quarter. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.47 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $15.90 billion during the second quarter of 2008 quarter as compared to $13.43 billion for the comparable period in 2007.
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, interest expense on deposits increased $11.0 million to $299.4 million as compared to $288.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007. This increase is due primarily to a $2.12 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $15.42 billion during the second quarter of 2008 quarter as compared to $13.30 billion for the comparable period in 2007. This increase was partially offset by 46 basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to 3.91% for the six months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to 4.37% for the comparable period in 2007.
The increases in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits reflect our growth strategy. The decrease in the average cost of deposits for the three- and six-month periods reflected lower market interest rates.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $64.7 million to $272.1 million for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $207.4 million for the second quarter of 2007 primarily due to a $6.66 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds. The weighted average cost of borrowed funds decreased 8 basis points to 4.17% for the second quarter of 2008 as compared to 4.25% for the second quarter of 2007.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $145.5 million to $534.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to $388.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 primarily due to a $6.89 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds. The weighted average cost of borrowed funds remained unchanged at 4.22% for the six months ended June 30, 2008.
Borrowed funds were primarily used to fund the growth in interest-earning assets. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with a lower interest rate than existing borrowings and borrowings that were called.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $3.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 as compared to $500,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 and amounted to $5.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to $800,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2007. The provision for loan losses was $4.8 million for the full calendar year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses was due primarily to an increase in non-performing loans and growth in the loan portfolio. Non-performing loans, defined as non-accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, amounted to $116.3 million at June 30, 2008 and $79.4 million at December 31, 2007. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.43% at June 30, 2008 compared with 0.33% at December 31, 2007. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $39.1 million and $34.7 million at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans and non-performing loans was 0.14% and 33.6%, respectively at June 30, 2008 as compared to 0.14% and 43.75%, respectively at December 31, 2007. We recorded net charge-offs of $694,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to net charge-offs of $36,000 for the same period in 2007. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, net charge-offs amounted to $1.2 million as compared to net recoveries of $31,000 for the same period in 2007. The increase in charge-offs was related to non-performing residential mortgage loans for which appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral.
 
Total non-interest income was $2.1 million for the second quarter of 2008 compared with $1.8 million for the second quarter of 2007. Total non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $4.3 million compared with $3.4 million for the comparable period in 2007. The increase in non-interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth.
Total non-interest expense increased $7.4 million, or 18.1%, to $48.3 million for the second quarter of 2008 from $40.9 million for the second quarter of 2007. The increase is primarily due to a $5.5 million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense, a $1.6 million increase in other non-interest expense and a $300,000 increase in net occupancy expense. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense reflected a $3.1 million increase in expense related to our employee stock ownership plan primarily as a result of increases in our stock price and a $1.3 million increase in compensation costs. Included in other non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2008 were write-downs on foreclosed real estate of $430,000 (none in 2007).
Total non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $96.4 million compared with $82.0 million during the corresponding 2007 period. The increase is primarily due to an $11.2 million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense and a $2.6 million increase in other non-interest expense. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense reflected a $6.7 million increase in expense related to our employee stock ownership plan primarily as a result of increases in our stock price and a $2.9 million increase in compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was due primarily to normal salary increases and increased staffing related to our branch expansion strategy. Included in other non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2008 were write-downs on foreclosed real estate of $514,000 (none in 2007).
Our efficiency ratio was 20.52% for the three months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to 25.62% for the three months ended June 30, 2007. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the second quarter of 2008 was 0.41% as compared to 0.42% for the second quarter of 2007. Our efficiency ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was 22.40% compared with 25.82% for the corresponding 2007 period. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was 0.42% compared with 0.44% for the corresponding period in 2007.
Income tax expense amounted to $73.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008 compared with $45.5 million for the corresponding period in 2007. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2008 was 39.82% compared with 38.48% for the corresponding period in 2007. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $129.5 million compared with $90.8 million for the corresponding 2007 period. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was 39.38% compared with 38.69% for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
