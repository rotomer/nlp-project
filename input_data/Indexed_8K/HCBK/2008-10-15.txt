Exhibit 99.1
RELEASE 8:00AM  OCTOBER 15, 2008
Paramus, New Jersey, October 15, 2008  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today that net income for the third quarter of 2008 increased 63.8% to $121.9 million as compared to $74.4 million for the third quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share increased 66.7% to $0.25 for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $0.15 for the third quarter of 2007. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net income increased 47.1% to $321.3 million as compared to $218.4 million for the same period in 2007. Diluted earnings per share increased 54.8% to $0.65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to $0.42 for the same period in 2007. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share, an increase of 62.5% from the quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 for third quarter of 2007.
A statement from Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, regarding the third quarter's results, is attached to this press release and is incorporated herein by reference.
Financial highlights for the third quarter of 2008 are as follows:
 
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $7.35 billion, or 16.5%, to $51.77 billion at September 30, 2008 from $44.42 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in total assets reflected a $4.32 billion increase in loans and a $3.50 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by an $865.3 million decrease in investment securities.
The increase in loans reflected our focus on the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, as well as our continued loan purchase activity. For the first nine months of 2008, we originated $4.01 billion and purchased $2.55 billion of loans, compared to originations of $2.65 billion and purchases of $3.06 billion for the first nine months of 2007. While the residential real estate markets have weakened considerably during the past year, our competitive rates and the decreased mortgage lending competition have resulted in increased origination productivity for the first nine months of 2008.
The $3.50 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities reflected purchases of $5.34 billion, which were primarily variable-rate instruments, partially offset by repayments of $1.84 billion.
Total investment securities decreased $865.3 million during the first nine months of 2008. Investment securities held to maturity decreased $1.36 billion partially offset by a $493.1 million increase in investment securities available for sale. The decrease was the result of calls of held to maturity and available for sale investment securities of $1.36 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively. The calls were partially offset by purchases of investment securities available for sale of $1.90 billion for the first nine months of 2008.
Total liabilities increased $7.18 billion, or 18.0%, to $46.99 billion at September 30, 2008 from $39.81 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $5.14 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $2.14 billion increase in deposits. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of $5.50 billion of new borrowings at a weighted-average rate of 3.12%, partially offset by repayments of $366.0 million with a weighted average rate of 3.93%. The new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates of one to three years. The increase in total deposits reflected a $1.17 billion
 
increase in our time deposits, a $957.6 million increase in our money market checking accounts and a $40.8 million increase in our demand accounts.
Total shareholders' equity increased $174.8 million to $4.79 billion at September 30, 2008 from $4.61 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income of $321.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008. This increase to shareholders' equity was partially offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders of $154.8 million and repurchases of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $3.6 million. At September 30, 2008, our shareholders' equity to asset ratio was 9.24% and our tangible book value per share was $9.52.
The accumulated other comprehensive loss of $18.5 million at September 30, 2008 includes a $15.3 million after-tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale ($25.9 million pre-tax). We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other securities issued by U.S. governmentsponsored enterprises. We do not purchase unrated or private label mortgage-backed securities or other higher risk securities such as those backed by sub-prime loans. In addition, we do not own any common or preferred stock issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The unrealized loss in the available for sale portfolio at September 30, 2008 was caused by increases in market yields subsequent to purchase and is not attributable to credit quality concerns. There were no debt securities past due or securities for which the Company currently believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security. Because the Company has the intent and the ability to hold securities with unrealized losses until a market price recovery (which, for debt securities may be until maturity), the Company did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2008.
Statement of Income Summary
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank ("FOMC") decreased the overnight lending rate by 225 basis points during the first nine months of 2008 to 2.00%. This followed a 50 basis point reduction in the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, the FOMC reduced the overnight lending rate in October 2008 by an additional 50 basis points to 1.50%. The large decrease in the overnight lending rate was in response to the continued liquidity crisis in the credit markets and recessionary concerns. As a result, short-term market interest rates decreased during the first nine months of 2008. Longer-term market interest rates also decreased during the first nine months of 2008, but at a slower pace than the short-term interest rates. As a result, the yield curve continued to steepen. Notwithstanding the decrease in long-term market interest rates noted above, mortgage rates have maintained a wider credit spread resulting in higher yields on mortgage loans relative to U.S. Treasury securities. However, the sharp decline of short-term interest rates during the first nine months of 2008 resulted in lower deposit costs. As a result, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased from both the third quarter and first nine months of 2007.
Net interest income increased $92.9 million, or 57.3%, to $255.1 million for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $162.2 million for the third quarter of 2007. Net interest income increased $205.2 million, or 43.1%, to $681.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared to $476.3 million for the corresponding period in 2007. During the third quarter of 2008, our net interest rate spread increased 56 basis points to 1.70% and our net interest margin increased 43 basis points to 2.08% as compared to the third quarter of 2007. During the first nine months of 2008, our net interest rate spread increased 41 basis points to 1.52% and our net interest margin increased 27 basis points to 1.93% as compared to the same period in 2007.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended September 30, 2008 increased $133.1 million, or 24.3%, to $681.3 million as compared to $548.2 million for the three months ended September
 
30, 2007. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $9.41 billion, or 23.5%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $49.52 billion for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $40.11 billion for the third quarter of 2007. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 3 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.50% for the three month period ended September 30, 2008 from 5.47% for the comparable period in 2007.
Total interest and dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased $401.9 million, or 26.1%, to $1.94 billion as compared to $1.54 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $9.01 billion, or 23.7%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $46.97 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to $37.96 billion for the corresponding period in 2007. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 10 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.51% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 from 5.41% for the comparable period in 2007.
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $80.8 million to $394.7 million for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $313.9 million for the same period in 2007 primarily due to a $5.44 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $27.43 billion as compared to $21.99 billion for the second quarter of 2007, which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a 5 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.76%. Notwithstanding the decrease in long-term market interest rates noted above, mortgage rates have maintained a wider credit spread resulting in higher yields on mortgage loans relative to U.S. Treasury securities.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $236.7 million to $1.11 billion as compared to $873.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 primarily due to a $5.25 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $25.74 billion as compared to $20.49 billion for same period in 2007. The increase in interest income on mortgage loans was also due to a 7 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.75%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $74.2 million to $225.3 million for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $151.1 million for the third quarter of 2007. This increase was due primarily to a $5.67 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities to $17.29 billion during the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $11.62 billion for the third quarter of 2007, and a 1 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.21%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $220.9 million to $632.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to $411.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. This increase was due primarily to a $5.40 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities to $16.11 billion during the first nine months of 2008 as compared to $10.70 billion for the same period in 2007, and an 11 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.23%.
The increases in the average balances of mortgage-backed securities were due to purchases of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed-rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The increase in the weighted average yields on mortgage-backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities when market interest rates were higher than the yield earned on the existing portfolio.
 
Total interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2008 increased $40.2 million, or 10.4%, to $426.2 million as compared to $386.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007. This increase was primarily due to a $9.29 billion, or 26.3%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $44.63 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 compared with $35.34 billion for the third quarter of 2007. This increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 53 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 3.80% for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 compared with 4.33% for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.
Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased $196.7 million, or 18.6%, to $1.26 billion as compared to $1.06 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. This increase was primarily due to a $9.10 billion, or 27.5%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $42.16 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $33.06 billion for the corresponding period in 2007. The increase in average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 31 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 3.99% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with 4.30% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.
The decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three- and nine-month periods in 2008 reflected the decrease in market interest rates during the first nine months of 2008.
Interest expense on deposits decreased $21.1 million to $134.0 million for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $155.1 million for the third quarter of 2007. This decrease is due primarily to a 116 basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to 3.28% for the 2008 quarter as compared to 4.44% for the 2007 quarter. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.41 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $16.26 billion during the third quarter of 2008 quarter as compared to $13.85 billion for the comparable period in 2007.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, interest expense on deposits decreased $10.1 million to $433.4 million as compared to $443.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. This decrease is due primarily to a 71 basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to 3.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to 4.40% for the comparable period in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.21 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $15.70 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to $13.49 billion for the comparable period in 2007.
The increases in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits reflect our growth strategy. The decrease in the average cost of deposits for the three- and nine-month periods reflected lower market interest rates.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $61.4 million to $292.3 million for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to $230.9 million for the third quarter of 2007 primarily due to a $6.87 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $28.37 billion. The weighted average cost of borrowed funds decreased 16 basis points to 4.10% for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to 4.26% for the third quarter of 2007.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $206.7 million to $826.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to $619.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 primarily due to a $6.89 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $26.46 billion. The weighted average cost of borrowed funds decreased 6 basis points to 4.17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to 4.23% for the comparable period in 2007.
 
Borrowed funds were primarily used to fund the growth in interest-earning assets. The decrease in the average cost of borrowings for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008 reflected new borrowings in 2008, when market interest rates were lower than existing borrowings, and borrowings that were called. Substantially all of our borrowings are callable quarterly at the discretion of the lender after an initial non-call period of one to five years with a final maturity of ten years. Based on the lower market interest rates as of September 30, 2008, we anticipate that none of the borrowings with call dates in 2008 will be called.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $5.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 as compared to $2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 and amounted to $10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. The provision for loan losses was $4.8 million for the full calendar year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses was due primarily to an increase in non-performing loans and growth in the loan portfolio. Non-performing loans, defined as non-accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, amounted to $142.1 million at September 30, 2008 and $79.4 million at December 31, 2007. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.50% at September 30, 2008 compared with 0.33% at December 31, 2007. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $42.6 million and $34.7 million at September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans and non-performing loans was 0.15% and 29.99%, respectively at September 30, 2008 as compared to 0.14% and 43.75%, respectively at December 31, 2007. We recorded net charge-offs of $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to net charge-offs of $606,000 for the same period in 2007. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net charge-offs amounted to $2.6 million as compared to net charge-offs of $575,000 for the same period in 2007. The increase in charge-offs was related primarily to non-performing residential mortgage loans for which appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral.
Total non-interest income was $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared with $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2007. Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $6.5 million compared with $5.4 million for the comparable period in 2007. The increase in non-interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth.
Total non-interest expense increased $8.2 million, or 19.9%, to $49.4 million for the third quarter of 2008 from $41.2 million for the third quarter of 2007. The increase is primarily due to a $5.5 million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense, a $2.2 million increase in other non-interest expense and a $540,000 increase in Federal deposit insurance expense. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense included a $1.9 million increase in expense related to our employee stock ownership plan primarily as a result of increases in our stock price and a $1.9 million increase in compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was due primarily to normal salary increases and increased staffing related to our branch expansion strategy. Included in other non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2008 were write-downs and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate of $516,000 compared with net gains on the sale of foreclosed real estate of $31,000 for the comparable period in 2007.
Total non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $145.8 million compared with $123.2 million during the corresponding 2007 period. The increase is primarily due to a $16.8 million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense and a $4.9 million increase in other non-interest expense. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense reflected an $8.5 million increase in expense related to our employee stock ownership plan primarily as a result of increases in our stock price and a $4.8 million increase in compensation costs. Included in other non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 were write-downs
 
and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate of $1.1 million compared with net gains on the sale of foreclosed real estate of $6,000 for the comparable period in 2007.
Our efficiency ratio was 19.21% for the three months ended September 30, 2008 as compared to 25.07% for the three months ended September 30, 2007. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the third quarter of 2008 was 0.39% as compared to 0.40% for the third quarter of 2007. Our efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was 21.21% compared with 25.56% for the corresponding 2007 period. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was 0.41% compared with 0.43% for the corresponding period in 2007.
Income tax expense amounted to $80.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008 compared with $46.6 million for the corresponding period in 2007. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2008 was 39.90% compared with 38.52% for the corresponding period in 2007. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $210.4 million compared with $137.4 million for the corresponding 2007 period. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was 39.58% compared with 38.63% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.

     After the worst week in history for the stock market, we decided to accelerate our earnings announcement in order to bring you some good news.
     Hudson City finished the third quarter with record earnings of $121.9 million or $0.25 per share versus last year's third quarter earnings of $74.4 million or $0.15 per share. In fact, our earnings per share for the first three quarters of the year of $0.65 per share surpasses our entire total for the year 2007 which was $0.58 per share. We are on pace to have our tenth straight record year of earnings against a backdrop of tremendous chaos in the financial world.
     It is evident that our conservative model that emphasizes the underwriting of each individual loan application and tremendous system-wide cost control, while averaging 20% annual average asset growth over the last ten years, has been successful.
Performance Measures
     As you probably remember, we became a fully-public company in June 2005 when we issued the remaining 53% of our common stock and raised $3.9 billion of capital. During the third quarter of 2008, we were able to generate a 10.19% return on average equity and a 0.97% return on average assets. Both of these achievements occurred much sooner than we had forecast.
Capital and Liquidity
     We remain well capitalized with an equity to asset ratio of 9.24%  among the highest in the industry for institutions over $50 billion in assets. Our risk-based capital is 21.87%.
     Our securities portfolio consists of either U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or mortgage-backed securities with an implied government guarantee which offer us, in addition to a mortgage portfolio, excellent collateral for liquidity. In addition, as a result of the turmoil affecting many of our competitors, we have added better than $2.1 billion in deposits through the first nine months of 2008, which is also a record.
 
Loan Portfolio
     Through the first three quarters of 2008, our retail mortgage applications have surpassed the application volume for the full calendar year of 2007, which itself was a record year for us. About 54% of these applications were for home purchases in our primary market which is the New York metropolitan area.
     Our non-accrual loans went from 328 units as of June 30, 2008 to 386 units at September 30, 2008 out of 81,949 loans which represents 0.5% of total loans. We charged-off $1.4 million and recorded a provision for loan losses of $5.0 million for the quarter which we felt was prudent. During the last five quarters, we have provided $14.5 million to the loan loss reserve and charged-off $3.3 million. It is important to note that our loan portfolio still averages a 61% loan-to-value ratio based on appraised values at the time of origination.
Growth and Overhead
     Before the end of the year we will have added eight new branches for a total of 127. At the same time, we have improved our efficiency ratio to 19.21% which is the best ratio among the top 50 banks in the country based on asset size.
Objectives
     We believe we can continue to take market share and grow organically at a strong pace while not compromising asset quality. This growth will come in our traditional product offerings and with our strong commitment to asset quality.
     As always, we keep shareholder value as our highest objective. We are proud that we increased our quarterly cash dividend to $0.13 per share  this marks the 4 consecutive dividend increase at a time when other financial institutions are cutting dividends to survive.
th
     Our customers can remain confident in our financial strength and our commitment to our motto  "". This motto captures our philosophy of customer service. We look forward to serving our customers needs as they seek out a safe harbor from the turmoil in the financial marketplace.
Bank on Better Values
     We are pleased with your commitment to ownership of Hudson City and will strive to honor your continued confidence in Hudson City Bancorp, Inc.
