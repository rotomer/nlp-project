Exhibit 99.1
RELEASE 8:00AM  JANUARY 21, 2009
Paramus, New Jersey, January 21, 2009  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today that net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 60.4% to $124.3 million, a record for Hudson City, as compared to $77.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share increased 56.3% to $0.25 for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $0.16 for the fourth quarter of 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, net income increased 50.6% to $445.6 million as compared to $295.9 million for 2007. Diluted earnings per share increased 55.2% to $0.90 for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $0.58 for 2007. The Board of Directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share, an increase of 55.6% from the quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 declared for the fourth quarter of 2007.
Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "These certainly are difficult economic times. At the very least, 2008 will be remembered as a year that saw our economy fall into a deep recession and a year that witnessed unprecedented turmoil and changes in the financial marketplace. Despite these unpleasant events, Hudson City is reporting record results. We continue to stand apart from our competitors as we never engaged in risky lending practices. We are delighted with our earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008, which increased 60% over the same quarter last year and our earnings for calendar 2008 increased over 50% from 2007. We reached other milestones in 2008  our loan production in 2008 was a record for Hudson City as was our deposit growth. In addition, we increased our dividend in January 2009 for the 5 consecutive quarter and we have paid a cash dividend every quarter since our initial public offering in 1999. In fact, our dividends have grown at a compounded annual rate of over 59% since that time. These successes are due in large part to our continued focus on our business model as a conservative and efficient thrift. While our non-performing assets increased during 2008, our conservative underwriting principles have helped us to mitigate charge-offs which amounted to only $4.4 million in 2008."
th
Mr. Hermance continued, "In the fourth quarter of 2008, we grew deposits by $1.18 billion, capping a full year of deposit growth of $3.31 billion, as depositors looked for competitive rates and a bank with a strong capital position. We introduced our internet deposit product in December 2008 and although we have not yet fully implemented our marketing plan for this product, we have already taken in over $52 million of deposits through this channel. We are very excited about the prospects of increasing deposit funding nationally through the internet with the same competitive rates and brand our customers enjoy in our physical branch network. We believe that our retail branch network coupled with our internet deposit products will further enhance the value of our franchise."
 
Mr. Hermance further commented, "While we have grown at an annual compounded growth rate of over 20% since our 1999 offering, we recognize that our growth in 2009 may be affected by the current economic conditions. However, we believe that 2009 will present many opportunities for us. While mortgage rates have decreased for conforming loans, rates for our primary product, jumbo mortgage loans, should still provide attractive returns. We will remain competitive in the marketplace for these loans and we believe that the reduced number of lenders will continue to fuel our mortgage growth. We believe that the conditions in the financial markets may also provide us with an opportunity to repurchase our shares as an alternative to either growth or to available asset yields for securities we would normally purchase. In the fourth quarter we seized on market conditions to repurchase 900,000 shares of our common stock for the first time since January 2008. We currently have over 54 million shares available for repurchase under existing programs."
Mr. Hermance concluded, "In 2008, Hudson City was the best performing bank in the S&P 500 with a total return of 9.02 %. Hudson City was also selected to be honored by the Foreign Policy Association for its 2008 Corporate Responsibility Award. Finally, Forbes added Hudson City to its Platinum 400 list of Best Big Companies in America and also named Hudson City the "Best-Managed Bank of 2008" for the second year in a row. I am proud of the hard work and success of our staff and humbled by the significance of these awards."
Financial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2008 are as follows:
 
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $9.74 billion, or 21.9%, to $54.16 billion at December 31, 2008 from $44.42 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in total assets reflected a $5.24 billion increase in loans and a $4.92 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by a $710.3 million decrease in investment securities.
The increase in loans reflected our focus on the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, as well as our continued loan purchase activity. During 2008, we originated $5.04 billion and purchased $3.06 billion of loans, compared to originations of $3.35 billion and purchases of $3.97 billion in 2007. While the residential real estate markets have weakened considerably during the past year, our competitive rates and the decreased mortgage lending competition have resulted in increased origination productivity.
The $4.92 billion increase in total mortgage-backed securities reflected purchases of $7.18 billion, which were primarily variable-rate instruments, partially offset by repayments of $2.31 billion.
Total investment securities decreased $710.3 million to $3.46 billion at December 31, 2008. Investment securities held to maturity decreased $1.36 billion partially offset by a $648.1 million increase in investment securities available for sale. The decrease was the result of calls of held to maturity and available for sale investment securities of $1.36 billion and $1.45 billion, respectively. The calls were partially offset by purchases of investment securities available for sale of $2.10 billion.
Total liabilities increased $9.40 billion, or 23.6%, to $49.21 billion at December 31, 2008 from $39.81 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $6.09 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $3.31 billion increase in deposits. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of $6.65 billion of new borrowings at a weighted-average rate of 2.99%, partially offset by repayments of $566.0 million with a weighted average rate of 3.05%. The new borrowings primarily have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates of one to three years. During 2008, we also borrowed $600 million with maturities of less than one year. The increase in total deposits reflected a $2.21 billion increase in our time deposits and a $1.14 billion increase in our money market checking accounts.
Total shareholders' equity increased $338.2 million to $4.95 billion at December 31, 2008 from $4.61 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income of $445.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and a $41.7 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. This increase to shareholders' equity was partially offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders of
 
$218.0 million. At December 31, 2008, our shareholders' equity to asset ratio was 9.14% and our tangible book value per share was $9.80.
The accumulated other comprehensive income of $58.3 million at December 31, 2008 includes a $74.6 million after-tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale ($126.1 million pre-tax). We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other securities issued by U.S. governmentsponsored enterprises. We do not purchase unrated or private label mortgage-backed securities or other higher risk securities such as those backed by sub-prime loans. In addition, we do not own any common or preferred stock issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. There were no debt securities past due or securities for which the Company currently believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security.
Statement of Income Summary
During 2008, the national economy continued to falter with particular emphasis on the deterioration of the housing and real estate markets. During the fourth quarter of 2008, it became widely accepted that the United States economy had entered a recession by the first quarter of 2008. The faltering economy has been marked by contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit, increases in borrowing rates, falling home prices and increasing levels of home foreclosures and unemployment. In response, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank ("FOMC") decreased the overnight lending rate by 400 to 425 basis points during 2008 to a target rate of 0.00% to 0.25%. This unprecedented decrease in the overnight lending rate was in response to the continued liquidity crisis in the credit markets as well as an attempt to stimulate the housing markets and the overall economy. As a result, short-term market interest rates decreased during 2008. The sharp decline in short-term interest rates during 2008 lowered our deposit and borrowing costs. Longer-term market interest rates also decreased during 2008, but at a slower pace than short-term interest rates and, as a result, the yield curve continued to steepen. Notwithstanding the decrease in long-term market interest rates noted above, mortgage rates maintained a wider credit spread relative to U.S. Treasury securities resulting in higher yields on our mortgage loans. As a result, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased from both the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2007. Recent actions by the Federal Reserve to purchase securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have resulted in a decrease in mortgage rates late in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into January 2009.
Net interest income increased $89.6 million, or 52.4%, to $260.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $170.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Net interest income increased $294.8 million, or 45.6%, to $942.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $647.2 million for 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2008, our net interest rate spread increased 51 basis points to 1.67% and our net interest margin increased 38 basis points to 2.02% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. During 2008, our net interest rate spread increased 46 basis points to 1.57% and our net interest margin increased 31 basis points to 1.96% as compared to 2007.
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended December 31, 2008 increased $123.8 million, or 21.0%, to $712.0 million as compared to $588.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $9.41 billion, or 22.1%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $51.98 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $42.57 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in interest and dividend income was partially offset by a decrease of 5 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.48% for the three month period ended December 31, 2008 from 5.53% for the comparable period in 2007.
 
Total interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $525.7 million, or 24.7%, to $2.65 billion as compared to $2.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to an $8.88 billion, or 22.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $48.10 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $39.22 billion for the corresponding period in 2007. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 10 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.52% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 5.42% for 2007.
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $81.3 million to $413.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $332.1 million for the same period in 2007 primarily due to a $5.43 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $28.56 billion as compared to $23.13 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007, which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a 5 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.79%. Notwithstanding the decrease in long-term market interest rates noted above, mortgage rates have maintained a wider credit spread resulting in higher yields on mortgage loans relative to U.S. Treasury securities.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $318.1 million to $1.52 billion as compared to $1.21 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to a $5.17 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $26.38 billion as compared to $21.21 billion for 2007. The increase in interest income on mortgage loans was also due to a 10 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.78%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $66.2 million to $242.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $176.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase was due primarily to a $5.30 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities to $18.62 billion during the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $13.32 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase was partially offset by a 9 basis point decrease in the weighted-average yield to 5.21%. The decrease in the yield during the quarter is a result of the decrease in market rates.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $287.1 million to $875.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $587.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was due primarily to a $5.30 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities to $16.69 billion during 2008 as compared to $11.39 billion for 2007, and an 8 basis point increase in the weighted-average yield to 5.24%.
The increases in the average balances of mortgage-backed securities were due to purchases of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since a substantial portion of our loan production consists of fixed-rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable-rate mortgage-backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The increase in the weighted average yields for 2008 on mortgage-backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities during the second half of 2007 and the first half of 2008 when market interest rates were higher than the yield earned on the existing portfolio.
Dividends on FHLB stock decreased $5.4 million or 42.5% to $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $12.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease was due to a 408 basis point decrease in the average yield earned to 3.45% as compared to 7.53% for the fourth quarter of 2007. The decrease in the average yield earned was partially offset by a $173.2 million increase in the average balance to $845.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $671.9 million for the same quarter in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, dividends on FHLB stock increased $8.5 million
 
or 21.5% to $48.0 million as compared to $39.5 million for 2007. This increase was due to a $204.3 million increase in the average balance to $790.3 million for 2008 as compared to $586.0 million for 2007. This increase was partially offset by a 67 basis point decrease in the average yield earned to 6.07% as compared to 6.74% for 2007.
Total interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2008 increased $34.2 million, or 8.2%, to $451.5 million as compared to $417.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to a $9.21 billion, or 24.3%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $47.09 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 compared with $37.88 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 56 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 3.81% for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 compared with 4.37% for the quarter ended December 31, 2007.
Total interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $230.9 million, or 15.6%, to $1.71 billion as compared to $1.48 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to an $8.92 billion, or 26.0%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $43.28 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with $34.36 billion for the corresponding period in 2007. The increase in average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 36 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 3.95% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with 4.31% for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Interest expense on deposits decreased $15.5 million to $148.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $163.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease is due primarily to a 110 basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to 3.39% for the 2008 quarter as compared to 4.49% for the 2007 quarter. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.93 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $17.37 billion during the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $14.44 billion for the comparable period in 2007.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense on deposits decreased $25.5 million to $581.4 million as compared to $606.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease is due primarily to a 79 basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to 3.62% for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 4.41% for the comparable period in 2007. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.32 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $16.08 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $13.76 billion for 2007.
The increases in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits reflect our growth strategy. In addition, we believe the turmoil in the credit and equity markets have made deposit products in strong financial institutions desirable for many customers. The decrease in the average cost of deposits for the three- and twelve-month periods reflected lower market interest rates. At December 31, 2008, time deposits scheduled to mature within one year totaled $12.48 billion with an average cost of 3.61%.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $49.7 million to $303.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $253.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily due to a $6.27 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $29.71 billion as compared to $23.44 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007. The weighted average cost of borrowed funds decreased 24 basis points to 4.06% for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to 4.30% for the fourth quarter of 2007.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $256.5 million to $1.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $873.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to
 
a $6.61 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $27.20 billion as compared to $20.59 billion in 2007. The weighted average cost of borrowed funds decreased 9 basis points to 4.15% for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 4.24% for 2007.
Borrowed funds were used to fund a significant portion of the growth in interest-earning assets. The decrease in the average cost of borrowings for the three- and twelve-month periods reflected new borrowings in 2008, when market interest rates were lower than existing borrowings and borrowings that were called. Substantially all of our borrowings are callable quarterly at the discretion of the lender after an initial non-call period of one to five years with a final maturity of ten years. We anticipate that none of the borrowings will be called in 2009 assuming that market interest rates remain at current levels.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $9.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $2.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 and amounted to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses was due primarily to an increase in non-performing loans and growth in the loan portfolio. Non-performing loans, defined as non-accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, amounted to $217.6 million at December 31, 2008 and $79.4 million at December 31, 2007. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.74% at December 31, 2008 compared with 0.33% at December 31, 2007. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $49.8 million and $34.7 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans and non-performing loans was 0.17% and 22.89%, respectively at December 31, 2008, as compared to 0.14% and 43.75%, respectively at December 31, 2007. We recorded net charge-offs of $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to net charge-offs of $109,000 for the same period in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, net charge-offs amounted to $4.4 million as compared to net charge-offs of $684,000 for 2007. The increase in charge-offs was related primarily to non-performing residential mortgage loans for which appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral.
Total non-interest income was $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $8.5 million compared with $7.3 million for 2007. The increase in non-interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth.
Total non-interest expense increased $7.5 million, or 16.7%, to $52.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 from $44.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase is primarily due to a $3.8 million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense, a $2.1 million increase in Federal deposit insurance expense and a $945,000 increase in other non-interest expense. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense included a $1.6 million increase in compensation costs, due primarily to normal increases in salary and additional full time employees for our new branches, and a $601,000 increase in stock option plan expense. At December 31, 2008, we had 1,451 full-time equivalent employees as compared to 1,307 at December 31, 2007. The increase in the Federal deposit insurance expense is the result of an assessment credit that was used to offset our 2007 deposit insurance assessment. Included in other non-interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2008 were write downs on foreclosed real estate and net losses from the sale of foreclosed real estate of $218,000 as compared to $157,000 for the fourth quarter of 2007.
Total non-interest expense increased $30.2 million, or 18.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $198.1 million compared with $167.9 million during 2007. The increase is primarily due to a $20.6 million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense, a $2.6 million increase in Federal deposit insurance expense and a $5.9 million increase in other non-interest expense. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense included an $8.4 million increase in expense related to our
 
employee stock ownership plan primarily as a result of increases in our stock price and a $6.3 million increase in compensation costs, due primarily to normal increases in salary and additional full time employees for our new branches, and a $2.3 million increase in stock option plan expense. The increase in the Federal deposit insurance expense is the result of an assessment credit that was used to offset 100% of our 2007 deposit insurance assessment of $7.3 million. At January 1, 2008, we had a remaining assessment credit of $3.3 million which was used to offset a portion of our 2008 deposit insurance. Included in other non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 were write-downs on foreclosed real estate and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate, of $1.3 million as compared to $112,000 for 2007.
Our efficiency ratio was 19.91% for the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 25.92% for the three months ended December 31, 2007. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 0.40% as compared to 0.41% for the fourth quarter of 2007. Our efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 20.84% compared with 25.66% for 2007. Our ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 0.41% compared with 0.42% for 2007.
Income tax expense amounted to $76.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $48.4 million for the corresponding period in 2007. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2008 was 38.23% as compared to 38.46% for the corresponding period in 2007. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $287.3 million as compared to $185.9 million for 2007. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 39.21% as compared to 38.59% for the year ended December 31, 2007.
