Exhibit 99.1
RELEASE 8:00AM  July 21, 2009
Paramus, New Jersey, July 21, 2009  Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank, reported today that net income for the second quarter of 2009 increased 15.5% to $127.9 million as compared to $110.7 million for the second quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share increased 18.2% to $0.26 for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $0.22 for the second quarter of 2008. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, net income increased 28.2% to $255.6 million as compared to $199.4 million for the same period in 2008. Diluted earnings per share increased 30.0% to $0.52 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $0.40 for the same period in 2008. Net interest margin widened to 2.17% for the second quarter of 2009 from 2.06% for the linked first quarter of 2009 and from 1.56% for the second quarter of 2008. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable to shareholders of record on August 7, 2009.
Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, "We posted very strong earnings this quarter despite headwinds from the FDIC special assessment of $21.1 million and an increased loan loss provision. We increased our provision for loan losses to $32.5 million for the second quarter from $20.0 million for the first quarter of 2009. The second quarter provision reflected the increase in non-performing loans as economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels, continued to deteriorate. We charged-off $9.6 million during the second quarter. Substantially all of these charge-offs were for non-performing loans with updated collateral values that were less than the mortgage amount. These loans are still in the foreclosure process, which can take almost thirty months to complete. While charge-offs are increasing, our losses to date have been modest since we are in a first lien position and also due to our relatively low average loan-to-value ratios at origination. We are recognizing these losses in a proactive fashion based on updated collateral values that we obtain when a mortgage loan becomes 180 days delinquent. These loans may or may not eventually become owned real estate."
Mr. Hermance continued, "We continued our strong deposit growth with an increase of $1.3 billion in deposits this quarter. This deposit growth came as our deposit costs decreased 55 basis points to 2.43% from the linked first quarter of 2009. For the first half of 2009, our deposits grew by 17.5%. This trend is continuing in July with over $600.0 million of deposit growth through July 17th. We also continued to grow our loan portfolio during the quarter by originating $1.7 billion and purchasing $1.2 billion of first mortgage loans. Our loan production was subject to our usual strict underwriting and purchasing guidelines. We do not sacrifice asset quality to generate loan production. We funded the loan purchases with deposit growth and the sale of $761.6 million of securities available-for-sale which resulted in a gain of $24.0 million. We decided to use securities sales as a funding source because the yields on the purchased loans were similar to those of the securities sold and we believe that if we held the securities, the unrealized gains would diminish since prepayment speeds are relatively high. After this sale, which did not result in any loss of yield, we still had an unrealized gain in our available-for-sale securities portfolio of $300.3 million. In addition, we had an unrealized gain in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio of $271.3 million."
 
Mr. Hermance further commented, "July 13 marked the tenth anniversary of our initial public offering. If you bought shares in our IPO, your cost basis would be $1.56 and we have returned more than that to our shareholders in dividends alone. As I reflect on our time as a public company, the unprecedented events occurring in the financial and housing markets and the economic conditions of the past two years have certainly posed many challenges. And yet, Hudson City continues to thrive. We have posted ten years of earnings growth, asset growth and uninterrupted dividend payments. We have grown our branch network from 75 branches in New Jersey to 131 branches in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. We are also celebrating another milestone in our history  our Clifton, New Jersey branch now has over $500 million of deposits. I would like to thank the staff of the Clifton branch and our customers for their loyalty. All of these accomplishments were possible because we put to work the capital that our stockholders entrusted to us. We deployed this capital by remaining dedicated to our simple thrift business model and our "tried and true" lending philosophy. On behalf of all of us at Hudson City, I thank you for your support and confidence."
th
Financial highlights for the second quarter of 2009 are as follows:
 
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets increased $3.26 billion, or 6.0%, to $57.41 billion at June 30, 2009 from $54.15 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase in total assets reflected a $1.28 billion increase in loans, a $1.04 billion increase in investment securities, and a $631.6 million increase in total mortgage-backed securities.
The increase in loans reflected our focus on the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, as well as our continued loan purchase activity. For the first six months of 2009, we originated $2.97 billion and purchased $1.88 billion of loans, compared to originations of $2.42 billion and purchases of $2.17 billion for the first six months of 2008. The origination and purchases of loans were partially offset by principal repayments of $3.50 billion for the first six months of 2009 as compared to $1.54 billion for the comparable period in 2008. Loan originations have increased due primarily to our competitive rates and an increase in mortgage refinancing caused by market interest rates that are at near-historic lows. The increase in refinancing activity occurring in the marketplace has also caused the increase in principal repayments during the first six months of 2009.
Total investment securities increased $1.04 billion during the first six months of 2009. The increase in investment securities is primarily due to purchases of $3.38 billion, partially offset by calls of investment securities of $2.27 billion. Total mortgage-backed securities increased $631.6 million during the first six months of 2009, reflecting purchases of $3.16 billion partially offset by repayments of $1.94 billion and sales of $761.6 million. The sales of the mortgage-backed securities resulted in a net gain of $24.0 million. We used the proceeds from the securities sales to fund the purchase of first mortgage loans. We decided to use securities sales as a funding source because the yields on the purchased loans were similar to those of the securities sold and we believe that if we held the securities, the unrealized gains would diminish since prepayment speeds are relatively high. We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities and other securities issued by U.S. governmentsponsored enterprises. There were no debt or equity securities past due or securities for which the Company currently believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security.
Total liabilities increased $3.05 billion, or 6.2%, to $52.26 billion at June 30, 2009 from $49.21 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $3.23 billion increase in deposits, partially offset by a $200.0 million decrease in borrowed funds. The increase in total deposits reflected a $1.90 billion increase in our time deposits, a $986.1 million increase in our money market checking accounts and a $237.6 million increase in our interest-bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts. The decrease in borrowed funds was the result of repayments of $950.0 million with a weighted average rate of 1.63% largely offset by $750.0 million of new borrowings at a weighted-average rate of 1.69%. During the second quarter of 2009, we modified $300.0 million of borrowings to extend the maturity and call dates of the borrowings by between two and three years. The underlying interest rates remained unchanged. Due to brokers amounted to $250.0 million as compared to $239.1 million at December 31, 2008. Due to brokers at June 30, 2009 represents securities purchased in the second quarter of 2009 with settlement dates in the third quarter of 2009.
Total shareholders' equity increased $204.5 million to $5.14 billion at June 30, 2009 from $4.94 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to net income of $255.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and a $102.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. These increases to shareholders' equity were partially offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders of
 
$141.4 million. At June 30, 2009, our shareholders' equity to asset ratio was 8.96% and our tangible book value per share was $10.21.
The accumulated other comprehensive income of $149.7 million at June 30, 2009 includes a $177.6 million after-tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale ($300.3 million pre-tax) partially offset by a $27.9 million after-tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the funded status of our employee benefit plans.
Statement of Income Summary
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank (the "FOMC") noted that there is evidence that the pace of economic contraction has slowed since April 2009. However, the national unemployment rate increased to 9.5% in June 2009 as compared to 8.5% in March 2009 and 7.2% in December 2008. Lower household wealth and tight credit conditions in addition to the increase in the national unemployment rate has resulted in the FOMC maintaining the overnight lending rate at zero to 0.25% during the second quarter of 2009. As a result, short-term market interest rates have remained at low levels during the second quarter of 2009. This allowed us to continue to re-price our short-term deposits thereby reducing our cost of funds. While longer-term market interest rates increased during the second quarter of 2009, rates on mortgage-related assets have declined slightly, although to a lesser extent than the decline in our cost of funds. As a result, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased from the first quarter of 2009 as well as from the second quarter of 2008.
Net interest income increased $69.3 million, or 29.7%, to $302.4 million for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $233.1 million for the second quarter of 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, our net interest rate spread increased 31 basis points to 1.87%, as compared to 1.56% for the same quarter in 2008. Our net interest margin increased 20 basis points to 2.17% as compared to 1.97% for the second quarter of 2008. Net interest income increased $159.8 million, or 37.5%, to $586.2 million for the first six months of 2009 as compared to $426.4 million for the first six months of 2008. During the first six months of 2009, our net interest rate spread increased 37 basis points to 1.79% and our net interest margin increased 26 basis points to 2.11% as compared to the same period in 2008.
Total interest and dividend income for the second quarter of 2009 increased $81.1 million, or 12.5%, to $727.8 million as compared to $646.7 million for the second quarter of 2008. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to an $8.50 billion, or 18.1%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $55.45 billion for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $46.95 billion for the second quarter of 2008. The increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets was partially offset by a decrease of 26 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield to 5.25% for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 from 5.51% for the same quarter in 2008.
Total interest and dividend income for the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased $191.1 million, or 15.2%, to $1.45 billion as compared to $1.26 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2008. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $9.14 billion, or 20.0%, increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $54.81 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $45.67 billion for the same period in 2008. The increase in interest and dividend income was partially offset by a decrease of 23 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 5.29% for the six months ended June 30, 2009 from 5.52% for the comparable period in 2008.
Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $44.2 million to $413.3 million for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $369.1 million for the same period in 2008. This was primarily due to a $3.99 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, reflecting our continued emphasis on the growth
 
of our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans was partially offset by a 17 basis point decrease in the weighted-average yield to 5.57% from 5.74% for the 2008 second quarter.
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $112.1 million to $827.5 million as compared to $715.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to a $4.64 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $29.52 billion as compared to $24.88 billion for the same period in 2008. The increase in interest income on mortgage loans was partially offset by a decrease of 14 basis points in the weighted-average yield to 5.61%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $35.9 million to $248.5 million for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $212.6 million for the second quarter of 2008. This increase was due primarily to a $3.52 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities to $19.83 billion during the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $16.31 billion for the second quarter of 2008, partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease in the weighted-average yield to 5.01%.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities increased $92.5 million to $499.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $406.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. This increase was due primarily to a $4.13 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities to $19.63 billion during the first six months of 2009 as compared to $15.50 billion for the first six months of 2008, partially offset by a 16 basis point decrease in the weighted-average yield to 5.09%.
The increases in the average balances of mortgage-backed securities were due to purchases of these securities which provide us with a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The decrease in the weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is a result of lower yields on securities purchased during the second half of 2008 and second quarter of 2009 when market interest rates were lower than the yield earned on the existing portfolio.
Dividends on FHLB stock decreased $2.0 million, or 14.3%, to $12.0 million for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $14.0 million for the second quarter of 2008. This decrease was due primarily to a 175 basis point decrease in the average yield earned to 5.48% as compared to 7.23% for the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in the average yield earned was partially offset by a $105.2 million increase in the average balance to $879.3 million for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $774.1 million for the same period in 2008.
Dividends on FHLB stock decreased $9.8 million, or 34.8%, to $18.4 million for the first six months of 2009 as compared to $28.2 million for same period in 2008. This decrease was due primarily to a 334 basis point decrease in the average yield earned to 4.21% as compared to 7.55% for the six months ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in the average yield earned was partially offset by a $127.7 million increase in the average balance to $875.7 million for the first six months of 2009 as compared to $748.0 million for the same period in 2008. We cannot predict the future amount of dividends that the FHLB will pay or the timing of any changes in the dividend yield.
Total interest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 increased $11.9 million, or 2.9%, to $425.4 million as compared to $413.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an $8.33 billion, or 19.8%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $50.46 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 compared with $42.13 billion for the second quarter of 2008. This increase in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 57 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 3.38% for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 compared with 3.95% for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
 
Total interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased $31.4 million, or 3.8%, to $864.9 million as compared to $833.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. This increase was primarily due to an $8.97 billion, or 21.9%, increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $49.87 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $40.90 billion for the corresponding period in 2008. The increase in average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 60 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 3.50% for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to 4.10% for the six months ended June 30, 2008.
Interest expense on deposits decreased $18.1 million, or 12.8%, to $123.3 million for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $141.4 million for the second quarter of 2008. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits of 115 basis points to 2.43% for the 2009 quarter as compared to 3.58% for the 2008 quarter. The decrease was partially offset by a $4.46 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $20.36 billion during the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $15.90 billion for the comparable period in 2008.
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, interest expense on deposits decreased $37.3 million to $262.1 million as compared to $299.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. This decrease is due primarily to a 122 basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to 2.69% for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to 3.91% for the same period in 2008. This decrease was partially offset by a $4.22 billion increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $19.64 billion during the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $15.42 billion for the comparable period in 2008.
The increases in the average balances of interest-bearing deposits reflect our strategy to expand our branch network and to grow deposits in our existing branches by offering competitive rates. Also, in response to the economic recession, households have increased their personal savings. The U.S. household savings rate increased to an average of 6.25% for April and May 2009 as compared to 2.4% for the same period in 2008. We believe that this increase in the household savings rate has contributed to our growth in deposits. The decrease in the average cost of deposits for the first six months of 2009 reflected lower market interest rates. At June 30, 2009, time deposits scheduled to mature within one year totaled $13.98 billion with an average cost of 2.35%. These time deposits are scheduled to mature as follows: $5.40 billion with an average cost of 2.35% in the third quarter of 2009, $4.04 billion with an average cost of 2.15% in the fourth quarter of 2009, $2.05 billion with an average cost of 2.83% in the first quarter of 2010 and $2.49 billion with an average cost of 2.26% in the second quarter of 2010. The current rates for our six month and one year time deposits are 1.75% and 2.00%, respectively. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or as transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing rate.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $30.0 million to $302.1 million for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $272.1 million for the second quarter of 2008. This was primarily due to a $3.87 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $30.10 billion partially offset by a 14 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.03%.
Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $68.7 million to $602.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $534.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. This was primarily due to a $4.75 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.02%.
 
Borrowed funds were used to supplement deposit growth to fund a significant portion of the growth in interest-earning assets during 2008. We have been able to fund substantially all of our 2009 growth with deposits. The decrease in the average cost of borrowings for the first six months of 2009 reflected new borrowings in 2009 and 2008, when market interest rates were lower than existing borrowings and borrowings that matured. Substantially all of our borrowings are callable quarterly at the discretion of the lender after an initial non-call period of one to five years with a final maturity of ten years. We anticipate that none of the borrowings will be called during the next twelve months assuming that market interest rates remain at current levels. During the second quarter of 2009, we modified $300.0 million of borrowings to extend the maturity and call dates of the borrowings by between two and three years. The underlying interest rates remained unchanged.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $32.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $3.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, the provision for loan losses amounted to $52.5 million as compared to $5.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008. The increase in the provision for loan losses was due primarily to an increase in non-performing loans and worsening economic conditions, particularly rising levels of unemployment, during the first six months of 2009. Non-performing loans, defined as non-accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, amounted to $430.9 million at June 30, 2009 compared with $217.6 million at December 31, 2008. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.40% at June 30, 2009 compared with 0.74% at December 31, 2008. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $88.1 million and $49.8 million at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans and non-performing loans was 0.29% and 20.43%, respectively at June 30, 2009, as compared to 0.17% and 22.89%, respectively at December 31, 2008.
We recorded net charge-offs of $9.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 as compared to net charge-offs of $694,000 for the same quarter in 2008. For the sixth months ended June 30, 2009, net charge-offs amounted to $14.2 million as compared to $1.2 million of net charge-offs for the same period in 2008. These charge-offs were primarily due to the results of our reappraisal process for our non-performing residential first mortgage loans and include $590,000 and $1.8 million in charge-offs for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, for loans that have been transferred to foreclosed real estate. We generally obtain new collateral values for loans by 180 days of delinquency. If the estimated fair value of the collateral (less estimated selling costs) is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we charge-off an amount to reduce the loan to the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. As a result, certain losses inherent in our non-performing loans are being recognized as charge-offs which may result in a lower ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans, particularly when accompanied by a concurrent increase in total non-performing loans (i.e. due to the addition of new non-performing loans).
Total non-interest income was $26.6 million for the second quarter 2009 as compared to $2.1 million for the same quarter in 2008. Total non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $28.9 million compared with $4.3 million for the comparable period in 2008. Included in non-interest income for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 were net gains on securities transactions of $24.0 million which resulted from the sale of $761.6 million of mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale. Proceeds from the securities sale were primarily used to fund the purchase of first mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2009.
Total non-interest expense increased $36.6 million, or 75.8%, to $84.9 million for the second quarter of 2009 from $48.3 million for the second quarter of 2008. The increase is primarily due to the FDIC special assessment of $21.1 million and increases of $9.3 million in Federal deposit insurance expense, $5.1 million in compensation and employee benefits expense, $382,000 in net occupancy expense and $772,000 in other non-interest expense. The increase in Federal deposit insurance expense is due
 
primarily to the increases in our deposit insurance assessment rate to 18 basis points of deposits. The special assessment and the increase in our deposit assessment rate were the result of a restoration plan implemented by the FDIC to recapitalize the Deposit Insurance Fund. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense included a $2.3 million increase in compensation costs, due primarily to normal increases in salary as well as additional full time employees, a $1.4 million increase in costs related to our health plan, a $905,000 increase in pension costs and a $585,000 increase in expense related to our stock benefit plans. At June 30, 2009, we had 1,458 full-time equivalent employees as compared to 1,391 at June 30, 2008. The increase in net occupancy expense and other non-interest expense is primarily the result of our branch expansion as well as growth in our lending operations. Included in other non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2009 were write-downs on foreclosed real estate and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate of $399,000 as compared to $430,000 for the second quarter of 2008.
Total non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $139.7 million as compared to $96.4 million during the corresponding 2008 period. The increase is primarily due to the FDIC special assessment of $21.1 million, an $11.5 million increase in Federal deposit insurance expense, a $6.3 million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense, and a $3.0 million increase in other non-interest expense. The increase in Federal deposit insurance expense is due primarily to the increases in our deposit insurance assessment rate to 18 basis points of deposits. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense included a $3.8 million increase in compensation costs, due primarily to normal increases in salary as well as additional full time employees, a $1.8 million increase in pension costs and a $2.6 million increase in costs related to our health plan. These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in expense related to our stock benefit plans. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in ESOP expense as a result of a decline in the value of our common stock during the first six months of 2009. Included in other non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were write-downs on foreclosed real estate and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate, of $1.6 million as compared to $514,000 for the comparable period in 2008.
Our efficiency ratio was 20.94% for the 2009 second quarter as compared to 20.52% for the 2008 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, our efficiency ratio was 20.08% compared with 22.40% for the corresponding 2008 period. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest expense, excluding the FDIC special assessment of $21.1 million, by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, excluding net securities gains of $24.0 million. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense (excluding the FDIC special assessment of $21.1 million) to average total assets for the second quarter of 2009 was 0.45% as compared to 0.41% for the second quarter of 2008. Our ratio of non-interest expense (excluding the FDIC special assessment of $21.1 million) to average total assets for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was 0.42% compared with 0.42% for the corresponding period in 2008.
Income tax expense amounted to $83.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with $73.2 million for the corresponding period in 2008. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2009 was 39.53% compared with 39.82% for the second quarter of 2008. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $167.3 million compared with $129.5 million for the corresponding 2008 period. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was 39.56% compared with 39.38% for the six months ended June 30, 2008.
