Exhibit 99.1
RELEASE 8:00 AM  October 24, 2012
 
Paramus, New Jersey, October 24, 2012 - Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HCBK) (the "Company"), the holding company for Hudson City Savings Bank (the "Bank"), reported today net income of $55.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 as compared to net income of $84.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. Diluted earnings per share amounted to $0.11 for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.17 for the third quarter of 2011. Included in the 2012 third quarter earnings was $6.1 million of expenses related to the previously announced merger with M&T Bank Corporation ("M&T"). Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2012, which excludes merger-related expenses, amounted to $59.6 million or $0.12 per diluted share (non-GAAP measures). Please see the attached Reconciliation of GAAP and Operating Earnings for a reconciliation of operating earnings to the Company's earnings reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the Company reported net income of $201.2 million as compared to a net loss of $375.5 million for the same period in 2011. Diluted earnings per share was $0.41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to a net loss per share of $0.76 for the same period in 2011. The net loss for the first nine months of 2011 was driven by the results of a restructuring of the Company's balance sheet in the first quarter of 2011 (the "Restructuring Transaction"). Operating earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 amounted to $204.9 million or $0.42 per diluted share as compared to operating earnings of $273.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share for the same period in 2011 (non-GAAP measures). Please see the attached Reconciliation of GAAP and Operating Earnings for a reconciliation of operating earnings to the Company's earnings reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company also reported today that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share payable on November 30, 2012 to shareholders of record on November 9, 2012.
Financial highlights for the third quarter of 2012 are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented, "This quarter's net income is reflective of the conditions affecting residential portfolio lenders. Our net interest margin decreased 10 basis points to 2.02% in the third quarter of 2012 from the linked quarter as yields on our mortgage related assets declined due to record low market interest rates. The decision by the Federal Reserve to continue to purchase mortgage-backed securities will likely keep rates low for the foreseeable future."
Mr. Hermance continued, "Since our initial public offering in 1999, we pursued initiatives that we believed would build shareholder value. The merger with M&T is a continuation of that philosophy and reflects a thorough evaluation of our strategic alternatives, including the strategic plan adopted in the first half of 2012. We are pleased to partner with M&T whose balance sheet structure, geographic markets and business strategies complement those of Hudson City and we believe that our shareholders, customers and communities will benefit from this merger. We have begun the process of obtaining regulatory and shareholder approvals for the merger which we expect to complete in the second quarter of 2013."
Statement of Financial Condition Summary
Total assets decreased $3.46 billion, or 7.6%, to $41.90 billion at September 30, 2012 from $45.36 billion at December 31, 2011. The decrease in total assets reflected a $1.61 billion decrease in net loans, a $1.26 billion decrease in total mortgage-backed securities, a $328.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a $120.4 million decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock.
 
Net loans amounted to $27.53 billion at September 30, 2012 as compared to $29.14 billion at December 31, 2011. During the first nine months of 2012, our loan production amounted to $3.92 billion as compared to $4.09 billion for the same period in 2011. Loan production was offset by principal repayments of $5.38 billion in the first nine months of 2012, as compared to principal repayments of $4.85 billion for the first nine months of 2011. Loan production declined during the first nine months of 2012 due to a decline in loan originations which reflects our low appetite for adding long-term fixed rate loans in the current low market interest rate environment. The decrease in net loans was also due to continued elevated levels of refinancing activity caused by low market interest rates.
Total mortgage-backed securities decreased $1.26 billion to $12.03 billion at September 30, 2012 from $13.29 billion at December 31, 2011. The decrease in mortgage-backed securities reflected repayments of $2.73 billion, partially offset by purchases of $1.47 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored entities ("GSEs").
Total liabilities decreased $3.61 billion, or 8.9%, to $37.19 billion at September 30, 2012 from $40.80 billion at December 31, 2011. The decrease in total liabilities primarily reflected a $2.15 billion decrease in borrowed funds and a decrease in total deposits of $1.49 billion. Borrowings amounted to $12.93 billion at September 30, 2012 as compared to $15.08 billion at December 31, 2011. The decrease in borrowed funds is a result of the maturity of short-term borrowings during the first nine months of 2012. The decrease in deposits is primarily due to planned reductions in our deposit rates to curtail deposit growth at this time of limited investment opportunities.
Total shareholders' equity increased $151.6 million to $4.71 billion at September 30, 2012 from $4.56 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to net income of $201.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $54.7 million. The increase was partially offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders of $119.1 million. At September 30, 2012, our consolidated shareholders' equity to asset ratio was 11.25% and our tangible book value per share was $9.17.
Accumulated other comprehensive income amounted to $94.4 million at September 30, 2012 and included a $141.6 million after-tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale ($239.3 million pre-tax) partially offset by a $47.2 million after-tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the funded status of our employee benefit plans. Accumulated other comprehensive income amounted to $39.7 million at December 31, 2011 and included an $89.3 million after-tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale ($150.9 million pre-tax) partially offset by a $49.6 million after-tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the funded status of our employee benefit plans.
Statement of Income Summary
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "FOMC") noted that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. Growth in employment has slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. The FOMC noted that while the housing sector has showed signs of improvement and household spending continues to advance, growth in business fixed investment has slowed. The national unemployment rate was 7.8% during September 2012 representing a decline from 8.5% in December 2011. The FOMC decided to maintain the overnight lending rate at zero to 0.25% during the third quarter of 2012 and stated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015. As a result, market interest rates have remained at low levels, and consequently, the yields on our mortgage-related assets have continued to decrease during the first nine months of 2012.
 
The FOMC also decided to expand its accommodative monetary policy by purchasing an additional $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities per month to ensure that inflation is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate regarding both inflation and unemployment. The Federal Reserve program "Operation Twist", which was set to expire at the end of June, has been extended until the end of the year. This program consists of the purchase of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 to 30 years funded by the sale of an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less. These programs will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.
Net interest income decreased $41.3 million, or 16.9%, to $203.3 million for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $244.6 million for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in net interest income reflects the overall decrease in the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest rate spread increased slightly to 1.80% for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to 1.76% for the third quarter of 2011. Our net interest margin was 2.02% for the third quarter of 2012 as compared 1.97% for the third quarter of 2011.
Net interest income decreased $112.3 million, or 14.5%, to $661.7 million for the first nine months of 2012 as compared to $774.0 million for the first nine months of 2011. Our interest rate spread increased 18 basis points to 1.91% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to 1.73% for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Our net interest margin increased 17 basis points to 2.11% as compared to 1.94% for the those same respective periods. The increase in our interest rate spread and net interest margin for the first nine months of 2012 is primarily due to the effects of the extinguishment of $4.3 billion of borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as the Restructuring Transaction.
The Restructuring Transaction resulted in the extinguishment of $12.5 billion of structured putable borrowings with an average cost of 3.56%. The extinguishment of borrowings was funded by the sale of $8.66 billion of securities and new short-term borrowings of $5.0 billion. The Restructuring Transaction reduced after-tax earnings by $649.3 million. In addition to the Restructuring Transaction, we extinguished $4.3 billion of structured borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2011 using cash proceeds from the calls of investment securities and repayments on mortgage-related assets (the Restructuring Transaction and the extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 are collectively referred to as the "Transactions").
Total interest and dividend income for the third quarter of 2012 decreased $119.1 million, or 22.7%, to $405.4 million from $524.5 million for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of total interest-earning assets of $9.00 billion, or 18.0%, to $41.02 billion for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $50.02 billion for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in total interest and dividend income was also due to a decrease of 24 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 3.95% for the third quarter of 2012 from 4.19% for the third quarter in 2011. The decrease in the average balance of total interest-earning assets was due primarily to the effects of the debt extinguishments in the fourth quarter of 2011 and repayments of mortgage-related assets during the first nine months of 2012 due to the low interest rate environment.
Total interest and dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 decreased $409.9 million, or 24.2%, to $1.28 billion from $1.69 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $10.84 billion or 20.5% decrease in the average balance of total interest-earning assets to $42.16 billion for the first nine months of 2012 from $53.00 billion for the same period in 2011. The decrease in total interest and dividend income was also
 
due to a decrease of 20 basis points in the annualized weighted-average yield on total interest-earning assets to 4.06% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 from 4.26% for the same period in 2011. The decrease in the average balance of total interest-earning assets was due primarily to the effects of the Transactions and elevated levels of repayments of mortgage-related assets during the first nine months of 2012 due to the low interest rate environment.
Interest on first mortgage loans decreased $54.7 million, or 14.6%, to $321.0 million for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $375.7 million for the third quarter of 2011. This was primarily due to a 38 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average yield to 4.67% for the third quarter of 2012 from 5.05% for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in interest income on mortgage loans was also due to a $2.24 billion decrease in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $27.52 billion for the third quarter of 2012 from $29.76 billion for the same quarter in 2011.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, interest on first mortgage loans decreased $139.3 million, or 12.2%, to $999.7 million from $1.14 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. This was primarily due to a 32 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average yield to 4.76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 from 5.08% for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in interest income on mortgage loans was also due to a $1.88 billion decrease in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $28.00 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 from $29.88 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2011.
The decreases in the average yields earned during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2012 were due to lower market interest rates on mortgage products and also due to the continued mortgage refinancing activity. Refinancing activity, which resulted in continued elevated levels of loan repayments, also caused the average balance of our first mortgage loans to decline for those same periods.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities decreased $35.0 million to $73.2 million for the third quarter of 2012 from $108.2 million for the third quarter of 2011. This decrease was due primarily to a $2.67 billion decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities to $12.03 billion for the third quarter of 2012 from $14.70 billion for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities was due primarily to elevated levels of principal repayments in the current low interest rate environment. The decrease in interest on mortgage-backed securities was also due to a 50 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average yield to 2.44% for the third quarter of 2012 from 2.94% for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in the weighted-average yield is a result of principal repayments on securities that have higher yields than the existing portfolio as well as the re-pricing of variable rate mortgage-backed securities in this continued low interest rate environment.
Interest on mortgage-backed securities decreased $170.1 million to $246.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 from $416.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. This decrease was due primarily to a $4.84 billion decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities to $12.35 billion for the first nine months of 2012 from $17.19 billion for the same period in 2011. The decrease in interest income on mortgage-backed securities was also due to a 57 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average yield to 2.66% for the first nine months of 2012 from 3.23% for the first nine months of 2011. The decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities was due primarily to the effects of the Restructuring Transaction. The decrease in the weighted-average yield is a result of principal repayments on securities that have higher yields than the existing portfolio as well as the re-pricing of variable rate mortgage-backed securities in this continued low interest rate environment.
Interest on investment securities decreased $24.6 million to $2.9 million for the third quarter of 2012 from $27.5 million for the third quarter of 2011. This decrease was due primarily to a $2.85 billion decrease in
 
the average balance of investment securities to $453.1 million for the third quarter of 2012 from $3.30 billion for the third quarter of 2011. In addition, the average yield of investment securities decreased 73 basis points to 2.60% for the third quarter of 2012 from 3.33% for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in the average balance is due primarily to calls of $3.1 billion of investment securities during the second half of 2011.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, interest on investment securities decreased $85.2 million to $8.7 million from $93.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. This decrease was due primarily to a $3.32 billion decrease in the average balance of investment securities to $423.3 million for the first nine months of 2012 from $3.74 billion for the first nine months of 2011. The decrease in the average balance is due primarily to calls of $3.4 billion of investment securities during 2011. In addition, the average yield of investment securities decreased 61 basis points to 2.74% for the first nine months of 2012 from 3.35% for the same period in 2011. The decrease in the average yield earned reflects current market interest rates.
Dividends on FHLB stock decreased $3.9 million, or 44.3%, to $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2012 from $8.8 million for the third quarter of 2011. This decrease was due primarily to a $342.5 million decrease in the average balance of FHLB stock to $406.3 million for the third quarter of 2012 from $748.8 million for the third quarter of 2011. The effect of the decrease was partially offset by a 6 basis point increase in the average dividend yield earned to 4.78% for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to 4.72% for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in the average balance of FHLB stock was primarily due to mandatory redemptions of stock due to a decrease in the amount of borrowings outstanding with the FHLB.
Dividends on FHLB stock decreased $12.4 million, or 39.6%, to $18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 from $31.3 million for the comparable period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a $356.4 million decrease in the average balance of FHLB stock to $445.1 million for the first nine months of 2012 from $801.5 million for the same period in 2011. The effect of the decrease was partially offset by a 46 basis point increase in the average dividend yield earned to 5.66% as compared to 5.20% for the first nine months of 2011.
Interest on Federal funds and other overnight deposits sold amounted to $194,000 for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $519,000 for the third quarter of 2011. The average balance of Federal funds sold amounted to $348.2 million for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $1.20 billion for the third quarter of 2011. The yield earned on Federal funds sold was 0.22% for the 2012 third quarter and 0.17% for the 2011 third quarter.
Interest on Federal funds sold and other overnight deposits amounted to $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to $1.9 million for the first nine months of 2011. The average balance of Federal funds sold amounted to $662.3 million for the first nine months of 2012 as compared to $1.07 billion for the same period in 2011. The yield earned on Federal funds sold was 0.24% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in the average balance of Federal funds sold is primarily a result of the timing of the Transactions.
Total interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 decreased $77.8 million, or 27.8%, to $202.1 million from $279.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. This decrease was primarily due to an $8.70 billion, or 19.1%, decrease in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $36.95 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 compared to $45.65 billion for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease was also due to a 28 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 2.15% for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 compared to 2.43% for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in the average balance of
 
total interest-bearing liabilities was due primarily to the effects of the debt extinguishments in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as $8.75 billion of borrowings that matured during the second half of 2011 and the first nine months of 2012.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012 total interest expense decreased $297.6 million, or 32.3%, to $623.2 million from $920.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. This decrease was primarily due to a $10.38 billion, or 21.4%, decrease in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities to $38.20 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 from $48.58 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was also due to a 38 basis point decrease in the annualized weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities to 2.15% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 from 2.53% for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities was due primarily to the reduction of total borrowings as part of the Transactions.
Interest expense on deposits decreased $24.6 million, or 30.2%, to $56.9 million for the third quarter of 2012 from $81.5 million for the third quarter of 2011. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits of 34 basis points to 0.96% for the third quarter of 2012 from 1.30% for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease is also due to a $1.26 billion decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $23.67 billion for the third quarter of 2012 from $24.93 billion for the third quarter of 2011.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, interest expense on deposits decreased $63.8 million, or 25.5%, to $186.4 million from $250.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits of 31 basis points to 1.03% for the first nine months of 2012 from 1.34% for the first nine months of 2011. The decrease is also due to a $681.3 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $24.25 billion for the first nine months of 2012 from $24.93 billion for the first nine months of 2011.
The decrease in the average cost of deposits for the first nine months of 2012 reflected lower market interest rates and our decision to maintain lower deposit rates to slow deposit growth. At September 30, 2012, time deposits scheduled to mature within one year totaled $7.94 billion with an average cost of 0.99%. These time deposits are scheduled to mature as follows: $3.13 billion with an average cost of 0.99% in the fourth quarter of 2012, $2.29 billion with an average cost of 0.94% in the first quarter of 2013, $1.37 billion with an average cost of 1.11% in the second quarter of 2013 and $1.15 billion with an average cost of 0.96% in the third quarter of 2013. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or as transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing rate.
Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $53.2 million to $145.2 million for the third quarter of 2012 from $198.4 million for the third quarter of 2011. This decrease was due to a $7.44 billion decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds to $13.28 billion for the third quarter of 2012 from $20.72 billion for the third quarter of 2011. This decrease was partially offset by a 48 basis point increase in the annualized weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.28% for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to 3.80% for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds was primarily due to the effects of the debt extinguishments in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds was due to the maturity of short-term borrowings that were used to fund a portion of the debt extinguishments in the Restructuring Transaction.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012 interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $233.8 million to $436.8 million from $670.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. This decrease was due to a $9.70 billion decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds to $13.95 billion
 
for the first nine months of 2012 from $23.65 billion for the first nine months of 2011. This decrease was partially offset by a 32 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds to 4.11% for the first nine months of 2012 as compared to 3.79% for the first nine months of 2011. The decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds is primarily due to the effects of the Transactions. The increase in the weighted-average cost of borrowed funds was due to the maturity of short-term borrowings that were used to fund a portion of the debt extinguishments in the Restructuring Transaction.
Borrowings amounted to $12.93 billion at September 30, 2012 with an average cost of 4.37%. Borrowings scheduled to mature over the next 12 months are as follows: $750.0 million with an average cost of 0.80% in the fourth quarter of 2012. There are no scheduled maturities for the first, second or third quarters of 2013.
The provision for loan losses amounted to $20.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 as compared to $25.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in our provision for loan losses during the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 was due primarily to the overall declining trend in net charge-offs and a decrease in the size of the loan portfolio, yet resulted in an overall increase in our allowance for loan losses as non-performing loans continued to increase. Non-performing loans, defined as non-accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, amounted to $1.14 billion at September 30, 2012 compared with $1.02 billion at December 31, 2011. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 4.12% at September 30, 2012 compared with 3.48% at December 31, 2011. The highly publicized foreclosure issues that have affected the nation's largest mortgage loan servicers have resulted in greater bank regulatory, court and state attorney general scrutiny. As a result, our foreclosure process and the time to complete a foreclosure continue to be prolonged, especially in New York and New Jersey where 79% of our non-performing loans are located. We are now experiencing a time frame to repayment or foreclosure ranging from 30 to 36 months from the initial non-performing period. This protracted foreclosure process delays our ability to resolve non-performing loans through the sale of the underlying collateral and our ability to maximize any recoveries.
Loans delinquent 30 to 59 days amounted to $413.2 million at September 30, 2012 as compared to $427.2 million at December 31, 2011. Loans delinquent 60 to 89 days amounted to $212.1 million at September 30, 2012 as compared to $187.4 million at December 31, 2011. The allowance for loans losses amounted to $291.6 million at September 30, 2012 as compared to $273.8 million at December 31, 2011. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans and as a percent of non-performing loans was 1.05% and 25.51%, respectively at September 30, 2012, as compared to 0.93% and 26.77%, respectively at December 31, 2011.
Net charge-offs amounted to $16.3 million for third quarter of 2012 as compared to $18.6 million for the third quarter of 2011. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.24% for third quarter of 2012 as compared to 0.25% for the third quarter of 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net charge-offs amounted to $52.2 million as compared to $62.8 million of net charge-offs for the same period in 2011.
Total non-interest income was $3.0 million for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $3.1 million for the same quarter in 2011. Non-interest income is primarily made up of service fees and charges on deposit and loan accounts.
Total non-interest income was $8.7 million for the first nine months of 2012 as compared to $111.0 million for the same period in 2011. Included in non-interest income for the first nine months of 2011 were net gains on securities transactions of $102.5 million which resulted from the sale of $9.04 billion of securities available-for-sale. Substantially all of the proceeds from the sale of securities were used to pay off borrowings in the Restructuring Transaction. There were no security sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2012.
 
Total non-interest expense amounted to $93.9 million for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $83.7 million for the same period in 2011. This increase is due to increases of $6.7 million in compensation and employee benefit costs and $7.0 million in other expense (primarily merger related), partially offset by a decrease of $3.6 million in Federal deposit insurance expense. The decrease in Federal deposit insurance expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 is primarily due to the reduction in the size of our balance sheet as a result of the Transactions.
Compensation and employee benefit costs increased $6.7 million, or 24.6%, to $33.9 million for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $27.2 million for the same period in 2011. The increase in compensation costs is primarily due to increases of $2.3 million in expense related to our stock benefit plans, $2.0 million in compensation costs, $1.6 million in health plan expense and $688,000 in pension expense. The increase in stock benefit plans expense is primarily due to the price of our common stock which increased during the quarter primarily as a result of the announcement of the Merger. The increase in compensation and health plan costs was due primarily to additional full time equivalent employees as well as normal salary increases. The increase in pension expense is due primarily to the discount rate and other actuarial assumptions used in determining pension expense. At September 30, 2012, we had 1,608 full-time equivalent employees as compared to 1,586 at December 31, 2011 and 1,580 at September 30, 2011.
Included in other non-interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 were $6.1 million of expenses related to the Merger. Also included in other expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 were write-downs on foreclosed real estate and net losses and (gains) on the sale of foreclosed real estate of ($13,000) as compared to $2.1 million for the third quarter of 2011. We sold 46 properties during the third quarter of 2012 and had 134 properties in foreclosed real estate, 39 of which were under contract to sell as of September 30, 2012. For the third quarter of 2011, we sold 39 properties and had 130 properties in foreclosed real estate, of which 39 were under contract to sell as of September 30, 2011.
Total non-interest expense amounted to $269.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to $1.41 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Included in total non-interest expense for the first nine months of 2011 was a $1.17 billion loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the Restructuring Transaction. Included in total non-interest expense for the first nine months of 2012 was an increase of $8.4 million in compensation and employee benefit costs, an increase of $11.4 million in other expense, and an increase of $10.6 million in Federal deposit insurance expense.
Compensation and employee benefit costs increased $8.4 million, or 9.6%, to $96.4 million for the first nine months of 2012 as compared to $88.0 million for the same period in 2011. The increase in compensation costs is primarily due to increases of $3.6 million in compensation costs, $2.1 million in health plan expense, $2.0 million in pension expense and $615,000 in expense related to our stock benefit plans. The increase in compensation and health plan costs was due primarily to additional full time equivalent employees as well as normal salary increases. The increase in pension expense is due primarily to the discount rate and other actuarial assumptions used in determining pension expense.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, Federal deposit insurance expense increased $10.5 million, or 12.6%, to $93.9 million from $83.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. This increase was due primarily to the new insurance assessment methodology adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that became effective on April 1, 2011 and which redefined the assessment base as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Previously, deposit insurance assessments were based on the amount of deposits.
 
Included in other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were write-downs on foreclosed real estate and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate of $1.3 million as compared to $4.9 million for the comparable period in 2011. We sold 150 properties during the first nine months of 2012 as compared to 113 properties for the same period in 2011.
Our efficiency ratio was 45.50% for the 2012 third quarter as compared to 33.77% for the 2011 third quarter. Our operating efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was 42.56% for the 2012 third quarter as compared to 33.77% for the 2011 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, our efficiency ratio was 40.13% compared to 159.3% for the corresponding 2011 period, while our operating efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was 39.23% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to 30.25% for the corresponding 2011 period. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the third quarter of 2012 was 0.88% as compared to 0.65% for the third quarter of 2011. Our annualized ratio of non-interest expense to average total assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was 0.85% compared with 3.47% for the corresponding period in 2011. Excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt and Merger related expenses, our annualized ratio of operating non-interest expense to average total assets was 0.80% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to 0.59% for the same period in 2011. Please see the attached Reconciliation of GAAP and Operating Earnings for a reconciliation of operating earnings to the Company's earnings reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and a calculation of the operating efficiency ratio.

This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures of operating earnings. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are required to be disclosed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
