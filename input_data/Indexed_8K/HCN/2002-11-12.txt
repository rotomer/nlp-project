ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The following selected financial data for the five years ended December 31, 2001, are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company. - -------------------------- (1) General and administrative and other expenses include loan expense, provision for loan losses, and other operating expenses. -4-
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2001, the Company's net real estate investments totaled approximately $1,213,564,000, that included 150 assisted living facilities, 57 skilled nursing facilities and seven specialty care facilities. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, the Company anticipates making additional investments in health care related facilities. New investments are funded from temporary borrowings under the Company's line of credit arrangements, internally generated cash and the proceeds derived from asset sales. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under the line of credit arrangements, is expected to be provided through a combination of private and public offerings of debt and equity securities, and the assumption of secured debt. The Company believes its liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations, meet debt service and dividend requirements, and finance future investments. During the previous two years, the underperformance of publicly owned skilled nursing and assisted living companies, combined with the much publicized shift in equity funds flow from income-oriented investments to high-growth opportunities, impaired the stock valuations in the health care REIT sector. In 2001, certain events took place that improved the access to capital for the health care REIT sector. First, several of the publicly owned skilled nursing companies that had previously filed for bankruptcy protection, settled their claims and emerged from bankruptcy. Assisted living construction declined significantly, allowing more of the existing projects to improve their occupancy and stabilize operations. Finally, the broad stock market decline and the drop in interest rates generated renewed interest in income-oriented investments such as REITs. As a result of these factors, the Company was able to access the capital markets during 2001. In June 2001, the Company issued 3,450,000 shares of common stock, generating net proceeds of $74,184,000. In August 2001, the Company issued $175 million of senior notes, due in 2007 at an effective yield of 7.78%. During 2001, the Company invested $181,420,000 in real property, provided permanent mortgage and loan financings of $18,639,000, made construction advances of $17,075,000 and funded $4,084,000 of subdebt investments. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had approximately $35,000,000 in unfunded commitments. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had stockholders' equity of $757,870,000 and a total outstanding debt balance of $491,216,000, which represents a debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.39 to 1.0. In January 2001, the Company extended its primary revolving line of credit through March 31, 2003. Under the terms of the extension, the total commitment was reduced from $175 million to $150 million and the effective interest rate was adjusted to the lender's prime rate or LIBOR plus 1.50%. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Company's revolving lines of credit. The Company also had a $25 million unsecured line of credit with no borrowings at December 31, 2001, and a $60 million secured line of credit, with $33 million outstanding at December 31, 2001. In February 2002, the Company issued 906,125 shares of common stock, generating net proceeds of $23,619,000. As of February 28, 2002, the Company had an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which the Company may issue up to $652,000,000 of securities including debt securities, common and preferred stock and warrants. Depending upon market conditions, the Company anticipates issuing securities under its shelf registration to invest in additional health care facilities and to repay borrowings under the Company's line of credit arrangements. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001: The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001: Credit enhancements include letters of credit provided by the Company and agreements to purchase facilities in the event that the present owners default upon their obligations. -5-
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DECEMBER 31, 2001 VS. DECEMBER 31, 2000 Revenues were comprised of the following: The Company generated increased rental income as a result of the completion of real property construction projects for which the Company began receiving rent and the purchase of properties previously financed by the Company. This was offset by a reduction in interest income due to the repayment of mortgage loans and the purchase of properties previously financed by the Company. The reduction in commitment fees and other income is due primarily to the significant reduction in construction and investing activity. During 2001, the Company received payoffs on mortgages that had significant prepayment fee requirements, generating the large increase over the prior year. Expenses were comprised of the following: The decrease in interest expense from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to lower average borrowings during the year, offset by a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting interest expense. The Company capitalizes certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by the Company. The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates the Company's cost of financing. The Company's interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. Capitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2001, totaled $841,000, as compared with $3,079,000 for the same period in 2000. The provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of additional investment in properties owned directly by the Company. In 2000, the Company restructured its investments with Summerville Health Care. As part of the restructuring agreement, Summerville agreed to permit the Company to re-lease 10 of its 11 facilities to new operators and repaid substantially all of the Company's subdebt investment. As part of Summerville's recapitalization, the Company's $2,000,000 non-yielding preferred stock investment was substantially diluted. Accordingly, the Company wrote off its investment in 2000, resulting in a $2,000,000 charge. -6-
As a result of the various factors mentioned above, net income available to common stockholders was $47,044,000, or $1.52 per diluted share, for 2001 as compared with $54,566,000, or $1.91 per diluted share, for 2000. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DECEMBER 31, 2000 VS. DECEMBER 31, 1999 Revenues were comprised of the following: The Company generated increased rental income as a result of the completion of real property construction projects for which the Company began receiving rent and the purchase of properties previously financed by the Company. This was partially offset by a reduction in interest income due to the repayment of mortgage loans and the purchase of properties previously financed by the Company. Expenses were comprised of the following: The increase in interest expense from 1999 to 2000 was due to higher average interest rates on the Company's line of credit and secured debt and a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting interest expense. The Company capitalizes certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by the Company. The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest which approximates the Company's cost of financing. The Company's interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. Capitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2000, totaled $3,079,000, as compared with $8,578,000 for the same period in 1999. The provision for depreciation increased as a result of additional investment in properties owned directly by the Company. In 2000, the Company restructured its investments with Summerville Health Care. As part of the restructuring agreement, Summerville agreed to permit the Company to re-lease 10 of its 11 facilities to new operators and repaid substantially all of the Company's subdebt investment. As part of Summerville's recapitalization, the Company's $2,000,000 non-yielding preferred stock investment was substantially diluted. Accordingly, the Company wrote off its investment in 2000, resulting in a $2,000,000 charge. -7-
As a result of the various factors mentioned above, net income available to common stockholders was $54,566,000, or $1.91 per diluted share, for 2000 as compared with $62,824,000, or $2.21 per diluted share, for 1999. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment. These indicators may include anticipated operating losses at the property level, the tenant's inability to make rent payments, and changes in the market that may permanently reduce the value of the property. If indicators of impairment exist, then the undiscounted future cash flows from the most likely use of the property are compared to the current net book value. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value, an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the net book value exceeds the current fair market value. This analysis requires the Company to determine if indicators of impairment exist and to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows to be generated from the property during the period the property is expected to be held. If the projections or assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge and reduce the net book value of the property owned. ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The Company regularly evaluates the collectibility of its loans receivables based on a combination of factors. These factors include current economic conditions, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, and value of the underlying property. If such factors indicate that there is greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances may be required. POTENTIAL RISKS FROM BANKRUPTCIES The Company is exposed to the risk that its operators may not be able to meet the rent or principal and interest payments due the Company, which may result in an operator bankruptcy or insolvency. Although the Company's operating lease agreements provide the Company the right to evict an operator, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and the Company's mortgage loans provide the Company the right to terminate an investment, demand immediate payment of principal and unpaid interest and foreclose on the collateral, the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict or delay the Company's ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal or interest in the case of a mortgage loan. The receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. In addition, the Company may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to retain control of a facility or to transition it to a new operator. In some instances, the Company has terminated its lease with an operator and relet the facility to another operator. In some of those situations, the Company provided working capital loans and limited indemnification of the new operator. If the Company cannot transition the facility to a new operator, it may take possession of a facility, which may expose the Company to successor liabilities. Should such events occur, the Company's revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. IMPACT OF INFLATION During the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected the earnings of the Company because of the moderate inflation rate. Additionally, earnings of the Company are primarily long-term investments with fixed interest rates. These investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior notes and borrowings under the revolving lines of credit. During inflationary periods, that generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, the Company's ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and -8-
long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, the Company believes that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing.

Health Care REIT, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED MATTERS INDUSTRY The Company is a self-administered real estate investment trust that invests primarily in long-term care facilities, which include skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. The Company also invests in specialty care facilities. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after the elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. LOANS RECEIVABLE Loans receivable consist of long-term mortgage loans, construction-period loans maturing in two years or less, working capital loans and subdebt investments. Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding. The mortgage and construction loans are primarily collateralized by a first mortgage on or assignment of partnership interest in the related facilities, which consist of skilled nursing, assisted living and specialty care facilities. The working capital loans are generally secured by second mortgages or interests in receivables. Subdebt investments represent debt instruments to operators of facilities that have been financed by the Company. These obligations are generally secured by the operator's leasehold rights and corporate guaranties. REAL PROPERTY OWNED Substantially all of the properties owned by the Company are leased under operating leases and are recorded at cost. These properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from fifteen to forty years for buildings and five to twelve years for fixtures. The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that the depreciable life may need to be changed. The Company considers external factors relating to each asset. If these external factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of the asset over the remaining amortization period indicate that the asset will not be recoverable, the carrying value will be adjusted to the estimated fair value. The leases generally extend for a minimum 10-year period and provide for payment of all taxes, insurance and maintenance by the lessees. In general, operating lease income includes base rent payments plus fixed annual rent increases, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period. This income is greater than the amount of cash received during the first half of the lease term. CAPITALIZATION OF CONSTRUCTION PERIOD INTEREST The Company capitalizes interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by the Company. The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest which approximates the Company's cost of financing. The Company capitalized interest costs of $841,000, $3,079,000, and $8,578,000, during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, related to construction of real property owned by the Company. The Company's interest expense reflected in the statement of income has been reduced by the amounts capitalized. ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in the Company's loans receivable. The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of these loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectibility of loan payments. -15-
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED MATTERS (CONTINUED) DEFERRED LOAN EXPENSES Deferred loan expenses are costs incurred by the Company in connection with the issuance of short-term and long-term debt. The Company amortizes these costs over the term of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the interest yield method. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. EQUITY INVESTMENTS Management determines the appropriate classification of an equity investment at the time of acquisition and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. Included in equity investments are the common stock of a corporation, valued at historical cost, and ownership representing a 31% interest in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P., a property investment group that specializes in the financing, through sale and leaseback transactions, of nursing and care homes located in the United Kingdom. The ownership interest is accounted for under the equity method. Marketable securities available for sale are stated at market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Marketable securities reflect the market value of the common stock of two publicly owned corporations, which were obtained by the Company at no cost. COMMITMENT FEES Commitment fees are earned by the Company for its agreement to provide direct and standby financing to, and credit enhancement for, owners and operators of health care facilities. The Company amortizes commitment fees over the initial fixed term of the lease, the mortgage or the construction period related to such investments. FEDERAL INCOME TAX No provision has been made for federal income taxes since the Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and the Company believes that it has met the requirements for qualification as such for each taxable year. See Note 10. NET INCOME PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares for the period adjusted for non-vested shares of restricted stock. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income includes unrealized gains or losses on the Company's marketable securities ($78,000 and $130,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively) and foreign currency translation adjustments (($1,001,000) and ($874,000) at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively). These items are included as components of stockholders' equity. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, that the Company is required to adopt beginning January 1, 2002 with transition provisions for certain matters. The new rules on asset impairment supersede Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of (FAS 121), and provide a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of. The Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. -16-

The agreement specifies that borrowings under the revolving credit are subject to interest payable in periods no longer than three months on either the agent bank's base rate of interest or 1.5% over LIBOR interest rate (based at the Company's option). In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee ranging from an annual rate of 0.20% to 0.375% and an annual agent's fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the agreement. The Company has another unsecured line of credit with a bank for a total of $25,000,000, which expires April 30, 2002. Borrowings under this line of credit are subject to interest at the bank's prime rate of interest (4.75% at December 31, 2001) and are due on demand. At December 31, 2001, there were no borrowings under either of the unsecured lines of credit. -19-

Vesting periods range from six months for directors to five years for officers and key salaried employees. Expense, which is recognized as the shares vest based on the market value at the date of the award, totaled $1,164,000, $1,090,000, and $1,080,000, in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2001 (shares in thousands): The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees in accounting for its employee stock options as permitted under FASB Statement No. 123 ("FASB 123"), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense for the stock option grants when the market price on the underlying stock on the date of grant equals the exercise price of the Company's employee stock option. Pro forma information has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and restricted shares under the fair value method. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following range of assumptions: risk-free interest rates from 3.44% to 7.60%, dividend yields of 8% to 12%, expected lives of seven years, and expected volatility of .18% to .244%. Had compensation cost for the stock-based compensation plans been determined in accordance with FASB 123, net income would have been reduced by $465,000, $267,000, and $621,000, in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and net income per common share would have been lower by $.01, $.01 and $.02, in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company has a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Money Purchase Pension Plan ("the Plans") covering all eligible employees. Under the Plans, eligible employees may make contributions, and the Company may make matching contributions and a profit sharing contribution. Company contributions to these Plans totaled $175,000, $171,000, and $144,000, in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company has a non-qualified senior executive retirement plan designed to provide pension benefits for certain officers. Pension benefits are based on compensation and length of service and the plan is unfunded. The accrued liability for the plan was $41,000 at December 31, 2001. -21-
9. PREFERRED STOCK In January 1999, the Company sold 3,000,000 shares of Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation value of $25.00 per share and will pay dividends equivalent to the greater of (i) the annual dividend rate of $2.25 per share (a quarterly dividend rate of $0.5625 per share); or (ii) the quarterly dividend then payable per common share on an as converted basis. The preferred shares are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $25.625 per share. The Company has the right to redeem the preferred shares after five years. The Company has 3,000,000 shares of 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Non-Voting Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. On and after May 1, 2003, the Preferred Stock may be redeemed for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date. 10. INCOME TAXES AND DISTRIBUTIONS To qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, 90% of taxable income (including capital gains) must be distributed to stockholders. Real estate investment trusts that do not distribute a certain amount of current year taxable income in the current year are also subject to a 4% federal excise tax. The principal reasons for the difference between undistributed net income for federal income tax purposes and financial statement purposes are the recognition of straight-line rent for reporting purposes, different useful lives and depreciation methods for real property and the provision for losses for reporting purposes versus bad debt expense for tax purposes. Cash distributions paid to stockholders, for federal income tax purposes, are as follows: 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has agreements to purchase two health care facilities, or the loans with respect thereto, in the event that the present owners default upon their obligations. In consideration for these agreements, the Company receives and recognizes fees annually related to these agreements. Although the terms of these agreements vary, the purchase prices are equal to the amount of the outstanding obligations financing the facility. These agreements expire through the year 2005. In addition, the Company has an outstanding letter of credit relating to one assisted living project. At December 31, 2001, obligations under these agreements for which the Company was contingently liable aggregated approximately $11,425,000. 12. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN Under the terms of a Stockholder Rights Plan approved by the Board of Directors in July 1994, a Preferred Share Right ("Right") is attached to and automatically trades with each outstanding share of Common Stock. The Rights, which are redeemable, will become exercisable only in the event that any person or group becomes a holder of 15% or more of the Common Stock, or commences a tender or exchange offer, which, if consummated, would result in that person or group owning at least 15% of the Common Stock. Once the Rights become exercisable, they entitle all other stockholders to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a new series of junior participating preferred stock for an exercise price of $48.00. The Rights will expire on August 5, 2004, unless exchanged earlier or redeemed earlier by the Company for $.01 per Right at any time before public disclosure that a 15% position has been acquired. -22-
13. EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data): The diluted earnings per share calculation excludes the dilutive effect of 1,301,000, 1,954,000, and 1,813,000 options for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, because the exercise price was greater than the average market price. The Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock was not included in this calculation as the effect of the conversion was anti-dilutive. 14. DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Real Property Loans--The fair value of all real property loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Working Capital Loans, Construction Loans and Subdebt Investments--The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the interest rates received, which approximates current market rates. Cash and Cash Equivalents--The carrying amount approximates fair value. Marketable Securities--Marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value. Borrowings Under Line of Credit Arrangements --The carrying amount of the lines of credit and secured debt approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate adjustable. Senior Unsecured Notes --The fair value of the senior unsecured notes payable was estimated by discounting the future cash flow using the current borrowing rate available to the Company for similar debt. Mortgage Notes Payable--Mortgage notes payable is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the interest rates paid, which approximates current market rates. -23-
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at December 31, 2001 and 2000, are as follows (in thousands): 15. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS During the nine months ended September 30, 2002, the Company sold seven assisted living facilities and one parcel of land with carrying values of $48,935,000. The rental income, provision for depreciation and allocated interest expense, along with the net gain (loss) on sales, related to these properties for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 16. QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED) The following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 (in thousands, except per share data): -24-
