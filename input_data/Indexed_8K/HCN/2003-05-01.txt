EXHIBIT 99.1 HEALTH CARE REIT, INC. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS Toledo, Ohio, May 1, 2003........HEALTH CARE REIT, INC. (NYSE/HCN) today announced operating results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003. We continue to meet our financial and operational expectations. "We are pleased to report the third consecutive quarter of strong FFO growth, due in large part to our ability to access reasonably priced capital that enables us to fund our investment strategy. Our continued ability to attract capital was evident this quarter with the $100 million unsecured debt offering, an add-on to the original issuance we made during the third quarter of 2002, for an aggregate principal amount of $250 million," commented George L. Chapman, chief executive officer of Health Care REIT, Inc. "We invested $51.6 million with quality operators in competitive facilities. Given our strong pipeline and continued access to the capital markets, we are increasing our gross investment goal for the year to $325 to $350 million." As previously announced, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, of $0.585 per share. The dividend represents the 128th consecutive dividend payment. The dividend will be payable May 20, 2003, to stockholders of record on April 30, 2003. Net income available to common stockholders totaled $16.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2003, compared with $12.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Funds from operations (FFO) totaled $28.1 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2003, compared with $21.2 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. A reconciliation of net income and FFO is presented in Exhibit 14. We had a total outstanding debt balance of $740.8 million at March 31, 2003, as compared with $571.4 million at March 31, 2002, and stockholders' equity of $893.4 million, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 45 percent. The debt to total market capitalization at March 31, 2003 was 38 percent. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest was 3.65 to 1.00 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2003. PORTFOLIO UPDATE. One assisted living facility stabilized during the quarter and four assisted living facilities in fill-up were acquired. We ended the quarter with 20 assisted living facilities remaining in fill-up, representing nine percent of revenues. Only one of these facilities, representing one percent of revenues, has occupancy of less than 50 percent. We recently reported the bankruptcy filing of Doctors Community Health Care Corporation. Based upon a recent appraisal and the historical performance of our facility, we expect to receive payment in full before December 31, 2003, of the outstanding principal and accrued interest, which we believe we are entitled to as
1Q03 Earnings Release May 1, 2003 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- an oversecured creditor. Doctors did not make an interest payment for the first quarter. As previously announced, we do not currently intend to recognize any interest on the loan if payment is not received. We also recently reported the bankruptcy filing of Alterra Healthcare Corporation. Alterra has remained current on rental payments through April 2003 and has acceptable master lease payment coverage of 1.5 times. Alterra filed its plan of reorganization and disclosure statement on March 27, 2003 and indicated its intention to assume the master lease at current rental levels. Based on Alterra's plan and disclosure statement, we expect confirmation in the third quarter. STOCK OPTION EXPENSING. As previously announced, we commenced recognizing compensation expense related to employee stock options on a prospective basis, effective January 1, 2003. We will record the expense related to the 2003 options issued over the option vesting period of five years and will follow the same policy for future stock option issuances. The current year charge is estimated to be $200,000. SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING MEASURE. We believe that FFO is an important supplemental measure because it is the generally accepted measure of operating performance for the real estate investment trust industry. Along with cash flow provided from operating activities, we consider FFO a supplemental measure of our ability to service debt, to make dividend payments and to fund other cash needs. We primarily utilize FFO to analyze the relationship between dividend payments and FFO to measure our desired payout ratio. We generally use the definition of FFO prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of profitability or cash flow provided from operating activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Additionally, FFO, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts. OUTLOOK FOR 2003. We expect to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share and FFO in the range of $2.78 to $2.83 per diluted share for the year 2003. The guidance assumes gross investments of $325 to $350 million, net investments of $250 million and non-recognition of interest income on the mortgage loan with Doctors Community Health Care Corporation. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income and FFO. DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN. We have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement that amends our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan. Once the registration statement is effective, existing stockholders will be able to purchase up to $5,000 of common stock per month at a discount, currently set at 4%. Additionally, investors who are not stockholders of the company may use this plan to make an initial investment in the company. We have the discretion to grant waivers for purchases in excess of $5,000 per month. CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION. We have scheduled a conference call on May 2, 2003, at 11:00 A.M. EDST to discuss our first quarter 2003 results, industry trends, portfolio performance and outlook for the remainder of 2003.
