Exhibit 99.1 [HEALTH CARE REIT LOGO] F O R I M M E D I A T E R E L E A S E MAY 12, 2003 FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: RAY BRAUN - (419) 247-2800 MIKE CRABTREE - (419) 247-2800 HEALTH CARE REIT, INC. ANNOUNCES RESULTS OF PROXY PROPOSALS TOLEDO, OHIO, MAY 12, 2003 - Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE/HCN) announced the results of its Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on Thursday, May 1, 2003. The following proposals submitted at the meeting were approved: - The election of three directors for a term of three years; - The amendment to the second restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, from 75,000,000 to 125,000,000; and - The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as independent auditors for the fiscal year 2003. The annual meeting was adjourned until May 23, 2003 at 10:00 a.m., in order to continue the consideration of the proposal to amend its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of preferred stock. The reconvened meeting will be held on May 23, 2003, at 10:00 a.m. in the Auditorium of One SeaGate, Toledo, Ohio. The sole purpose of the meeting will be to consider the proposal to amend the company's certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of preferred stock from 10,000,000 to 25,000,000. No other business will take place at the reconvened meeting. The board of directors of Health Care REIT, Inc. has unanimously recommended a vote FOR amending the certificate to increase the number of authorized shares of preferred stock because the board believes it will provide the company with greater flexibility in connection with future transactions or other corporate purposes. The board of directors intends to use the increase in the number of shares of preferred stock for capital formation purposes rather than anti-takeover purposes so that any series of the newly authorized shares will not have voting power that exceeds the shares' economic interest in the company, consistent with past issuances by the company of shares of preferred stock.
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), widely recognized as the leading independent proxy advisory firm in the nation, has recommended that Health Care REIT, Inc. stockholders vote FOR this proposal. Stockholders as of the original record date of March 6, 2003 will be entitled to vote by proxy, or in person at the reconvened meeting. It is not necessary for stockholders who have already voted by proxy to take any further action. Questions regarding the voting of shares may be directed towards the company's proxy solicitor, Mellon Investor Services, at (800)-261-8056 (toll free) or (201)-373-5156 (call collect).
