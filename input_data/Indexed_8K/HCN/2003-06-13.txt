(vi) The financial statements of the Company, together with related notes and schedules as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, present fairly the financial position and the results of operations of the Company at the indicated dates and for the indicated periods. Such financial statements and the related notes and schedules have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied throughout the periods involved, and all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results for such periods have been made.

(vii) There is no action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or involving any property of the Company before any court or administrative agency which might reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in the Registration Statement. 3

The leases, agreements to purchase and mortgages to which the Company is a party, and the guaranties of third parties (a) are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, of all other parties thereto, and the Company knows of no default or defenses currently existing with respect thereto which might reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect, and (b) conform to the descriptions thereof set forth in the Registration Statement.

The consummation of the transactions herein contemplated and the fulfillment of the terms hereof will not conflict with or constitute a violation of any statute or conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or the Company's properties may be bound, or of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or the Company's properties or of any court or of any regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body.

(xvi) To the knowledge of the Company, after inquiry of its officers and directors, there are no affiliations with the NASD among the Company's officers, directors, or principal stockholders, except as set forth in the Registration Statement or as otherwise disclosed in writing to the Underwriters. (xvii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (xviii) Neither the Company nor any of its officers or directors has taken nor will any of them take, directly or indirectly, any action resulting in a violation of Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act, or designed to cause or result in, or which has constituted or which reasonably might be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Company's Preferred Stock. The Company acknowledges that the Underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Preferred Stock, including stabilizing bids, syndicate covering transactions and the imposition of penalty bids.

The Representatives may from time to time thereafter change the public offering price and other selling terms. 4. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. The Company covenants and agrees with the Underwriters that: (i) The Company will (a) prepare and timely file with the Commission under Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations, if the final form of the prospectus is not included in the Registration Statement at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective, a Prospectus containing information previously omitted at the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement in reliance on Rule 430A, if applicable, of the Rules and Regulations, (b) use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to remain in effect as to the Shares for so long as the Representatives may deem necessary in order to complete the distribution of the Shares, (c) not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus, or document incorporated by reference therein, of which the Representatives shall not previously have been advised and furnished with a copy or to which the Representatives shall have reasonably objected in writing or which is not in compliance with the Rules and Regulations for so long as the Representatives may deem necessary in order to complete the distribution of the Shares and (d) file on a timely basis all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and prior to the termination of the offering of the Shares by the Underwriters; provided, however, that for each such report or definitive proxy or information statement, the Company will not file any such report or definitive proxy or information statement, or amendment thereto, of which the Representatives shall not previously have been advised and furnished with a copy or to which the Representatives shall have reasonably objected in writing or which is not in compliance with the Rules and Regulations.

obtain as soon as possible the lifting of any such stop order, if issued, or such suspension of qualification. (iii) The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Representatives, from time to time, as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Representatives during the period when delivery of a Prospectus is required under the Act, as many copies of the Prospectus in final form, or as thereafter amended or supplemented, as the Representatives may reasonably request.

(iv) Subject to the provisions of Section 4(i) above, if during the period in which a prospectus is required by law to be delivered by an Underwriter or a dealer any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or, if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with law. (v) The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the Exchange Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement in conformity with Rule 158 under the Act for the purposes of, and to provide the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the Act. (vi) The Company will, for a period of five years from the Closing Date, deliver to the Representatives copies of annual reports and copies of all other documents, reports and information furnished by the Company to its stockholders or filed with any securities exchange pursuant to the requirements of such exchange or with the Commission pursuant to the Act or the Exchange Act. The Company will deliver to the Representatives similar reports with respect to significant subsidiaries, as that term is defined in the Rules and Regulations, which are not consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

(h) The statements under the caption "Certain Government Regulations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any amendments thereto, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 as to matters of law stated therein, have been reviewed by such counsel and constitute fair summaries of the matters described therein which are material to the business or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company. (i) Such counsel does not know of any contracts or documents required to be filed as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto which are not so filed, incorporated by reference or described as required, and such contracts and documents as are summarized in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto are fairly summarized in all material respects. 9
(j) Such counsel knows of no material legal proceedings pending or threatened against the Company except as set forth in the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto. (k) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated do not and will not conflict with or constitute a violation of any statute or conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, any material agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or the Company's properties may be bound or any order known to such counsel or rule or regulation applicable to the Company or the Company's properties of any court or governmental agency or body. (l) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (m) No approval, consent, order, authorization, designation, declaration or filing by or with any regulatory, administrative or other governmental body is necessary in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated (other than (i) the filing of a supplement to the Prospectus with the Commission, and (ii) as may be required by the NASD or as required by state securities and Blue Sky laws as to which such counsel need express no opinion) except such as have been obtained or made by the Company, specifying the same. (n) The Company is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, either such counsel or Arnold & Porter, special tax counsel to the Company, will provide an opinion, based on such counsel's own review of the Company's certificate of incorporation, stating that the Company was organized and continues to be organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code") and, based on such counsel's review of the Company's federal income tax returns and discussions with management and independent public accountants for the Company, that the Company, taking into account operations for its taxable and fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 through December 31, 2002, satisfied the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for such years and that its proposed method of operation will enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for its taxable and fiscal year ending December 31, 2003. Furthermore, such counsel shall opine that the statements contained under the headings "Additional U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and "REIT Qualification" in the Registration Statement or Prospectus and under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any amendments, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax treatment of the Company and of its stockholders. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters governed by the laws of states other than the laws of State of Ohio, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware or Federal laws on local counsel in such jurisdictions, provided that in such case such counsel shall state that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying on such 10
other counsel and such other counsel shall indicate that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion. As to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, such counsel may rely on certificates of officers of the Company and public officials so long as such counsel states that they have no reason to believe that either the Representatives or they are not justified in relying on such certificates. In addition to the matters set forth above, the opinion of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP shall also include a statement to the effect that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which leads them to believe that (a) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, as of the time it became effective under the Act, or any of the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus after the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as of the respective date when such documents were filed with the Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (b) the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, on the date it was filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (y) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or any of the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus after the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as of the respective date when such documents were filed with the Commission, or as of the Closing Date, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements, schedules and other financial information included therein), and (z) the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, as of the date it was filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), or as of the Closing Date, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements, schedules and other financial information included therein). With respect to such statement, Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP, may state that this statement is based upon the procedures set forth or incorporated by reference therein, but is without independent check and verification. (iv) The Representatives shall have received from Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion dated the Closing Date with respect to the organization of the Company, the validity of the Shares, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives reasonably may request and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters. (v) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a letter or letters, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, dated the date hereof (i) confirming that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Act and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission and (ii) stating, as of the date hereof (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given in the Prospectus, as of a date not more than five days prior to the date hereof), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters ordinarily covered by accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings. 11
(vi) With respect to the letter or letters of Ernst & Young LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Representatives concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letters"), the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter (the "bring-down letter") of such accountants, dated the Closing Date, (i) confirming that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Act and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (ii) stating, as of the date of the bring-down letter (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given in the Prospectus, as of a date not more than five days prior to the date of the bring-down letter), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters covered by the initial letters and (iii) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letters. (vii) The Representatives shall have received on the Closing Date, a certificate or certificates of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that as of the Closing Date, each of them severally represents as follows: (a) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceedings for such purpose have been taken or are, to his knowledge, contemplated by the Commission. (b) He does not know of any litigation instituted or threatened against the Company of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not so disclosed; he does not know of any material contract required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement which is not so filed; and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 1 hereof are true and correct as of the Closing Date. (c) He has carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in his opinion, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, were true and correct, and such Registration Statement and Prospectus, or any document incorporated by reference therein, did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and, in his opinion, since the effective date of the Registration Statement, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Prospectus which has not been so set forth in such supplement or amendment. (viii) The Shares to be sold by the Company as of the Closing Date, shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange. The opinions and certificates mentioned in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in all material respects reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives and to Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriters. If any of the conditions hereinabove provided for in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement to be fulfilled, the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notifying the Company of such termination in 12
writing or by telegram at or prior to the Closing Date. In such event, the Company and the Underwriters shall not be under any obligation to each other (except to the extent provided in Sections 5 and 8 hereof). 7. CONDITIONS OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. The obligations of the Company to sell and deliver the portion of the Shares required to be delivered as and when specified in this Agreement are subject to the conditions that at the Closing Date, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and in effect or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened. 8. INDEMNIFICATION. (i) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its officer and directors, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (b) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made, or (c) any act or failure to act, or any alleged act or failure to act by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Shares or the offering contemplated hereby, and will reimburse each such Underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof; and provided further that as to any Preliminary Prospectus this indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter, its officers and directors, or any person controlling the Underwriter on account of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of any Shares to any person by that Underwriter if that Underwriter failed to send or give a copy of the Prospectus, as the same may be amended or supplemented, to that person within the time required by the Act, and the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus, unless such failure resulted from non-compliance by the Company with Sections 4(iii), 4(iv) or 4(v). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (ii) Each Underwriter severally and jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the 13
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have. (iii) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing. No indemnification provided for in Sections 8(i) or (ii) shall be available to any party who shall fail to give notice as provided in this Section 8(iii) if the party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and was prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, but the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on account of the provisions of Sections 8(i) or (ii). In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event (a) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (b) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit notwithstanding its obligation to bear the fees and expenses of such counsel. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties and one local counsel. Such firm shall be designated in writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(i) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(ii). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the fifth sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent to which the indemnification obligations of the Company hereunder are applicable if (a) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of 14
the aforesaid request and (b) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless to the extent required therein an indemnified party under Sections 8(i) or (ii) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(iii) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Underwriters bear to the total proceeds of the offering (the proceeds received by the Underwriters being equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters), in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(iv) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(iv). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(iv) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(iv), (a) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Shares purchased by such Underwriter and (b) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(iv) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (v) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 8 hereby consents to the jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon him or it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join him or it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party. 15

DEFAULT BY UNDERWRITERS. If, at the Closing, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is ten percent or less of the aggregate principal amount of Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives for the purchase of such Shares by other persons (who may include one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, including the Representatives), but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, at the Closing, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the aggregate principal amount of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of Shares to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company 16
for the purchase of such Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 11. Any action taken under this Section 11 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. 12. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors, executors, administrators, heirs and assigns, and the officers, directors and controlling persons referred to herein, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. The term "successors" shall not include any purchaser of the Shares merely because of such purchase. 13. MISCELLANEOUS. The reimbursement, indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Agreement and the representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person thereof, or by or on behalf of the Company or its directors or officers and (iii) delivery of and payment for the Shares under this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 17

(b) The phrase "the aggregate amount set forth opposite such Bank's name on the signature pages hereof under the caption 'Revolving Credit Commitment'" appearing in the definition of the term "Revolving Credit Commitment" in Article 1 shall be deemed to refer to the amount set forth opposite each Bank's name on the signature pages hereto. (c) The definition of "Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date" appearing in Article 1 is deleted in its entirety and the following is substituted therefor: "'Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date' - initially, May 15, 2006, or any later date established in accordance with Section 2.23 hereof." (d) The definition of "Total Revolving Credit Commitment" appearing in Article 1 is deleted in its entirety and the following is substituted therefor: "'Total Revolving Credit Commitment' - the aggregate obligation of the Banks to make Loans hereunder up to the aggregate amount of Two Hundred Twenty-Five Million ($225,000,000) Dollars."

Each Substituted Note shall be dated the date of Amendment No. 1, shall be payable to the order of such Bank in a principal amount equal to such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment as in effect on the date of Amendment No. 1, and shall otherwise be duly completed. The Substituted Notes shall be payable as provided in Sections 2.1 and 2.5 hereof." (f) Section 2.23 is amended by deleting the first sentence thereof in its entirety and substituting therefor the following: "Subject to the following provisions, the Borrowers shall have the option to extend the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date to May 15, 2007."

"(a) The Borrowers may one time, at their sole expense and effort and after consulting with the Agent, request: (i) one or more Banks acceptable to the Agent to increase (in the sole and absolute discretion of each such Bank) the amount of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments, and/or (ii) one or more other lending institutions acceptable to the Agent (each, a "NEW 3
LENDER") to become "Banks" and extend Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder (each such existing Bank and each New Lender being referred to as a "PROPOSED LENDER"). To request an increase pursuant to this Section 2.24 (the "COMMITMENT INCREASE"), the Borrowers shall submit to the Agent a written increase request signed by the Borrowers and in form approved by the Agent (the "INCREASE REQUEST"), which shall specify, as the case may be: (A) each such existing Bank and the amount of the proposed increase to its Revolving Credit Commitment, or (B) the proposed Revolving Credit Commitment for each New Lender. Promptly following receipt of the Increase Request, the Agent shall advise each Proposed Lender of the details thereof. (b) If one or more Proposed Lender(s) shall have unconditionally agreed to such Increase Request in a writing delivered to the Borrowers and the Agent at any time prior to the 30th day following the date of the delivery to such Proposed Lenders(s) of the Increase Request (each such Proposed Lender being hereinafter referred to as an "INCREMENTAL LENDER"), then: (x) each such Incremental Lender which shall then be an existing Bank shall have its Revolving Credit Commitment increased by the amount set forth in the Increase Request, and (y) each such Incremental Lender which shall then be a New Lender shall be and become a "Bank" hereunder having a Revolving Credit Commitment equal to the amount set forth in such Increase Request, provided, however, that (1) immediately before and after giving effect thereto, no Default shall or would exist, (2) each such Incremental Lender shall have executed and delivered to the Agent a supplement to this Agreement providing for its increased Revolving Credit Commitment or its Revolving Credit Commitment, as applicable, in form approved by the Agent, (3) immediately after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment shall not exceed $300,000,000, (4) the increase of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment specified in the Increase Request shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000, (5) the Revolving Credit Commitment extended by each Incremental Lender which is a New Lender shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (6) the Commitment Increase shall not be permitted hereunder unless consummated on or prior to December 31, 2003. (c) Simultaneously with the Commitment Increase under this Section 2.24, each Incremental Lender shall, to the extent necessary, purchase from each other existing Bank, and each other existing Bank shall sell to each Incremental Lender, in each case at par and without representation, warranty, or recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.13), such principal amount of Loans of such other existing Bank(s), together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as will result, after giving effect to such transaction, in each Bank's pro rata share of Loans outstanding being equal to such Lender's pro rata share of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, provided that each such assignor Bank shall have received (to the extent of the interests, rights and obligations assigned) payment then due and owing of the outstanding principal amount of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees, 4
commissions and all other amounts payable to it under the Loan Documents from the applicable assignee Banks (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest, fees and commissions) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts)." SECTION 2.2 In order to evidence the Loans, as amended hereby, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to each Bank, simultaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, a substituted promissory note payable to the order of such Bank in substantially the form of Exhibit A annexed hereto (each a "SUBSTITUTED NOTE" and collectively the "SUBSTITUTED NOTES"). Each of the Banks shall, upon the execution and delivery by the Borrowers of its applicable Substituted Note as herein provided, mark the Note delivered to it in connection with the Original Loan Agreement "Replaced by Substituted Note" and return it to the Borrowers. SECTION 2.3 (a) All references in the Original Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document to the "Revolving Credit Commitment(s)", the "Note(s)" and the "Loan Documents" shall be deemed to refer respectively, to the Revolving Credit Commitment(s) as amended hereby, the Substituted Note(s) and the Loan Documents as defined in the Original Loan Agreement together with, and as amended by this Amendment No. 1, the Substituted Notes and all agreements, documents and instruments delivered pursuant thereto or in connection therewith.

The Tenant is providing indemnification and a defense to HCRI. HCRI is being defended in this
matter by Peter McCormick, Esq., Law Office of Peter Feeherry, 25 New Chardon Street, Boston, MA 02114. HCRI believes plaintiffs' claims as to HCRI are meritless and HCRI will vigorously defend the suit. - - Royal Care Litigation - HCRI has been named as a defendant in six separate suits filed in State Court in Tennessee filed by a seller of six facilities against HCRI and several other defendants.

The Tenant is providing indemnity and a defense to HCRI. The plaintiff and Tenant have allowed all defendants to have extensions of time to answer the complaints because the plaintiffs and Tenant are attempting to negotiate a settlement of the dispute. HCRI believes plaintiffs' claims as to HCRI are meritless and HCRI will vigorously defend each of the suits. - - Windmoor - HCRI has been notified that it and other parties are the subject of a federal "qui tam" whistleblower lawsuit filed by an undisclosed relator in the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, under the federal False Claims Act, which claim relates to the appropriateness of Medicare reimbursement in the amount of approximately $2.6M resulting from the sale of two facilities in 1997. Possible penalties under the False Claims Act include treble damages. The action was filed under seal, which is the normal procedure for such "qui tam" cases, and further information is unavailable at this time. The United States Attorney's office is investigating the allegations, and has not made a decision whether the United States will join in the action. HCRI's attorneys are working with the federal government representatives to give them the information necessary to assess the allegations. It is HCRI's belief that the payments were appropriate and that the allegations are baseless. HCRI intends to fully defend against these claims.

All indebtedness outstanding under this Substituted Note shall bear interest (computed in the same manner as interest on this Substituted Note prior to the relevant due date) at the applicable Post-Default Rate for all periods when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, commencing on the occurrence of such Event of Default until such Event of Default has been cured or waived as acknowledged in writing by the Agent, and all of such interest shall be payable on demand. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligation of the Borrowers to make payments of interest shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required to be made to the Bank to the extent that the Bank's receipt thereof would not be permissible under the law or laws applicable to the Bank limiting rates of interest which may be charged or collected by the Bank. Any such payments of interest which are not made as a result of the limitation referred to in the preceding sentence shall be made by the Borrowers to the Bank on the earliest interest payment date or dates on which the receipt thereof would be permissible under the laws applicable to the Bank limiting rates of interest which may be charged or collected by the Bank.

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.

Exhibit 10.2 CREDIT AGREEMENT This Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of the 31st day of May, 2003, by and between HEALTH CARE REIT, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Borrower") and FIFTH THIRD BANK, an Ohio banking corporation ("Bank"). Section 1. Definitions. All financial terms used in the Agreement but not defined in the Loan Documents have the meanings given to them by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). All other undefined terms have the meanings given to them in the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code. Section 2. Loan. 2.01. Revolving Credit Loan. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Bank hereby extends to Borrower a line of credit facility (the "Facility") (the "Loan") under which Bank may make loans (the Revolving Loans") to Borrower at Borrower's request from time to time during the term of this Agreement. Bank will have discretion at all times as to whether or not to make any Revolving Loan, if there is any Event of Default. Borrower may borrow, prepay, and reborrow under the Facility, provided that the principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding at any one time under the Facility will not exceed the foregoing limits or those limits specified in the Revolving Note. If the amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding at any time under the Facility exceeds the limits set forth above or in the Revolving Note, Borrower will immediately pay the amount of such excess to Bank. Bank has agreed to make this loan upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and all documents executed pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement (all such documents and this Agreement will be called ("Loan Documents"), provided the loan is secured as set forth in this Agreement. (b) Borrower may request a Revolving Loan by written or telephone notice to Bank. Bank will make a Revolving Loan by wire transfer to any account designated by Borrower. Loan proceeds may be used for purposes not prohibited herein. (c) On the date hereof, Borrower will duly issue and deliver to Bank a Revolving Note (the "Revolving Note"), in the principal amount of THIRTY MILLION and 00/100 DOLLARS ($30,000,000.00) bearing interest as specified in Section 2.02 herein. (d) The term of the Facility will expire on MAY 31, 2004 and the Revolving Note will become payable in full on that date. 2.03 Interest on Revolving Credit Loan. The principal amounts outstanding hereunder shall bear interest commencing on the date of the first advance hereunder at the rate or rates per annum set forth below which shall be designated by Borrower as more fully set forth herein. At any time, from time to time, during the term of this note, so long as no Event of Default exists and so long as such Borrowings are not then subject to an Interest Rate Election, Borrower may notify Bank that it wishes to exercise its right to adjust the rate of interest accruing on some or all amounts of principal outstanding under this Note (in a minimum amount of $500,000.00) to one of the rates set forth below, however, once the rate of interest accruing against any amounts outstanding hereunder is adjusted to one of the following interest rates during an Interest Period, Borrower may not elect to adjust such interest rate to a different interest rate until the expiration of such Interest Period: (a) LIBOR Rate. Upon telephonic notice by Borrower to Bank, Borrower may elect to have all or any portion of the Borrowings in a minimum amount of $500,000.00 per election bear interest at the per annum rate equal to two hundred basis points (200) in excess of the LIBOR Rate (a "LIBOR Rate Election"). Such notice shall inform Bank of the amount of Borrowings to be subject to the LIBOR Rate Election, the LIBOR interest period and the effective date of the LIBOR interest period. 1
Borrower's right to make a LIBOR Rate Election shall be terminated automatically if Bank, by telephonic notice, shall notify Borrower that LIBOR deposits with a maturity corresponding to the maturity of the LIBOR Interest Period, in an amount equal to the Borrowings to be subject to the LIBOR Rate Election are not readily available in the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate Market, or that, by reason of circumstances affecting such Market, adequate and reasonable methods do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such deposits for the proposed LIBOR Interest Period. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if, prior to or during any period with respect to which a LIBOR Rate is in effect, any change in any law, regulation or official directive, or in the interpretation thereof, by any governmental body charged with the administration thereof, shall make it unlawful for the Bank to find or maintain its funding in Eurodollars of any portion of the Borrowings subject to the LIBOR Rate or otherwise to give effect to Bank's obligations as contemplated hereby, (i) Bank may by written notice to Borrower, declare Bank's obligations in respect of the LIBOR Rate to be terminated forthwith, and (ii) the LIBOR Rate with respect to Bank shall forthwith cease to be in effect, and interest shall from and after such date be calculated at Prime Rate, unless Borrower shall thereafter elect one or more other Interest Rate Election. (b) Prime Rate. Upon telephonic notice by Borrower to Bank prior to or on the Effective Date, Borrower may elect to have all or part of the Borrowings (provided such Borrowings are not then subject to an Interest Rate Election) bear interest at the per annum rate equal to the Prime Rate ("Prime Rate Election"). Such telephonic notice shall inform Bank of the amount of the Borrowings to be subject to the Prime Rate Election, the Prime Rate Interest Period and the Effective Date for the Prime Rate Interest Period. If at any time during the term hereof (i) the outstanding principal hereunder is less than $500,000.00, or (ii) Borrower fails to designate one of the interest rates set forth above or at any time after Borrower has elected to adjust the interest rate accruing on any principal outstanding hereunder to a rate other than the fixed rate set forth above, at the expiration of any Interest Period, if Borrower has not made another Interest Rate Election hereunder, then in either such event, such outstanding amounts of principal will accrue interest at a rate of interest equal to the Prime Rate. As used herein, the following terms will have the meanings set forth below: (a) "Effective Date" means the date on which a LIBOR Rate Election or Prime Rate Election will begin. (b) "Interest Rate Election" means a LIBOR Rate Election, or a Prime Rate Election or any one or more of the foregoing. (c) "LIBOR Interest Period" means, with respect to a Borrowing elected to accrue interest at the LIBOR Rate, a period of 30, 60 or 90 days commencing on a business day selected by the Borrower pursuant to this Note. Such LIBOR Interest Period shall end on the day in the succeeding calendar month which corresponds numerically to the beginning day of such LIBOR Interest Period, provided, however, that if there is no such numerically corresponding day in such succeeding month, such LIBOR Interest Period shall end on the last business day of such succeeding month. If a LIBOR Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a business day, such LIBOR Interest Period shall end on the next succeeding business day, provided, however, that if said next succeeding business day falls in a new month, such LIBOR Interest Period shall end on the immediately preceding business day. 2.03 Statements. After the end of each quarter, Bank will render to Borrower a statement on each of Borrower's loan accounts with Bank hereunder, which statement will be considered correct and will be conclusively binding upon Borrower unless Borrower notifies Bank in writing of any discrepancy within thirty (30) days from the date of such statement. 2

Section 4. Affirmative Covenants. 4.01 Affirmative Covenants.

After the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Bank may increase the interest rate on any loan in accordance with the provisions of any note evidencing the loan. This provision does not constitute a waiver of any Events of Default or an agreement by Bank to permit any late payments whatsoever. 5.05 Late Payment Penalty. If any payment is not paid when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), Borrower agrees to pay to Bank a late payment fee equal to five percent (5%) of the payment amount, with a minimum fee of $20.00. 5.06 No Remedy Exclusive. No remedy set forth herein is exclusive of any other available remedy or remedies, but each is cumulative and in addition to every other remedy available under this Agreement, the Loan Documents or as maybe now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute. Borrower waives any requirement of marshalling of assets which may be secured by any of the Loan Documents. 5.07 Effect of Termination. The termination of this Agreement will not affect any rights of either party or any obligation of either party to the other, arising prior to the effective date of such termination, and the provisions hereof shall continue to be fully operative until all transactions entered into, rights created or Obligations incurred prior to such termination have been fully disposed of, concluded or liquidated.

Section 7. Miscellaneous Provisions. 7.01 Miscellaneous. This Agreement, the exhibits and the other Loan Documents are the complete agreement of the parties hereto and supersede all previous understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

No delay or omission on the part of Bank in exercising any right, remedy or power arising from any Event of Default will impair any such right, remedy or power; or any other right, remedy or power to be considered a waiver; or any right, remedy or power or any Event of Default nor will the action or omission to act by Bank upon the occurrence of any Event of Default impair any right, remedy or power arising as a result thereof or affect any subsequent Event of Default of the same or different nature. 7.07 Notices.
