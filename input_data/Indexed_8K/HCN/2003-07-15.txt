EXHIBIT 99.1 HEALTH CARE REIT, INC. REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS Toledo, Ohio, July 15, 2003........HEALTH CARE REIT, INC. (NYSE/HCN) today announced operating results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2003. We continue to meet our financial and operational expectations. "We are pleased to report the fourth consecutive quarter of strong quarter over prior year quarter FFO growth," commented George L. Chapman, chief executive officer of Health Care REIT, Inc. "We believe that this growth, coupled with our strong investment pipeline, should enable us to reach our goal of driving our FFO payout ratio to the low 80 percent level within the next several quarters. During the second quarter, we completed $132.1 million of solid investments that further strengthen and diversify our portfolio. Our continued access to the capital markets, combined with our strong relationships with operators, enables us to successfully close new investments." The Board of Directors declared a dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 of $0.585 per share. The dividend represents the 129th consecutive dividend payment. The dividend will be payable August 20, 2003 to stockholders of record on July 31, 2003. SUMMARY OF SECOND QUARTER RESULTS - --------------------------------- (In thousands, except per share data) Net income available to common stockholders totaled $16.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2003, compared with $13.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Funds from operations totaled $28.6 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2003, compared with $23.9 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. SUMMARY OF YEAR TO DATE RESULTS - ------------------------------- (In thousands, except per share data) Page 1 of 12
2Q03 Earnings Release July 15, 2003 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net income available to common stockholders totaled $33.2 million, or $0.81 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2003, compared with $26.0 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Funds from operations totaled $56.7 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2003, compared with $45.1 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. We had a total outstanding debt balance of $833.5 million at June 30, 2003, as compared with $576.0 million at June 30, 2002, and stockholders' equity of $895.3 million, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 48 percent. The debt to total market capitalization at June 30, 2003 was 38 percent. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest was 3.50 to 1.00 for the six months ended June 30, 2003. PORTFOLIO UPDATE. Two assisted living facilities stabilized during the quarter and no assisted living facilities in fill-up were acquired. We ended the quarter with 18 assisted living facilities remaining in fill-up, representing eight percent of revenues. None of these facilities has occupancy of less than 50 percent. Previously we reported on the impact of the bankruptcy filings of Doctors Community Health Care Corporation and Alterra Healthcare Corporation. At this time, there is no additional information to report. SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING MEASURES. FFO stands for funds from operations, the generally accepted measure of operating performance for the real estate investment trust industry. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that FFO and EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, are important supplemental measures because they provide investors an indication of our ability to service debt, to make dividend payments and to fund other cash needs. We primarily utilize FFO to measure our payout ratio which represents dividends paid per share divided by FFO per diluted share. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense. FFO and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Additionally, FFO and EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 14 and 16 for reconciliations of FFO and EBITDA to net income. OUTLOOK FOR 2003. We expect to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share and FFO in the range of $2.78 to $2.83 per diluted share for the year 2003. The guidance assumes gross investments of $325-350 million, net investments of $250 million and non-recognition of interest income on the mortgage loan with Doctors Community Health Care Corporation. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income and FFO. DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN. As previously announced, we have implemented our new, enhanced dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan. Existing stockholders are now able to purchase up to $5,000 of common stock per month at a discount, currently set at four percent. Additionally, investors who are not stockholders of the company may use this plan to make an initial investment in the company. We have the discretion to grant waivers for purchases in excess of $5,000 per month. CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION. We have scheduled a conference call on July 16, 2003, at 11:00 A.M.
