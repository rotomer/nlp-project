REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS THIRD QUARTER FFO OF $0.72 PER DILUTED SHARE EXCLUDING PREFERRED STOCK REDEMPTION CHARGE Toledo, Ohio, October 22, 2003........HEALTH CARE REIT, INC. (NYSE/HCN) today announced operating results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2003. We continue to meet our financial and operational expectations. "Fueled by the significant investments totaling $340 million during the quarter, we are pleased to report that we have reached $2 billion in total assets while continuing to drive FFO growth," commented George L. Chapman, chief executive officer of Health Care REIT, Inc. "We have benefited from attractive acquisition opportunities, the continued confidence of the capital markets and our recent upgrade to investment grade status by Moody's. Excluding the impact of a non-cash, non-recurring charge from our recent preferred stock redemption, we continue to demonstrate positive FFO growth and payout ratio trends." The Board of Directors declared a dividend for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 of $0.585 per share. The dividend represents the 130th consecutive dividend payment. The dividend will be payable November 20, 2003 to stockholders of record on November 3, 2003. SUMMARY OF THIRD QUARTER RESULTS (In thousands, except per share data) PAGE 1 OF 13
3Q03 EARNINGS RELEASE OCTOBER 22, 2003 Net income available to common stockholders totaled $20.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2003, compared with $16.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002.

Adjusted funds from operations, which excludes the preferred stock redemption charge, totaled $32.4 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2003. SUMMARY OF YEAR TO DATE RESULTS (In thousands, except per share data) Net income available to common stockholders totaled $53.8 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, compared with $42.9 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Funds from operations totaled $86.3 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, compared with $70.8 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Adjusted funds from operations, which excludes the preferred stock redemption charge, totaled $89.0 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. We had a total outstanding debt balance of $903.2 million at September 30, 2003, as compared with $639.5 million at September 30, 2002, and stockholders' equity of $1.1 billion, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 45 percent. The debt to total market capitalization at September 30, 2003 was 36 percent. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest was 3.64 to 1.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. PORTFOLIO UPDATE. Two assisted living facilities stabilized during the quarter and one assisted living facility in fill-up was opened after completion of construction. We ended the quarter with 17 assisted living facilities remaining in fill-up, representing nine percent of revenues. Only the facility that recently opened, representing one percent of revenues, has occupancy of less than 50 percent. As previously announced, Alterra Healthcare Corporation (Alterra) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 22, 2003. A joint venture between Fortress Investment Group LLC and Emeritus Corporation was the winning bidder at an auction held on July 17, 2003. The $76 million acquisition was approved by the bankruptcy court on July 23, 2003. Subject to confirmation of Alterra's plan of reorganization, our master lease should be assumed by the reorganized Alterra at current rental levels. A hearing on confirmation of Alterra's plan of reorganization is scheduled for October 24, 2003. Alterra has remained current on rental payments throughout the bankruptcy process. PAGE 2 OF 13
3Q03 EARNINGS RELEASE OCTOBER 22, 2003 Also, as previously announced, Doctors Community Health Care Corporation (Doctors) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 20, 2002. The assets of the Doctors debtors are currently out for bid under bankruptcy court supervision. Doctors anticipates a confirmation hearing on its plan of reorganization to be held on December 10, 2003. Doctors did not make an interest payment for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. We believe we are entitled to all accrued but unrecognized interest, however, as previously stated, we do not currently intend to recognize any interest on the loan if payment is not received. SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING MEASURES. FFO stands for funds from operations, the generally accepted measure of operating performance for the real estate investment trust industry. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that FFO and EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, are important supplemental measures because they provide investors an indication of our ability to service debt, to make dividend payments and to fund other cash needs. We primarily utilize FFO to measure our payout ratio which represents dividends paid per share divided by FFO per diluted share. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense. FFO and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Additionally, FFO and EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 14 and 16 for reconciliations of FFO and EBITDA to net income. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In August, we lowered net income guidance as a result of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarification of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic D-42. To implement the clarified accounting pronouncement, our third quarter results reflect a reduction in net income available to common stockholders resulting from a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2.79 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, due to the redemption of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. At that time, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) had not definitively pronounced the impact of this accounting clarification on its definition of FFO. Subsequently, NAREIT has issued its recommendation that preferred stock redemption charges should not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. We have adopted this recommendation; however, we have also disclosed FFO adjusted for the preferred stock redemption charge for enhanced clarity. In October, NAREIT informed its member companies that the SEC is likely to change its position on certain aspects of the NAREIT FFO definition, including impairment charges. Previously, the SEC accepted NAREIT's view that impairment charges are effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an impending sale of property and thus should be excluded from FFO similar to other gains and losses on sales. However, the SEC's clarified interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. Based on the SEC's interpretation, we have restated our prior year FFO amounts to exclude impairment charges. This modification of FFO does not impact our net income. OUTLOOK FOR 2003. We are revising our guidance to reflect the significant investment activity closed during the third quarter and the impact of recent accounting pronouncements. We expect to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.69 to $1.72 per diluted share, and FFO in the range of $2.77 to $2.80 per diluted share for the year 2003. Excluding the impact of the preferred stock redemption charge, we expect to report adjusted FFO in the range of $2.83 to $2.86 per diluted share for the year 2003. The guidance assumes gross investments of $575-625 million, net investments of $500 million and non-recognition of interest income on the mortgage loan with Doctors Community Health Care Corporation. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income and FFO. OUTLOOK FOR 2004. We are introducing guidance for the year 2004. We expect to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.71 to $1.76 per diluted share, and FFO in the range of $3.01 to $3.06 per diluted share for the year 2004. The guidance assumes net investments of $200 million. PAGE 3 OF 13
3Q03 EARNINGS RELEASE OCTOBER 22, 2003 Additionally, we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile.
