One of these new rules, Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), provides an exemption to the insider trading rules in the form of an affirmative defense. Rule 10b5-1 recognizes the creation of formal programs under which executives and other insiders may sell the securities of publicly traded companies on a regular basis pursuant to written plans that are entered into at a time when the plan participants are not aware of material non-public information and that otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. On January 28, 2003, the Board of Directors of Health Care REIT, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a resolution modifying its insider trading policy to allow insiders to sell securities of the Company pursuant to pre-arranged trading plans. As previously reported, effective February 5, 2003, Raymond W. Braun, President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and Erin C. Ibele, Vice President and Corporate Secretary of the Company, adopted individualized trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the 1934 Act. Effective November 12, 2003, Mr. Braun modified his plan pursuant to which he instructed his broker to exercise options and sell up to 149,156 shares of the Company's common stock during the period between December 15, 2003 and December 31, 2004. The number of shares to be exercised and sold under Mr. Braun's plan ranges from 9,559 to 22,000 shares per month, not including any unsold shares that might be carried over from a previous month. Effective November 12, 2003, Ms. Ibele entered into a new plan pursuant to which she instructed her broker to exercise options and sell up to 42,172 shares of the Company's common stock during the period between February 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004. The number of shares to be exercised and sold under Ms. Ibele's plan ranges from 2,172 to 4,000 shares per month, not including any unsold shares that might be carried over from a previous month.
