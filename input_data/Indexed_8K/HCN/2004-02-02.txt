REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END RESULTS INCREASES 2004 QUARTERLY DIVIDEND RATE Toledo, Ohio, February 2, 2004........HEALTH CARE REIT, INC. (NYSE/HCN) today announced operating results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003. We continue to meet our financial and operational expectations. "Our overall performance for 2003 was exceptional," commented George L. Chapman, chief executive officer of Health Care REIT, Inc. "We expanded our credit facilities and successfully accessed the capital markets on several occasions, enabling us to complete a record $500 million in net investments. Adjusted FFO increased seven percent over 2002, driving down our adjusted FFO payout ratio to 81 percent for the fourth quarter. As a result of these successes, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the common stock dividend to $0.60 per quarter from $0.585 per quarter commencing with the May 2004 dividend." As previously announced, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 of $0.585 per share. The dividend represents the 131st consecutive dividend payment. The dividend will be payable February 20, 2004 to stockholders of record on January 30, 2004. PAGE 1 OF 13
4Q03 EARNINGS RELEASE FEBRUARY 2, 2004 Net income available to common stockholders totaled $16.9 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $12.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Funds from operations totaled $33.2 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $25.7 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Adjusted funds from operations, which excludes non-cash impairment charges, totaled $36.0 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with $27.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Net income available to common stockholders totaled $70.7 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, compared with $55.2 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Funds from operations totaled $119.5 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, compared with $96.6 million, or $2.59 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Adjusted funds from operations, which excludes the non-cash preferred stock redemption and impairment charges, totaled $125.0 million, or $2.83 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, compared with $98.9 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. We had a total outstanding debt balance of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003, as compared with $676.3 million at December 31, 2002, and stockholders' equity of $1.1 billion, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 47 percent. The debt to total market capitalization at December 31, 2003 was 34 percent. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest was 3.50 to 1.00 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. EXPANSION OF UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT. During December 2003 and January 2004, we expanded our unsecured revolving line of credit from $225 million to $310 million. The existing bank group, in conjunction with two new participants, First Tennessee Bank National Association and LaSalle Bank National Association, provided the additional capacity. DIVIDENDS FOR 2004. The Board of Directors approved a new quarterly dividend rate of $0.60 per share per quarter ($2.40 per share annually), commencing with the May 2004 dividend, up from $0.585, the rate during 2003. Our dividend policy is reviewed annually during the Board of Director's January planning session. The declaration and payment of quarterly dividends remains subject to the review and approval of our Board of Directors. PAGE 2 OF 13
4Q03 EARNINGS RELEASE FEBRUARY 2, 2004 PORTFOLIO UPDATE. Five assisted living facilities stabilized during the quarter and one assisted living facility in fill-up was acquired. We ended the quarter with 13 assisted living facilities remaining in fill-up, representing six percent of revenues. Only two facilities, representing one percent of revenues, have occupancy of less than 50 percent. One facility opened in the third quarter after completion of construction and the other facility was the new acquisition. As previously announced, Alterra Healthcare Corporation (Alterra) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 23, 2003. A joint venture between Fortress Investment Group LLC and Emeritus Corporation was the winning bidder at a bankruptcy auction held on July 17, 2003. The bankruptcy court confirmed Alterra's plan of reorganization on November 26, 2003. In connection with confirmation of Alterra's plan, our master lease was assumed and the acquisition of Alterra by the Fortress-Emeritus joint venture was approved. This transaction has closed. Alterra remained current on rental payments throughout the bankruptcy process and continues to remain current today. Also, as previously announced, Doctors Community Health Care Corporation and its subsidiaries (Doctors) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 20, 2002. Pursuant to procedures approved by the bankruptcy court, the assets of Doctors were the subject of an auction held on December 10 through December 16, 2003. At the conclusion of that auction, the debtors' independent director declared certain members of Doctors' management the winning bidder. Their bid contemplates a reorganization of Doctors and its subsidiaries with new equity and debt capitalization. The results of this auction are subject to bankruptcy court approval, which the debtors have stated they intend to seek in connection with a hearing on the confirmation of the debtors' proposed plan of reorganization. Doctors anticipates that this hearing will occur in March 2004. Doctors did not make an interest payment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Although we believe we are entitled to all accrued but unrecognized interest, we will not recognize any interest on the loan until confirmation of the bankruptcy plan. SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING MEASURES. FFO stands for funds from operations, the generally accepted measure of operating performance for the real estate investment trust industry. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that FFO and EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, are important supplemental measures because they provide investors an indication of our ability to service debt, to make dividend payments and to fund other cash needs. We primarily utilize FFO to measure our payout ratio which represents dividends paid per share divided by FFO per diluted share. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense. FFO and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Additionally, FFO and EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 14 and 16 for reconciliations of FFO and EBITDA to net income. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In August, we lowered net income guidance as a result of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarification of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic D-42. To implement the clarified accounting pronouncement, our 2003 results reflect a reduction in net income available to common stockholders resulting from a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2.79 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, due to the redemption of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) has issued its recommendation that preferred stock redemption charges should not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. Although we have adopted this recommendation, we have also disclosed FFO adjusted for the preferred stock redemption charge for enhanced clarity. In October, NAREIT informed its member companies that the SEC is likely to change its position on certain aspects of the NAREIT FFO definition, including impairment charges. Previously, the SEC accepted NAREIT's view that impairment charges are effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an impending sale of property and thus should be excluded from FFO similar to other gains and losses on sales. However, the SEC's clarified interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. Although we have adopted this interpretation, we have also disclosed FFO adjusted for the impairment charges for enhanced clarity. This modification of FFO does not impact our net income.

4Q03 EARNINGS RELEASE FEBRUARY 2, 2004 OUTLOOK FOR 2004. We are revising our 2004 guidance and expect to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.68 to $1.73 per diluted share, and FFO in the range of $2.99 to $3.04 per diluted share. The adjustment to our previous guidance reflects the anticipated temporary dilution from the excess cash generated by the $250 million senior notes issued in fourth quarter 2003. The guidance assumes no change in our forecast for net investments of $200 million. Additionally, we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income and FFO. CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION. We have scheduled a conference call on February 2, 2004, at 11:00 A.M.
