REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS Toledo, Ohio, May 6, 2004........HEALTH CARE REIT, INC. (NYSE/HCN) today announced operating results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2004. We continue to meet our financial and operational expectations. "We were pleased with our operating results for the quarter," commented George L. Chapman, chief executive officer of Health Care REIT, Inc. "Our $87.3 million of new investments during the first quarter supports our net investment target of $200 million this year. We are well positioned for growth given our solid balance sheet, increased line of credit and our high quality $2 billion portfolio with improving property-level payment coverage ratios." As previously announced, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 of $0.60 per share as compared to $0.585 per share for the same period in 2003. The dividend is a one and one-half cent increase from the dividend paid for the fourth quarter of 2003 and represents the 132nd consecutive dividend payment. The dividend will be payable May 20, 2004 to stockholders of record on April 30, 2004. SUMMARY OF FIRST QUARTER RESULTS (In thousands, except per share data)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net income available to common stockholders totaled $18.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2004, compared with $16.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. Funds from operations totaled $35.8 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2004, compared with $28.1 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. We had a total outstanding debt balance of $1.0 billion at March 31, 2004, as compared with $740.8 million at March 31, 2003, and stockholders' equity of $1.2 billion, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 47 percent. The debt to total market capitalization at March 31, 2004 was 32 percent. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest was 3.11 to 1.00 for the three months ended March 31, 2004. PORTFOLIO UPDATE. Two assisted living facilities stabilized during the quarter. We ended the quarter with 11 assisted living facilities remaining in fill-up, representing six percent of revenues. Only two facilities, representing one percent of revenues, have occupancy of less than 50 percent. One facility opened in the third quarter of 2003 after completion of construction and the other facility was a new acquisition last quarter. As previously announced, Doctors Community Health Care Corporation and its subsidiaries (Doctors) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 20, 2002. Pursuant to procedures approved by the bankruptcy court, the assets of Doctors were the subject of an auction held on December 10 through December 16, 2003. At the conclusion of that auction, the debtors' independent director declared certain members of Doctors' management the winning bidder. Their bid contemplated a reorganization of Doctors and its subsidiaries with new equity and debt capitalization. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, we entered into mortgage financings totaling $22.2 million with the reorganized Doctors. STRAIGHT-LINE RENT. We recorded $6.7 million of straight-line rent for the quarter. Straight-line rent includes $601,000 in cash payments outside the normal monthly rental payments for the three-month period. SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING MEASURES. We believe that net income, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider funds from operations (FFO) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Additionally, we exclude the non-cash provision for loan losses. We believe that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. Additionally, restrictive covenants in our long-term debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense. FFO and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes. Additionally, FFO is an internal evaluation metric utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. FFO and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, FFO and EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 13 and 15 for reconciliations of FFO and EBITDA to net income.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OUTLOOK FOR 2004. We are confirming our 2004 guidance and expect to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.68 to $1.73 per diluted share, and FFO in the range of $2.99 to $3.04 per diluted share. The guidance assumes no change in our forecast for net investments of $200 million. Additionally, we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Please see Exhibit 14 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income and FFO. CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION.
