Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Toledo, Ohio, July 20, 2004........today announced operating results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2004.
Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE/HCN)
"We had a strong quarter of investment activity driving our gross and net new investment total for the first half of 2004 to $161.5 million and 127.7 million, respectively," commented George L. Chapman, chief executive officer of Health Care REIT, Inc. "This first half activity, together with an additional $148.4 million of net new investments to date in the third quarter, allows us to increase our 2004 projected net new investment guidance to $400 million to $500 million. Many of these investments will incorporate rental escalators that enable us to generate additional organic growth and minimize straight-line rent over time. While this change will impact FFO guidance in the short run, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends are unaffected."
The Board of Directors declared a dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 of $0.60 per share as compared to $0.585 per share for the same period in 2003. The dividend represents the 133rd consecutive dividend payment. The dividend will be payable August 20, 2004 to stockholders of record on July 30, 2004.

Summary of Year to Date Results
Net income available to common stockholders totaled $37.9 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2004, compared with $33.2 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003. Funds from operations totaled $71.5 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2004, compared with $56.7 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003.
We had a total outstanding debt balance of $1.0 billion at June 30, 2004, as compared with $833.5 million at June 30, 2003, and stockholders' equity of $1.2 billion, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 47 percent. The debt to total market capitalization at June 30, 2004 was 36 percent. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest was 3.21 to 1.00 for the six months ended June 30, 2004.
We recorded $2.5 million and $9.1 million of straight-line rent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively. Straight-line rent is net of $2.4 million and $3.0 million in cash payments outside the normal monthly rental payments for the three and six month periods, respectively. Based upon a review of the existing portfolio, we reduced our recognition of straight-line rent for the second quarter by $2.5 million.
Straight-line Rent.
Going forward, most of our master leases will incorporate annual rental escalators based on the lesser of a Consumer Price Index factor or a fixed basis point increase. Because the increases are not known at the commencement of the lease, straight-lining the average rental rate over the life of the lease is not required.
Outlook for 2004 and 2005.
Therefore, primarily due to our revised straight-line rent expectations, we are adjusting our 2004 guidance and now expect to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.49 to $1.54 per diluted share, down from $1.68 to $1.73 per diluted share, and FFO in the range of $2.87 to $2.92 per diluted share, down from $2.99 to $3.04 per diluted share. We expect to record straight-line rent of approximately $18 million to $20 million for the full year 2004, down from previous expectations of $24 million to $28 million. These expectations exclude any additional payments outside the normal monthly rental payments. As previously stated, we are also increasing our net new investment guidance for 2004 to a range of $400 million to $500 million.
We are initiating guidance for 2005 and expect to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.47 to $1.55 per diluted share, and FFO in the range of $2.98 to $3.06 per diluted share. The guidance assumes net new investments of $250 million with leases that will not require rents to be straight-lined. We expect to record straight-line rent of approximately $14 million to $16 million for the full year 2005, before any payments outside the normal monthly rental payments.
Our guidance does not account for any impairments or increased quarterly charges to the loan loss reserve. Additionally, we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlooks for net income and FFO.
Eight assisted living facilities stabilized during the quarter and one assisted living facility in fill-up was acquired. We ended the quarter with four assisted living facilities remaining in fill-up, representing two percent of revenues. Only one facility, representing one percent of revenues, has occupancy of less than 50 percent. The facility was a new acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Portfolio Update.
We believe that net income, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider funds from operations (FFO) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
Supplemental Reporting Measures.
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Additionally, we exclude the non-cash provision for loan losses. We believe that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. Additionally, restrictive covenants in our long-term debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense.
FFO and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes. Additionally, FFO is an
 
internal evaluation metric utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. FFO and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, FFO and EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 14 and 16 for reconciliations of FFO and EBITDA to net income.
