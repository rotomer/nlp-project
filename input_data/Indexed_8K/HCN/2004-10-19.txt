Chapman, chief executive officer of Health Care REIT, Inc. "The continued confidence of the capital markets was demonstrated this quarter through our $175 million preferred stock issuance and $50 million unsecured debt issuance, an add-on to the original issuance in the fourth quarter of 2003. We completed $297.5 million of new investments during the quarter, thereby driving our year-to-date gross and net new investment totals to $459 million and $424.1 million, respectively, and supporting our net new investment guidance for full-year 2004 of $400 million to $500 million. We are well positioned for growth given our strong investment pipeline and our continued access to capital."

The company had a total outstanding debt balance of $1.1 billion at September 30, 2004, as compared with $903.2 million at September 30, 2003, and stockholders' equity of $1.3 billion, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 45 percent.

Two assisted living facilities stabilized during the quarter. The company ended the quarter with two assisted living facilities remaining in fill-up, representing one percent of revenues. Both facilities have occupancy of less than 50 percent.
Portfolio Update.
The company recorded $3.0 million and $12.1 million of straight-line rent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, respectively. Straight-line rent is net of $2.1 million and $5.1 million in cash payments outside the normal monthly rental payments for the three and nine month periods, respectively.
Straight-line Rent.
The company is adjusting slightly its 2004 guidance and now expects to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.47 to $1.50 per diluted share, and FFO in the range of $2.85 to $2.87 per diluted share for 2004. Excluding the impact of the impairment charge, the company expects to report adjusted FFO in the range of $2.86 to $2.88 per diluted share for 2004. The company expects to record straight-line rent of approximately $16 million to $18 million for the full year 2004, before any payments outside the normal monthly rental payments. The company is also projecting net new investments for the year between $400 and $500 million.
Outlook for 2004 and 2005.

The company is also reaffirming its 2005 guidance and expects to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.47 to $1.55 per diluted share, and FFO in the range of $2.98 to $3.06 per diluted share. The guidance assumes net new investments of $250 million with leases that will not require rents to be straight-lined. The company expects to record straight-line rent of approximately $14 million to $16 million for the full year 2005, before any payments outside the normal monthly rental payments.
The company's guidance does not account for any impairments or unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve. Additionally, the company plans to manage itself to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with its current profile. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlooks for net income and FFO.
The company believes that net income, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) to be a useful supplemental measure of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
Supplemental Reporting Measures.
In August 2003, the company adopted the SEC clarification of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic D-42. To implement the clarified accounting pronouncement, the company's 2003 results reflect a reduction in net income available to common stockholders resulting from a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2,790,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, due to the redemption of the company's 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in July 2003. NAREIT has issued its recommendation that preferred stock redemption charges should not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. Although the company has adopted this recommendation, it has also disclosed FFO adjusted for the preferred stock redemption charge for enhanced clarity. Additionally, the company believes that the nature of the charge is non-recurring because there was not a similar charge during the two preceding years and the company does not anticipate a similar charge in the succeeding two years.
In October 2003, NAREIT informed its member companies that the SEC had changed its position on certain aspects of the NAREIT FFO definition, including impairment charges. Previously, the SEC accepted NAREIT's view that impairment charges were effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an impending sale of property and thus should be excluded from FFO similar to other gains and losses on sales. However, the SEC's clarified interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. Although the company has adopted this recommendation, it has also disclosed FFO adjusted for the impairment charges for enhanced clarity.
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Additionally, the company excludes the non-cash provision for loan losses. The company believes that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of its operations. Additionally, restrictive covenants in the company's long-term debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. The company primarily utilizes EBITDA to measure its interest coverage ratio which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense.
FFO and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes. Additionally, FFO is an internal evaluation metric utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. FFO and

EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, FFO and EBITDA, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 14 and 16 for reconciliations of FFO and EBITDA to net income.
