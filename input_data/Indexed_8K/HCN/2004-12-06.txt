ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
Effective October 23, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") adopted new rules related to insider trading. One of these new rules, Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), provides an exemption to the insider trading rules in the form of an affirmative defense. Rule 10b5-1 recognizes the creation of formal programs under which executives and other insiders may sell the securities of publicly traded companies on a regular basis pursuant to written plans that are entered into at a time when the plan participants are not aware of material non-public information and that otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1.
On January 28, 2003, the Board of Directors of Health Care REIT, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a resolution modifying its insider trading policy to allow insiders to sell securities of the Company pursuant to pre-arranged trading plans. As previously reported, George L. Chapman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Raymond W. Braun, President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and Erin C. Ibele, Vice President and Corporate Secretary of the Company, adopted individualized trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the 1934 Act.
On December 3, 2004, Mr. Braun entered into a new plan pursuant to which he instructed his broker to exercise options and sell up to 63,156 shares of the Company's common stock during the period between the last trading day of January 2005 and the day before the last trading day of July 2005. Each month, 10,526 shares may be exercised and sold under Mr. Braun's plan, not including any unsold shares that might be carried over from a previous month. Any shares that remain unsold at the end of the six month period described above may be exercised and sold through November 1, 2005.
Reports of the details of actual sales under the plan will be filed by Mr. Braun on Form 4 in accordance with SEC regulations.
