Toledo, Ohio, January 31, 2005........today announced operating results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004.
Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE/HCN)
"We enhanced the foundation for the future growth of Health Care REIT during 2004," commented George L. Chapman, chief executive officer of Health Care REIT, Inc. "We incorporated a new contingency-based rental escalator in our lease structure, which provides for internal growth in FFO and FAD. We are pleased to have added $522 million of net new investments and six new operators. While we are disappointed that unanticipated G&A expenses and asset dispositions and transitions have caused us to miss our earnings estimate for 2004 and reduce our guidance for 2005, the company is positioned to generate strong recurring FAD per share growth in the range of 10-14% in 2005. As a result of this positive outlook, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the common stock dividend to $0.62 per quarter from $0.60 per quarter commencing with the May 2005 dividend."
As previously announced, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $0.60 per share as compared to $0.585 per share for the same period in 2003. The dividend represents the 135 consecutive dividend payment. The dividend will be payable February 22, 2005 to stockholders of record on January 31, 2005.

Summary of Fourth Quarter Results
(1) Excludes impairment charges in 2003.
(In thousands, except per share data)
Summary of Year to Date Results
(1) Excludes preferred stock redemption charge in 2003 and impairment charges in 2003 and 2004.
The company had a total outstanding debt balance of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2004, as compared with $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003, and stockholders' equity of $1.3 billion, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 47 percent. The debt to total market capitalization at December 31, 2004 was 34 percent. The company's coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest was 3.24 to 1.00 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. The company's coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.77 to 1.00 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the company transitioned a portfolio of 11 properties from an underperforming operator to three new operators. As a result of the transition, the company incurred a $3.8 million write-off relating to outstanding loans with the prior operator. In addition, during the third quarter of 2004, the company incurred an impairment charge of $314,000 on one property to reduce its book value to fair market value.
Impairments and Write-offs
.
The company recorded $1.7 million and $13.8 million of straight-line rent for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2004, respectively. Straight-line rent is net of $3.0 million and $8.1 million in cash payments outside the normal monthly rental payments for the three and twelve month periods, respectively.

During the fourth quarter, general and administrative expenses totaled $6.2 million, representing a $2.6 million increase compared to third quarter expenses. Of this $2.6 million sequential increase, approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, was not anticipated in the company's previous 2004 guidance. Approximately half of this $2.0 million is comprised of professional services fees, with additional taxes, compensation expenses and transition costs associated with the removal of an underperforming operator comprising the remainder. The company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will total approximately $17.5 to $18.5 million for the full-year 2005.
2004 Earnings Shortfall
.
The company is reducing its 2005 guidance and now expects to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.39 to $1.47 per diluted share and FFO in the range of $2.90 to $2.98 per diluted share. The guidance assumes net new investments of $200 million with leases that will not require rents to be straight-lined. The company expects to record straight-line rent of approximately $14 million for the full year 2005, before any payments outside the normal monthly rental payments. There are three primary factors that have contributed to the eight cent reduction in the company's forecast relative to its previous expectations.
Outlook for 2005
.
First, the company now anticipates dispositions of two high-yielding investments during early 2005 that were not in the previous guidance. These investments total approximately $50 million and generate a blended yield of 12.5%. Accordingly, the company has adjusted its net new investment guidance to $200 million, down from the previous estimate of $250 million. Based on an assumption that proceeds would be initially used to pay down a portion of the line of credit balance then later reinvested at an initial yield of 9.0-9.5%, this factor would represent an approximately $1.6 million, or $0.03 per share, reduction to the company's 2005 forecast.
Second, as a result of ongoing professional services fees, the company's current anticipated 2005 general and administrative expense of $17.5 to $18.5 million is approximately $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, higher than previously estimated.
Third, through a successful transition process to replace an underperforming operator during the fourth quarter of 2004, the company provided one of the three replacement operators with a rent deferral during the first six months of 2005. This will result in an incremental reduction to the company's 2005 forecast during the deferral period of approximately $1.65 million, or $0.03 per share.
Due to the increased focus on FAD, the company has now provided a reconciliation of FAD within this press release and forecasts 2005 FAD in a range of $2.65 to $2.73 per share based on estimated straight-line rent of $14 million in 2005. This $2.65 to $2.73 per share FAD guidance for 2005 represents strong 10-14% growth over 2004 recurring FAD of $2.40 per share, excluding the impact of any potential one-time cash payments the company may receive in 2005 and the actual $8.1 million in one-time cash payments received during calendar year 2004.
The company's guidance does not account for any impairments or unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve. Additionally, the company plans to manage itself to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with its current profile. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlooks for net income, FFO and FAD.
The Board of Directors approved a new quarterly dividend rate of $0.62 per share per quarter ($2.48 per share annually), commencing with the May 2005 dividend, up from $0.60, the rate during 2004. The company's dividend policy is reviewed annually during the Board of Director's January planning session. The declaration and payment of quarterly dividends remains subject to the review and approval of the Board of Directors.

The company believes that net income, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be a useful supplemental measure of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FAD represents FFO excluding the non-cash straight-line rental adjustments.
Supplemental Reporting Measures
.
In August 2003, the company adopted the SEC clarification of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic D-42. To implement the clarified accounting pronouncement, the company's 2003 results reflect a reduction in net income available to common stockholders resulting from a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2,790,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, due to the redemption of the company's 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in July 2003. NAREIT has issued its recommendation that preferred stock redemption charges should not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. Although the company has adopted this recommendation, it has also disclosed FFO and FAD adjusted for the preferred stock redemption charge for enhanced clarity. Additionally, the company believes that the nature of the charge is non-recurring because there was not a similar charge during the two preceding years and the company does not anticipate a similar charge in the succeeding two years.
In October 2003, NAREIT informed its member companies that the SEC had changed its position on certain aspects of the NAREIT FFO definition, including impairment charges. Previously, the SEC accepted NAREIT's view that impairment charges were effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an impending sale of property and thus should be excluded from FFO similar to other gains and losses on sales. However, the SEC's clarified interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. Although the company has adopted this recommendation, it has also disclosed FFO and FAD adjusted for the impairment charges for enhanced clarity.
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Additionally, the company excludes the non-cash provision for loan losses. The company believes that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of its operations. Additionally, restrictive covenants in the company's long-term debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. The company primarily utilizes EBITDA to measure its interest coverage ratio which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense.
FFO, FAD and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes. Additionally, FFO and FAD are internal evaluation metrics utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. FFO, FAD and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, FFO, FAD and EBITDA, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 13, 14, 15 and 16 for reconciliations of FAD, FFO and EBITDA to net income.
