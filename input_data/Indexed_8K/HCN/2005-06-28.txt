Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On June 22, 2005, Health Care REIT, Inc. (the "Company") and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a $500,000,000 unsecured line of credit arrangement with a consortium of ten banks, with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as syndication agent, and UBS Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as documentation agents. The agreement expires on June 22, 2008 but may be extended for an additional year, at the Company's option, upon payment of an extension fee. Borrowings under this line of credit are subject to interest payable in periods no longer than three months at either the administrative agent's prime rate of interest or the applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at the Company's option. The applicable margin is based on the Company's ratings with Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and is currently 0.900%. In addition, the Company annually pays a facility fee to each bank based on the bank's commitment under the line of credit. The facility fee depends upon the Company's ratings with Moody's and Standard & Poor's and is currently 0.225% of each bank's commitment. The Company also pays an annual agent's fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the agreement. The agreement includes customary representations and warranties by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and the borrowings under the agreement are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events of default.
     The Company also issued a press release announcing the new line of credit. The press release is posted on the Company's Web site (www.hcreit.com) under the heading Press Releases. A copy of the press release has been furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report.
     The foregoing description does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under this line of credit. The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement by and among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, the banks signatory thereto, KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as syndication agent, and UBS Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as documentation agents, dated as of June 22, 2005, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report.
     The new line of credit replaces the $310,000,000 unsecured line of credit arrangement with a consortium of eight banks, with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as syndication agent, and UBS Securities LLC, as documentation agent, that would have expired on May 15, 2006. Borrowings under the prior line of credit were subject to interest at either the agent bank's prime rate of interest or the applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate, at the Company's option. The applicable margin was 1.300% as of June 22, 2005. In addition, the Company annually paid a facility fee to each bank based on the bank's commitment under the line of credit. The facility fee was 0.325% of each bank's commitment as of June 22, 2005. The Company also paid an annual agent's fee of $50,000. The parties terminated the agreement on June 22, 2005.
     Commencing July 1, 2005, the Company intends to use a new form of restricted stock agreement in connection with grants of restricted stock to executive officers of the Company under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The form provides the basic terms relating to a grant of restricted stock, including the transfer restrictions, vesting period and effects of a change in corporate control of the Company, or the termination, death, disability or retirement of the executive officer. The stockholders of the Company approved the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 5, 2005. The plan authorizes the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, restricted stock, performance awards and other stock unit awards to any officer, key employee or non-employee director of the Company and replaces the Company's 1995 Stock Incentive Plan and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. A copy of the plan was attached as Appendix A to the Definitive Proxy Statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2005.
     The foregoing description does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the restricted stock agreement. The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form of Restricted Stock Agreement for Executive Officers under the Health Care REIT, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report.

Unless the Agent shall have been notified by a Bank or the Borrowers (the "PAYOR") prior to the date on which such Bank is to make payment to the Agent of the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it hereunder or the Borrowers are to make a payment to the Agent for the account of one or more of the Banks, as the case may be (such payment being herein called the "REQUIRED PAYMENT"), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not -19-
intend to make the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient on such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made the Required Payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand, repay to the Agent the amount made available to it together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal (i) when the recipient is a Bank, the Federal Funds Rate for such day, or (ii) the rate of interest applicable to such Loan (when the recipient is the Borrowers). SECTION 2.16 SHARING OF PAYMENTS AND SET-OFF AMONG BANKS. The Borrowers hereby agree that, in addition to (and without limitation of) any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim a Bank may otherwise have, each Bank shall be entitled, at its option, to offset balances held by it at any of its offices against any principal of or interest on any of its Loans hereunder or any Fee payable to it, that is not paid when due (regardless of whether such balances are then due to the Borrowers), in which case it shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Agent thereof, provided that its failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof. If a Bank shall effect payment of any principal of or interest or Fee on Loans held by it under this Agreement through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar right, it shall promptly purchase from the other Banks participations in the Loans held by the other Banks in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Banks shall share the benefit of such payment pro rata in accordance with the unpaid amount of principal and interest or Fee on the Loans held by each of them. To such end all the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. The Borrowers agree that any Bank so purchasing a participation in the Loans held by the other Banks may exercise all rights of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a direct holder of Loans in the amount of such participation. Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to exercise and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrowers. SECTION 2.17 CONVERSION OF LOANS. The Borrowers shall have the right to convert Loans of one Type into Loans of another Type from time to time, provided that: (i) the Borrowers shall give the Agent notice of each such conversion as provided in Section 2.2 hereof; (ii) LIBOR Loans may be converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans; and (iii) no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Loan continued as or converted into another LIBOR Loan if on the proposed date of conversion a Default or an Event of Default exists. The Agent shall use its best efforts to notify the Borrowers of the effectiveness of such conversion, and the new interest rate to which the converted Loans are subject, as soon as practicable after the conversion; provided, however, that any failure to give such notice shall not affect the Borrowers' obligations, or the Agent's or the Banks' rights and remedies, hereunder in any way whatsoever. -20-
SECTION 2.18 ADDITIONAL COSTS; CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. (a) In the event that any existing or future law or regulation, guideline or interpretation thereof, by any court or administrative or governmental authority (foreign or domestic) charged with the administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority shall impose, modify or deem applicable or result in the application of, any capital maintenance, capital ratio or similar requirement against loan commitments made by any Bank hereunder, and the result of any event referred to above is to impose upon any Bank or increase any capital requirement applicable as a result of the making or maintenance of such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment or the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder with respect to such Revolving Credit Commitment (which imposition of capital requirements may be determined by each Bank's reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such capital increases or impositions), then, within ten (10) Business Days' of demand made by such Bank as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge that such law, regulation, guideline, interpretation, request or directive exists and determines to make such demand, the Borrowers shall pay to such Bank from time to time as specified by such Bank additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate such Bank for such imposition of or increase in capital requirements together with interest on each such amount from the date demanded until payment in full thereof at the Post-Default Rate. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount necessary to compensate such Bank as a result of an imposition of or increase in capital requirements submitted by such Bank to the Borrowers shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, as to the amount thereof. All references to any "Bank" shall be deemed to include any participant in such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment. (b) In the event that any Regulatory Change shall: (i) change the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to any Bank under this Agreement or the Notes in respect of any Loans including, without limitation, LIBOR Loans (other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of such Bank for any such Loans by the United States of America or the jurisdiction in which such Bank has its principal office); or (ii) impose or modify any reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premium or assessment, special deposit or similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Bank (including any of such Loans or any deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Base Rate" in Article 1 hereof); or (iii) impose any other conditions affecting this Agreement in respect of Loans, including, without limitation, LIBOR Loans (or any of such extensions of credit, assets, deposits or liabilities); and the result of any event referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be to increase such Bank's costs of making or maintaining any Loans including, without limitation, LIBOR Loans, or its Revolving Credit Commitment, or to reduce any amount receivable by such Bank hereunder in respect of its Commitment (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable are hereinafter referred to as "ADDITIONAL COSTS") in each case, only to the extent, with respect to LIBOR Loans, that such Additional Costs are not included in the LIBOR Base Rate applicable to LIBOR Loans, then, within ten (10) Business Days' of demand made by such Bank as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge that such a Regulatory Change exists and determines to make such demand (a copy of which demand shall be delivered to the Agent), the Borrowers shall pay to such Bank from time to time as specified by such Bank, additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction in amounts receivable by such Bank from the date of such change, -21-
together with interest on each such amount from the date demanded until payment in full thereof at the Post-Default Rate. All references to any "Bank" shall be deemed to include any participant in such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment. (c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.18, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Bank either: (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which includes LIBOR Loans, or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Bank so elects by notice to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent), the obligation of such Bank to make, and to convert Loans of any other Type into, Loans of such Type hereunder shall be suspended until the date such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (and all Loans of such Type then outstanding shall be converted into Base Rate Loans or into LIBOR Loans of another duration as the case may be, in accordance with Sections 2.17 and 2.21). (d) Determinations by any Bank for purposes of this Section 2.18 of the effect of any Regulatory Change on its costs of making or maintaining Loans or on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the additional amounts required to compensate such Bank in respect of any Additional Costs, shall be set forth in writing in reasonable detail describing the Additional Costs together with a calculation demonstrating the allocation to the Borrowers of such Additional Costs which shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. SECTION 2.19 LIMITATION ON TYPES OF LOANS. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of an interest rate for any LIBOR Loans for any Interest Period therefor, the Required Banks determine (which determination shall be conclusive): (a) by reason of any event affecting the money markets in the United States of America or the London interbank market, quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining the rate of interest for such Loans under this Agreement; or (b) the rates of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Base Rate" in Article 1 hereof upon the basis of which the rate of interest on any LIBOR Loans for such period is determined, do not accurately reflect the cost to the Banks of making or maintaining such Loans for such period; then the Agent shall give the Borrowers and each Bank prompt notice thereof (and shall thereafter give the Borrowers and each Bank prompt notice of the cessation, if any, of such condition), and so long as such condition remains in effect, the Banks shall be under no obligation to make Loans of such Type or to convert Loans of any other Type into Loans of such Type and the Borrowers shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the -22-
outstanding Loans of the affected Type either repay such Loans in accordance with Section 2.5 hereof or convert such Loan into Loans of another Type in accordance with Section 2.17 hereof. SECTION 2.20 ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its applicable Lending Office to: (a) honor its obligation to make LIBOR Loans hereunder, or (b) maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, then such Bank shall promptly notify the Borrowers thereof (with a copy to the Agent), describing such illegality in reasonable detail (and shall thereafter promptly notify the Borrowers and the Agent of the cessation, if any, of such illegality), and such Bank's obligation to make LIBOR Loans and to convert Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans hereunder shall, upon written notice given by such Bank to the Borrowers, be suspended until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans and such Bank's outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be converted into Base Rate Loans, in accordance with Sections 2.17 and 2.21 hereof. SECTION 2.21 CERTAIN CONVERSIONS PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 2.18 AND 2.20. If the Loans of any Bank of a particular Type (Loans of such Type are hereinafter referred to as "AFFECTED LOANS" and such Type is hereinafter referred to as the "AFFECTED TYPE") are to be converted pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.20 hereof, such Bank's Affected Loans shall be converted into Base Rate Loans, or LIBOR Loans of another Type, as the case may be (the "NEW TYPE LOANS"), on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the Affected Loans (or, in the case of a conversion required by subsection 2.18(b) or Section 2.20 hereof, on such earlier date as such Bank may specify to the Borrowers with a copy to the Agent) and, until such Bank gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 2.18 or 2.20 hereof which gave rise to such conversion no longer exist: (a) to the extent that such Bank's Affected Loans have been so converted, all repayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its New Type Loans; (b) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as Loans of the Affected Type shall be made instead as New Type Loans and all Loans of such Bank which would otherwise be converted into Loans of the Affected Type shall be converted instead into (or shall remain as) New Type Loans. SECTION 2.22 INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Bank, upon the request of such Bank through the Agent, such amount or amounts as shall compensate such Bank for any loss (including loss of profit), cost or expense incurred by such Bank (as reasonably determined by such Bank) as a result of: (a) any payment or repayment or conversion of a LIBOR Loan held by such Bank on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan except pursuant to Sections 2.18 or 2.20 hereof; or -23-
(b) any failure by the Borrowers to borrow a LIBOR Loan held by such Bank on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant Borrowing Notice under Section 2.2 hereof, such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to: (i) any loss or expense suffered by such Bank during the period from the date of receipt of such early payment or repayment or the date of such conversion to the last day of such Interest Period if the rate of interest obtainable by such Bank upon the redeployment of an amount of funds equal to such Bank's pro rata share of such payment, repayment or conversion or failure to borrow or convert is less than the rate of interest applicable to such LIBOR Loan for such Interest Period, or (ii) any loss or expense suffered by such Bank in liquidating LIBOR deposits prior to maturity which correspond to such Bank's pro rata share of such payment, repayment, conversion, failure to borrow or failure to convert. The determination by each such Bank of the amount of any such loss or expense, when set forth in a written notice to the Borrowers, containing such Bank's calculation thereof in reasonable detail, shall be presumed correct, in the absence of manifest error. SECTION 2.23 EXTENSION OF REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE. Subject to the following provisions, the Borrowers shall have the option to extend the initial Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date to June 22, 2009. By written notice to the Agent delivered no later than six (6) months prior to the initial Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date, so long as no Event of Default has occurred since the date of this Agreement, the Borrowers may request such extension to the initial Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date (which request shall be accompanied by a Compliance Certificate). Promptly upon receipt of such written notice, the Agent shall deliver a copy to each Bank and the initial Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date shall be deemed so extended. In the event that the Borrowers shall have delivered an extension notice under this Section 2.23, the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Banks on the initial Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date, a non-refundable extension fee in an amount equal to twenty (20) basis points multiplied by the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, as then in effect. SECTION 2.24 INCREASE IN TOTAL REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENT. (a) The Borrowers may at their sole expense and effort and after consulting with the Agent, request: (i) one or more Banks acceptable to the Agent to increase (in the sole and absolute discretion of each such Bank) the amount of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments, and/or (ii) one or more other lending institutions acceptable to the Agent (each, a "NEW LENDER") to become "Banks" and extend Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder (each such existing Bank and each New Lender being referred to as a "PROPOSED LENDER"). To request an increase pursuant to this Section 2.24 (the "COMMITMENT INCREASE"), the Borrowers shall submit to the Agent a written increase request signed by the Borrowers and in form approved by the Agent (the "INCREASE REQUEST"), which shall specify, as the case may be: (A) each such existing Bank and the amount of the proposed increase to its Revolving Credit Commitment, or (B) the proposed Revolving Credit Commitment for each New Lender. -24-
Promptly following receipt of the Increase Request, the Agent shall advise each Proposed Lender of the details thereof. (b) If one or more Proposed Lender(s) shall have unconditionally agreed to such Increase Request in a writing delivered to the Borrowers and the Agent at any time prior to the 30th day following the date of the delivery to such Proposed Lenders(s) of the Increase Request (each such Proposed Lender being hereinafter referred to as an "INCREMENTAL LENDER"), then: (x) each such Incremental Lender which shall then be an existing Bank shall have its Revolving Credit Commitment increased by the amount set forth in the Increase Request, and (y) each such Incremental Lender which shall then be a New Lender shall be and become a "Bank" hereunder having a Revolving Credit Commitment equal to the amount set forth in such Increase Request, provided, however, that (1) immediately before and after giving effect thereto, no Default shall or would exist, (2) each such Incremental Lender shall have executed and delivered to the Agent a supplement to this Agreement providing for its increased Revolving Credit Commitment or its Revolving Credit Commitment, as applicable, in form approved by the Agent, (3) immediately after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment shall not exceed $550,000,000, (4) the increase of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment specified in the Increase Request shall be not less than $25,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof, (5) the minimum Revolving Credit Commitment extended by each Incremental Lender which is a New Lender shall be in a minimum amount of $15,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (6) the minimum increase to the Revolving Credit Commitment extended by each Incremental Lender which is an existing Bank shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (7) the Commitment Increase shall not be permitted hereunder unless consummated on or prior to the second anniversary of the date hereof. (c) Simultaneously with the Commitment Increase under this Section 2.24, each Incremental Lender shall, to the extent necessary, purchase from each other existing Bank, and each other existing Bank shall sell to each Incremental Lender, in each case at par and without representation, warranty, or recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.13), such principal amount of Loans of such other existing Bank(s), together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as will result, after giving effect to such transaction, in each Bank's pro rata share of Loans outstanding being equal to such Lender's pro rata share of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, provided that each such assignor Bank shall have received (to the extent of the interests, rights and obligations assigned) payment then due and owing of the outstanding principal amount of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees, commissions and all other amounts payable to it under the Loan Documents from the applicable assignee Banks (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest, fees and commissions) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts).

ARTICLE 9. THE AGENT. SECTION 9.1 APPOINTMENT, POWERS AND IMMUNITIES. Each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as its agent hereunder and the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall not be a trustee for any Bank. The Agent shall not be responsible to the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for the collectibility of the Loans or for any failure by any Borrower to perform any of its obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder -47-
or the other Loan Documents or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. SECTION 9.2 RELIANCE BY AGENT. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper person or persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or the other Loan Documents in accordance with instructions signed by the Required Banks, and such instructions of the Required Banks and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks. SECTION 9.3 EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default (other than the non-payment of principal of or interest on Loans) unless the Agent has received notice from a Bank or the Borrower specifying such Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks (and shall give each Bank notice of each such non-payment). The Agent shall (subject to Section 9.7 hereof) take such action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the Required Banks. SECTION 9.4 RIGHTS AS A BANK. With respect to its Revolving Credit Commitment and the Loans made by it, the Agent in its capacity as a Bank hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with each Borrower or its Affiliates, as if it were not acting as the Agent, and the Agent may accept fees and other consideration from each Borrower or its Affiliates, for services in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Banks. SECTION 9.5 INDEMNIFICATION. The Banks shall indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by each Borrower under Sections 10.1 and 10.2 hereof), ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the Loans made by the Banks (or, if no Loans are at the time outstanding, ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments), for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein -48-
or the transactions contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses that each Borrower is obligated to pay under Sections 10.1 and 10.2 hereof, but excluding normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified. SECTION 9.6 NON-RELIANCE ON AGENT AND OTHER BANKS. Each Bank agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of each Borrower and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. The Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by each Borrower of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of each Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder or the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of each Borrower, that may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its Affiliates. SECTION 9.7 FAILURE TO ACT. Except for action expressly required of the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or thereunder unless it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. SECTION 9.8 RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF AGENT. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, the Agent may resign at any time by giving not less than 10 days' prior written notice thereof to the Banks and each Borrower and the Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Banks. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Banks' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, after consultation with the Borrowers, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation or -49-
removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article 9 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent. SECTION 9.9 SHARING OF PAYMENTS. (a) Prior to any acceleration by the Agent and the Banks of the Obligations: (i) in the event that any Bank shall obtain payment in respect of a Note, or interest thereon, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, and whether through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim against each Borrower or otherwise, in a greater proportion than any such payment obtained by any other Bank in respect of the corresponding Note held by it, then the Bank so receiving such greater proportionate payment shall purchase for cash from the other Bank or Banks such portion of each such other Bank's or Banks' Loan as shall be necessary to cause such Bank receiving the proportionate overpayment to share the excess payment with each Bank; and (ii) in the event that any Bank shall obtain payment in respect of any Interest Rate Contract to which such Bank is a party, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, and whether through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim against each Borrower or otherwise, such Bank shall be permitted to retain the full amount of such payment and shall not be required to share such payment with any other Bank. (b) Upon or following any acceleration by the Agent and the Banks of the Obligations, in the event that any Bank shall obtain payment in respect of a Note, or interest or Fees thereon, or in respect of an Interest Rate Contract to which such Bank is a party, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, and whether through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim against each Borrower or otherwise, in a greater proportion than any such payment obtained by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of the corresponding Note held by such Bank and any Interest Rate Contract to which such Bank is a party, then the Bank so receiving such greater proportionate payment shall purchase for cash from the other Bank or Banks such portion of each such other Bank's or Banks' Loan as shall be necessary to cause such Bank receiving the proportionate overpayment to share the excess payment with each Bank. For the purposes of this subsection 9.9(b), payments on Notes received by each Bank shall be in the same proportion as the proportion of: (A) the sum of: (x) the Obligations owing to such Bank in respect of the Note held by such Bank, plus (y) the Obligations owing to such Bank in respect of Interest Rate Contracts to which such Bank is party, if any, to (B) the sum of: (x) the Obligations owing to all of the Banks in respect of all of the Notes, plus (y) the Obligations owing to all of the Banks in respect of all Interest Rate Contracts to which any Bank is a party; provided, however, that, with respect to subsections 9.9(a)(i) and (b) above, if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from the Bank that received the proportionate overpayment, such purchase of Loans or payment of benefits, as the case may be, shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. -50-
ARTICLE 10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. SECTION 10.1 FEES AND EXPENSES; INDEMNITY. (a) The Borrowers will promptly pay all costs of the Agent in preparing the Loan Documents and all costs and expenses of the issue of the Notes and of each Borrower's performance of and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with and the reasonable fees and expenses and disbursements of counsel to the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery, administration, interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and all other agreements, instruments and documents relating to this transaction, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by all such documents, the preservation of all rights of the Banks and the Agent, the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of any amendment, modification or supplement of or to, or any consent or waiver under, any such document (or any such instrument that is proposed but not executed and delivered) and with any claim or action threatened, made or brought against any of the Banks or the Agent arising out of or relating to any extent to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (other than a claim or action resulting from the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or intentional violation of law by the Agent and or the Banks). (b) In addition, the Borrowers will promptly pay all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) suffered or incurred by each Bank in connection with its enforcement of the payment of the Notes held by it or any other sum due to it under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any of its other rights hereunder or thereunder. In addition to the foregoing, the Borrowers shall indemnify each Bank and the Agent and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents and Affiliates against, and hold each of them harmless from, any loss, liabilities, damages, claims, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) suffered or incurred by any of them arising out of, resulting from or in any manner connected with, the execution, delivery and performance of each of the Loan Documents, the Loans and any and all transactions related to or consummated in connection with the Loans (other than as a result of the gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional violation of law by the party seeking indemnification), including, without limitation, losses, liabilities, damages, claims, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by any Bank or the Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents or Affiliates arising out of or related to any Environmental Liability or Environmental Proceeding, or in investigating, preparing for, defending against, or providing evidence, producing documents or taking any other action in respect of any commenced or threatened litigation, administrative proceeding or investigation under any federal securities law or any other statute of any jurisdiction, or any regulation, or at common law or otherwise against the Agent, the Banks or any of their officers, directors, affiliates, agents or Affiliates, that is alleged to arise out of or is based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact of any Borrower and its affiliates in any document or schedule filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental body; (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state any material fact required to be stated in such document or schedule, or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which made, not misleading; (iii) any acts, practices or omission or alleged acts, practices or omissions of any Borrower or its agents related to the -51-
making of any acquisition, purchase of shares or assets pursuant thereto, financing of such purchases or the consummation of any other transactions contemplated by any such acquisitions that are alleged to be in violation of any federal securities law or of any other statute, regulation or other law of any jurisdiction applicable to the making of any such acquisition, the purchase of shares or assets pursuant thereto, the financing of such purchases or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by any such acquisition; or (iv) any withdrawals, termination or cancellation of any such proposed acquisition for any reason whatsoever.

If, under any law in effect on the date of the closing of any Loan hereunder, or under any retroactive provision of any law subsequently enacted, it shall be determined that any Federal, state or local tax is payable in respect of the issuance of any Note, or in connection with the filing or recording of any assignments, mortgages, financing statements, or other documents (whether measured by the amount of Indebtedness secured or otherwise) as contemplated by this Agreement, then each Borrower will pay any such tax and all interest and penalties, if any, and will indemnify the Banks and the Agent against and save each of them harmless from any loss or damage resulting from or arising out of the nonpayment or delay in payment of any such tax. If any such tax or taxes shall be assessed or levied against any Bank or any other holder of a Note, such Bank, or such other holder, as the case may be, may notify each Borrower and make immediate payment thereof, together with interest or penalties in connection therewith, and shall thereupon be entitled to and shall receive immediate reimbursement therefor from each Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the covenants and agreements of the Borrowers in this Section 10.2 shall survive payment of the Notes and the termination of this Agreement. SECTION 10.3 PAYMENTS. As set forth in Article 2 hereof, all payments by each Borrower on account of principal, interest, fees and other charges (including any indemnities) shall be made to the Agent at the Principal Office of the Agent, in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available funds, by wire transfer or otherwise, not later than 11:00 A.M. Cleveland, Ohio time on the date such payment is due. Any such payment made on such date but after such time shall, if the amount paid bears interest, be deemed to have been made on, and interest shall continue to accrue and be payable thereon until, the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment of principal or interest becomes due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment. All payments hereunder and under the Notes shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and in such amounts as may be necessary in order that all such payments shall not be less than the amounts otherwise specified to be paid under this Agreement and the Notes (after withholding for or on account of: (i) any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties or other similar charges of whatever nature imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof, other than any tax (except those referred to in clause (ii) below) on or measured by the net income of the Bank to which any -52-

All uses herein of the masculine gender or of singular or plural terms shall be deemed to include uses of the feminine or neuter gender, or plural or singular terms, as the context may require. SECTION 10.5 LIEN ON AND SET-OFF OF DEPOSITS. As security for the due payment and performance of all the Obligations, each Borrower hereby grants to Agent for the ratable benefit of the Banks a Lien on any and all deposits or other sums at any time credited by or due from the Agent or any Bank to the Borrower, whether in regular or special depository accounts or otherwise, and any and all monies, securities and other property of the Borrower, and the proceeds thereof, now or hereafter held or received by or in transit to any Bank or the Agent from or for such Borrower, whether for safekeeping, custody, pledge, transmission, collection or otherwise, and any such deposits, sums, monies, securities and other property, may at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default be set-off, appropriated and applied by any Bank or the Agent against any of the Obligations, whether or not any of such Obligations is then due or is secured by any collateral. SECTION 10.6 MODIFICATIONS, CONSENTS AND WAIVERS; ENTIRE AGREEMENT. No modification, amendment or waiver of or with respect to any provision of this Agreement, any Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents and all other agreements, instruments and documents delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, nor consent to any departure by any Borrower from any of the terms or conditions thereof, shall in any event be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by the Agent and each Bank except that: (i) any modification or amendment of, or waiver or consent with respect to, Article 4 shall be required to be signed only by the Agent and the Required Banks, and (ii) any modification or amendment of, or waiver or consent with respect to, Articles 1 (other than the definition of "Required Banks" or any other defined term which is used in the application of any of the provisions of Article 2), 5, 6, 7, 8 (other than Section 8.1 and Section 8.4 hereof) and 10 (other than this Section 10.6) may be signed only by the Agent and the Required Banks. Any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No consent to or demand on any Borrower in any case shall, of itself, entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding among the Banks, the Agent and the Borrowers and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. -53-
SECTION 10.7 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; COUNTERCLAIMS. Each and every right granted to the Agent and the Banks hereunder or under any other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, or allowed it by law or equity, shall be cumulative and may be exercised from time to time. No failure on the part of the Agent or any Bank or the holder of any Note to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The due payment and performance of the Obligations shall be without regard to any counterclaim, right of offset or any other claim whatsoever that any Borrower may have against any Bank or the Agent and without regard to any other obligation of any nature whatsoever that any Bank or the Agent may have to any Borrower, and no such counterclaim or offset shall be asserted by any Borrower (unless such counter-claim or offset would, under applicable law, be permanently and irrevocably lost if not brought in such action) in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by any Bank or the Agent for payment or performance of the Obligations. SECTION 10.8 FURTHER ASSURANCES. At any time and from time to time, upon the request of the Agent, each Borrower shall execute, deliver and acknowledge or cause to be executed, delivered and acknowledged, such further documents and instruments and do such other acts and things as the Agent may reasonably request in order to fully effect the purposes of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any other agreements, instruments and documents delivered pursuant hereto or in connection with the Loans.

SECTION 10.11 SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any clause or provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability shall affect only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction and shall not in any manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or any other clause or provision in this Agreement in any jurisdiction. Each of the covenants, agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement is independent and compliance by the Borrower with any of them shall not excuse non-compliance by the Borrower with any other. All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists. SECTION 10.12 BINDING EFFECT; NO ASSIGNMENT OR DELEGATION BY BORROWERS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the Borrowers and their respective successors and to the benefit of the Banks and the Agent and their respective successors and assigns.

(a) Each Bank may assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, the Loans owing to it, and the Note held by it); provided, however, that: (i) the Borrowers and the Agent must give prior written consent to such assignment (unless such assignment is to an Affiliate of such Bank or to another Bank), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, and a processing fee of $3,500.00, (iii) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv) the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of the assigning Bank being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and (v) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee. Upon such execution, delivery and acceptance, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective date shall be at least five (5) Business Days after the execution thereof: (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights -56-
and obligations of a Bank hereunder, and (y) the Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clause (a)(i) above, no consent of the Borrowers shall be required for an assignment if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Bank assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Bank makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Bank makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of each Borrower or the performance or observance by each Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of such financial statements and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Bank or any other Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank. (c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Bank and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with any Note subject to such assignment, the Agent shall: (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, and (ii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers. Within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrowers, at their own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note a new Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Bank has retained a Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Bank in an amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Note shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto. -57-
(d) Each Bank may, without the prior consent of the Agent, the other Banks or the Borrowers, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, the Loans owing to it, and the Note held by it); provided, however, that: (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, and the Borrowers, the Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. (e) Any Bank may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 10.13, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to any Borrower furnished to such Bank by or on behalf of such Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to such Borrower received by it from such Bank. (f) Anything in this Section 10.13 to the contrary notwithstanding, any Bank may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Note to any Federal Reserve Bank (and its transferees) as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder. SECTION 10.14 DELIVERY OF TAX FORMS. Each Bank that is not organized under the laws of the United States or a state thereof shall: (a) deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent, on or prior to the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the date on which it becomes a Bank hereunder, two accurate and duly completed executed copies of United States IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or successor applicable form, as the case may be; (b) deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent two further accurate and complete executed copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrowers; and (c) obtain such extensions of time for filing and completing such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Borrowers or the Agent; unless in any such case under clause (b) above an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such -58-
delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank so advises the Borrower and the Agent. Such Bank shall certify with respect to Form W-8BEN or W8ECI, as appropriate that (i) it is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States Federal income taxes; (ii) to the extent legally entitled to do so, that it is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without, or at a reduced rate of, deduction or withholding of any United States Federal income taxes; or (iii) that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each Person not organized under the laws of the United States or a state thereof that is an assignee hereunder shall, prior to the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms and statements required pursuant to this Section 10.14. SECTION 10.15 GOVERNING LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. (a) THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ALL OTHER DOCUMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED AND DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH AND THEREWITH, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES PERTAINING TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS. (b) EACH BORROWER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS THAT ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST IT UNDER, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY MANNER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK, OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. EACH BORROWER, BY THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY ASSENTS AND SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF ANY OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

EACH BORROWER HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY CLAIM OR DEFENSE IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BASED ON ANY ALLEGED LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION, IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM NON CONVENIENS OR ANY SIMILAR BASIS. EACH BORROWER SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ASSERT ANY DEFENSE GIVEN OR ALLOWED UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK UNLESS SUCH DEFENSE IS ALSO GIVEN OR ALLOWED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 10.15 SHALL AFFECT OR IMPAIR IN ANY MANNER OR TO ANY EXTENT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY BANK TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST ANY -59-
BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION OR THE RIGHT, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER, TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. (c) EACH BORROWER, THE BANKS AND THE AGENT WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION IN ANY COURT WITH RESPECT TO, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. SECTION 10.16 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Agent and the Banks agree to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory or self-regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) with the consent of the Borrowers, or (g) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section, or (ii) becomes available to the Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrowers. For the purposes of this Section, "INFORMATION" means all information received from Borrower relating to Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower; provided, that, in the case of information received from Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. SECTION 10.17 USA PATRIOT ACT NOTICE. The Agent and each Bank hereby notifies each Borrower that, pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "PATRIOT ACT"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow the Agent and such Banks to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the Patriot Act. -60-

All indebtedness outstanding under this Note shall bear interest (computed in the same manner as interest on this Note prior to the relevant due date) at the applicable Post-Default Rate for all periods when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, commencing on the occurrence of such Event of Default until such Event of Default has been cured or waived as acknowledged in writing by the Agent, and all of such interest shall be payable on demand. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligation of the Borrowers to make payments of interest shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required to be made to the Bank to the extent that the Bank's receipt thereof would not be permissible under the law or laws applicable to the Bank limiting rates of interest which may be charged or collected by the Bank. Any such payments of interest which are not made as a result of the limitation referred to in the preceding sentence shall be made by the Borrowers to the Bank on the earliest interest payment date or dates on which the receipt thereof would be permissible under the laws applicable to the Bank limiting rates of interest which may be charged or collected by the Bank.

The Bank is hereby authorized by the Borrowers to record on the schedule to this Note (or on a supplemental schedule thereto) the amount of each Loan made by the Bank to the Borrowers and the amount of each payment or repayment of principal of such Loans received by the Bank, it being understood, however, that failure to make any such notation shall not affect the rights of the Bank or the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder in respect of this Note. The Bank may, at its option, record such matters in its internal records rather than on such schedule. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the principal amount and accrued interest on this Note may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Agreement. The Borrowers shall pay costs and expenses of collection, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements in the event that any action, suit or proceeding is brought by the holder hereof to collect this Note.

EXHIBIT 10.2 RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), made this ____ day of ____________, 20__, between Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), and _________________________ (the "Participant"). WITNESSETH: WHEREAS, the Participant is an employee and executive officer of the Corporation; and WHEREAS, the Corporation adopted the Health Care REIT, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") in order to provide non-employee directors and select officers and key employees with incentives to achieve long-term corporate objectives; and WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee of the Corporation's Board of Directors has decided that the Participant should be granted restricted shares of the Corporation's common stock, $1.00 par value per share ("Common Stock"), on the terms and conditions set forth below in accordance with the terms of the Plan. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the past and future services provided to the Corporation by the Participant and the various covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. Grant of Restricted Stock. The Corporation hereby grants to the Participant a total of __________ (_____) shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation (the "Restricted Shares"), subject to the transfer restrictions, vesting schedule and other conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Participant shall not be required to provide the Corporation with any payment (other than his or her past and future services to the Corporation) in exchange for such Restricted Shares. As provided in Section 4, the Corporation shall cause the Restricted Shares to be issued and a stock certificate or certificates representing the Restricted Shares to be registered in the name of the Participant promptly upon execution of this Agreement. On or before the date of execution of this Agreement, the Participant shall deliver to the Corporation one or more stock powers endorsed in blank relating to the Restricted Shares. 2. Restrictions. (a) The Participant shall have all rights and privileges of a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to the Restricted Shares, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends paid with respect to the Restricted Shares, except that the following restrictions shall apply until such time or times as these restrictions lapse under Section 3 or any other provision of this Agreement:
(i) the Participant shall not be entitled to delivery of the certificate or certificates for any of the Restricted Shares until the restrictions imposed by this Agreement have lapsed with respect to those Restricted Shares; (ii) the Restricted Shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the Participant before these restrictions have lapsed, except with the consent of the Corporation; and (iii) the Restricted Shares shall be subject to forfeiture upon termination of the Participant's employment with the Corporation to the extent set forth in Section 6 below. If any portion of the Restricted Shares become vested under Section 3 below (or Sections 6, 7 or 8), such newly vested shares shall no longer be subject to the preceding restrictions and shall no longer be considered Restricted Shares. (b) Any attempt to dispose of Restricted Shares in a manner contrary to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement shall be ineffective. 3. Vesting; When Restrictions Lapse. The Restricted Shares shall vest in five annual installments, on _________, 20__ and the next four anniversaries of such date, or at such earlier time as the restrictions may lapse pursuant to Sections 6, 7 or 8 of this Agreement. In the absence of any accelerated vesting and lapse of the restrictions under Sections 6, 7 or 8, the restrictions set forth in this Agreement shall lapse with respect to the following numbers of shares on the following dates: 4. Issuance of Stock Certificates for Shares. The stock certificate or certificates representing the Restricted Shares shall be issued promptly following the execution of this Agreement, and shall be delivered to the Corporate Secretary or such other custodian as may be designated by the Corporation, to be held until the restrictions lapse under Sections 3, 6, 7 or 8. Such stock certificate or certificates shall bear the following legend: 2
"The transferability of the shares of stock represented by this Certificate are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture) of a Restricted Stock Agreement entered into between the registered owner and Health Care REIT, Inc. A copy of such Restricted Stock Agreement is on file in the offices of the Corporate Secretary, Health Care REIT, Inc., One SeaGate, Suite 1500, Toledo, Ohio 43604." Once the restrictions imposed by this Agreement have lapsed with respect to any portion of the Restricted Shares, a stock certificate or certificates for such portion of the Restricted Shares shall be returned and exchanged for a new unlegended stock certificate representing the newly vested shares. The new certificates shall be delivered to the Participant (or to the person to whom the rights of the Participant shall have passed by will or the laws of descent and distribution) promptly after the date on which the restrictions imposed on such shares by this Agreement have lapsed, but not before the Participant has made arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation for tax withholding (as required by Section 5), and provided that any certificate representing the portion of the newly vested shares (if any) that the Participant applies to satisfy his or her tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 5(b) below shall be delivered to the Corporation rather than the Participant. 5. Tax Withholding. Whenever the restrictions applicable to all or a portion of the Restricted Shares lapse under the terms of this Agreement, the Corporation shall notify the Participant of the amount of tax that must be withheld by the Corporation under all applicable federal, state and local tax laws. The Participant agrees to make arrangements with the Corporation to (a) remit the required amount to the Corporation in cash, (b) deliver to the Corporation shares of Common Stock currently held by the Participant (including newly vested Restricted Shares) with a value equal to the required amount, (c) authorize the deduction of the required amount from the Participant's compensation, or (d) otherwise provide for payment of the required amount in a manner satisfactory to the Corporation. 6. Termination of Employment; Change in Corporate Control. If the Participant's employment with the Corporation is involuntarily terminated for "Cause" (as defined in the Participant's Employment Agreement) during the term of this Agreement, or if the Participant voluntarily terminates his or her employment with the Corporation (other than after a Change in Corporate Control (as described below) or as provided in Sections 7 or 8 below), including any termination after the term of the Participant's Employment Agreement expires by reason of the Participant's election not to extend the term of the Employment Agreement, any Restricted Shares that remain subject to the restrictions imposed by this Agreement shall be forfeited. If the Participant's employment is terminated involuntarily without Cause, including an involuntary termination without Cause as a result of the Corporation's election not to extend the term of the Participant's Employment Agreement, or in the event of a Change in 3
Corporate Control, vesting shall be accelerated, the restrictions imposed by this Agreement on the remaining Restricted Shares shall lapse immediately, and no Restricted Shares shall be forfeited. For purposes of this Section 6, a "Change in Corporate Control" shall include any of the following events: (a) The acquisition in one or more transactions of more than twenty percent of the Corporation's outstanding Common Stock (or the equivalent in voting power of any class or classes of securities of the Corporation entitled to vote in elections of directors) by any corporation, or other person or group (within the meaning of Section 14(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended); (b) Any transfer or sale of substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or any merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another corporation in which the Corporation is not the surviving entity; (c) Any election of persons to the Board of Directors which causes a majority of the Board of Directors to consist of persons other than "Continuing Directors." For this purpose, those persons who were members of the Board of Directors on May 5, 2005, shall be "Continuing Directors." Any person who is nominated for election as a member of the Board after May 5, 2005 shall also be considered a "Continuing Director" for this purpose if, and only if, his or her nomination for election to the Board of Directors is approved or recommended by a majority of the members of the Board (or of the relevant Nominating Committee) and at least five (5) members of the Board are themselves Continuing Directors at the time of such nomination; or (d) Any person, or group of persons, announces a tender offer for at least twenty percent (20%) of the Corporation's Common Stock. 7. Effect of Death. If the termination of the Participant's employment occurs as a result of the Participant's death, vesting shall be accelerated and all of the restrictions imposed on the Restricted Shares by this Agreement shall lapse immediately. 8. Effect of Permanent and Total Disability. If the termination of the Participant's employment occurs after a finding of the Participant's permanent and total disability, vesting shall be accelerated and all of the restrictions imposed on the Restricted Shares by this Agreement shall lapse immediately. 9. Effect of Retirement. If the termination of the Participant's employment occurs as a result of the Participant's retirement after age 55 and the sum of the Participant's age and years of service to 4
the Corporation is equal to 65 or more, vesting shall be accelerated and all of the restrictions imposed on the Restricted Shares by this Agreement shall lapse immediately. 10. Securities Laws. The Corporation may from time to time impose such conditions on the transfer of the Restricted Shares as it deems necessary or advisable to ensure that any transfers of the Restricted Shares will satisfy the applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws. Such conditions may include, without limitation, the partial or complete suspension of the right to transfer the Restricted Shares until the Restricted Shares have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 11. Grant Not to Affect Employment. Neither this Agreement nor the Restricted Shares granted hereunder shall confer upon the Participant any right to continued employment with the Corporation. This Agreement shall not in any way modify or restrict any rights the Corporation may have to terminate such employment under the terms of the Participant's Employment Agreement with the Corporation. 12. Miscellaneous. (a) This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which taken together will constitute one and the same instrument. (b) The terms of this Agreement may only be amended, modified or waived by a written agreement executed by both of the parties hereto. (c) The validity, performance, construction and effect of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law; provided, however, that matters of corporate law, including the issuance of shares of Common Stock, shall be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on the date and year first above written. ATTEST: HEALTH CARE REIT, INC.
