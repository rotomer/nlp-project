Summary of Year to Date Results
 
The company had a total outstanding debt balance of $1.4 billion at June 30, 2005, as compared with $1.0 billion at June 30, 2004, and stockholders' equity of $1.3 billion. At June 30, 2005, the company's debt to total book capitalization ratio was 51% and the debt to total market capitalization ratio was 37%. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the company's coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest was 3.26 to 1.00 and the coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.57 to 1.00, after adjusting for the one-time debt extinguishment charge of $18.4 million in the second quarter.
The company recorded $1.2 million and $4.0 million of straight-line rent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005. Straight-line rent is net of $2.4 million and $3.2 million in cash payments outside normal monthly rental payments for the three and six month periods, respectively.
Straight-line Rent
.
As previously announced, the company revised its 2005 net investment guidance to a range of $100 to $200 million from the previous guidance of $200 million. The revision in net investment guidance is due to an increase in anticipated dispositions pursuant to our active asset management program to a range of approximately $50 to $200 million during the remainder of the year. The new investments will primarily comprise leases that will not require rents to be straight-lined. Due to the one-time debt extinguishment charge, the company now expects to report net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.05 to $1.13 per diluted share. Excluding the loss on extinguishment of debt, the company is reaffirming its guidance for 2005 FFO in the range of $2.90 to $2.98 per diluted share. The company now expects to record straight-line rent of approximately $10 million for the full year 2005, before any additional cash payments outside normal monthly rental payments, and is increasing its 2005 FAD guidance to a range of $2.72 to $2.80 from $2.66 to $2.74 per diluted share. The company continues to anticipate that general and administrative expenses will total between $17.5 million and $18.5 million for the full year 2005.
Outlook for 2005
.
The company's guidance does not account for any impairments or unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve. Additionally, the company plans to manage itself to maintain investment grade status with a capital

structure consistent with its current profile. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income to FFO and FAD.
The company believes that net income, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FAD represents FFO excluding the non-cash straight-line rental adjustments.
Supplemental Reporting Measures.
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Additionally, the company excludes the non-cash provision for loan losses. The company believes that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of its operations. Additionally, restrictive covenants in the company's long-term debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. The company primarily utilizes EBITDA to measure its interest coverage ratio which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense.
In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 145 that requires gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under Statement No. 4. The company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2003 and has properly reflected the current quarter loss on extinguishment of debt which may not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. Although the company has adopted this treatment, it has also disclosed FFO, FAD and EBITDA adjusted for the loss on extinguishment of debt for enhanced clarity.
FFO, FAD and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes. Additionally, FFO and FAD are internal evaluation metrics utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. FFO, FAD and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, FFO, FAD and EBITDA, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 13, 14 and 16 for reconciliations of FAD, FFO and EBITDA to net income.
The company has scheduled a conference call on July 20, 2005, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss its second quarter results, industry trends, portfolio performance and outlook for 2005.
