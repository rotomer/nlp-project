UBS Securities LLC 299 Park Avenue New York, New York 10171
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to sell to UBS Securities LLC (the "Underwriter"), an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares (the "Firm Shares") of the Company's Common Stock, $1.00 par value per share ("Common Stock"). The Company also proposes to sell at the Underwriter's option an aggregate of up to 450,000 additional shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Option Shares") as set forth below.
     As the Underwriter, you have advised the Company (a) that you are authorized to enter into this Agreement and (b) that you are willing to purchase the Firm Shares, plus such Option Shares if you elect to exercise the over-allotment option in whole or in part for your account. The Firm Shares and the Option Shares (to the extent such option is exercised) are herein collectively called the "Shares."
     In consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein and of the interests of the parties in the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
     The Company represents and warrants as follows:
1. Representations and Warranties of the Company.
     (i) A registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-120917) with respect to the Shares has been carefully prepared by the Company in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") thereunder and has been filed with the Commission under the Securities Act. The Company has complied with the conditions for the use of Form S-3. Copies of such registration statement, including any amendments thereto, the preliminary prospectuses (meeting the requirements of Rule 430A of the Rules and Regulations) contained therein, the exhibits, financial statements and schedules, as finally amended and revised, and all documents incorporated by reference have heretofore been delivered by the Company to you. Such registration statement, herein referred to as the "Registration Statement," which shall be deemed to include all information omitted therefrom in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in the Prospectus referred to below and all information incorporated by reference therein, has been declared effective by the Commission
 
under the Securities Act and no post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed as of the date of this Agreement; and the Registration Statement and Prospectus as referred to below comply, or will comply, as the case may be, in all material respects with the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations. The form of prospectus first filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to its Rule 424(b) and Rule 430A, or if no such filing is required, the form of final prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective, is herein referred to as the "Prospectus." Each preliminary prospectus included in the Registration Statement prior to the time it becomes effective is herein referred to as a "Preliminary Prospectus." Any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein and any supplements or amendments thereto filed with the Commission as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, and in the case of any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, also shall be deemed to include any documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, and any supplements or amendments thereto, filed with the Commission after the date of the filing of the Prospectus under Rule 424(b) or 430A, and prior to the termination of the offering of the Shares by the Underwriter. Any reference to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference into such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. Any reference to the Prospectus herein shall be deemed to include the most recent prospectus supplement filed with respect to the Shares and shall also be deemed to include any documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act.
     (ii) The Company has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement; the Company is duly qualified to transact business in all jurisdictions in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, and in which the failure to qualify would (a) have a materially adverse effect upon the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined below), taken as a whole, (b) adversely affect the issuance, validity, or enforceability of the Shares or (c) adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each of (a), (b) and (c) above, a "Material Adverse Effect"). All of the Company's subsidiaries are listed in Schedule I hereto (the "Subsidiaries").
     (iii) The capitalization of the Company contained in the section of the Prospectus entitled "Capitalization" sets forth the authorized, issued and outstanding capitalization of the Company at the indicated date; all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; the shares of Common Stock of the Company are duly listed on the New York Stock Exchange; the Shares to be issued and sold by the Company have been duly authorized and when issued and paid for as contemplated herein will be validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable; and no preemptive or similar rights of stockholders exist with respect to any of the Shares or the issue and sale thereof.
 
     (iv) The shares of authorized capital stock of the Company, including the Shares, conform with the statements concerning them in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
     (v) The Commission has not issued an order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus relating to the proposed offering of the Shares nor instituted proceedings for that purpose. As of the date it became effective, the Registration Statement contained, and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto will contain, as of the time of this Agreement and as of the date the Prospectus, such amendment or supplement is filed with the Commission, all statements which are required to be stated therein by, and in all material respects conform to or will conform to, as the case may be, the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations of the Commission thereunder. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the time they were or will be filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed or will conform at the time of filing, in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as applicable, and the Rules and Regulations of the Commission thereunder. The Registration Statement did not, as of the date it became effective, contain, and does not as of the time of this Agreement contain, and any amendment thereto, including any documents incorporated by reference therein, will not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit and will not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, as of the time of this Agreement and as of the date of the Prospectus, the date such amendment or supplement is filed with the Commission and the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, including any documents incorporated by reference therein, do not contain and will not contain, as the case may be, any untrue statement of a material fact and do not omit and will not omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, or any documents incorporated by reference therein, in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriter, specifically for use in the preparation thereof.
     (vi) The financial statements of the Company, together with related notes and schedules as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, present fairly the financial position and the results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the indicated dates and for the indicated periods. Such financial statements and the related notes and schedules have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied throughout the periods involved, and all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results for such periods have been made. The summary financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement present fairly the information shown therein and, to the extent based upon or derived from the financial statements, have been compiled on a basis consistent with the financial statements presented therein. All disclosures contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, regarding "non-GAAP financial measures" (as such term is defined by the Rules and Regulations) comply with Regulation G of the Exchange Act and Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, to the extent applicable.
     (vii) There is no action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened (a) against the Company or its Subsidiaries or (b) involving any property of the Company or its Subsidiaries before any court or administrative agency which, if determined adversely, might reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in the Registration Statement.
 
     (viii) The Company, together with its Subsidiaries, has good and marketable title to all of the properties and assets reflected in the financial statements hereinabove described (or as described in the Registration Statement as owned by it), subject to no lien, mortgage, pledge, charge or encumbrance of any kind except those reflected in such financial statements (or as described in the Registration Statement) or which are not material in amount or which do not interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of the property. The leases, agreements to purchase and mortgages to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the guaranties of third parties (a) are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, of all other parties thereto, and the Company knows of no default or defenses currently existing with respect thereto which might reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect, and (b) conform to the descriptions thereof set forth in the Registration Statement. Each mortgage which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds on the properties described in the Registration Statement constitutes a valid mortgage lien for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, on such property.
     (ix) The Company has filed all Federal, state and foreign income tax returns which have been required to be filed and has paid all taxes indicated by said returns and all assessments received by it to the extent that such taxes have become due and are not being contested in good faith. All tax liabilities have been adequately provided for in the financial statements of the Company.
     (x) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, as it may be amended or supplemented, there has not been any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company or the earnings, capital stock (except that Common Stock has increased due to option exercises, the Company's dividend reinvestment program and conversions of preferred stock), business affairs, management, or business prospects of the Company, whether or not occurring in the ordinary course of business, and the Company has not incurred any material liabilities or obligations and there has not been any material transaction entered into by the Company, other than transactions in the ordinary course of business and changes and transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement, as it may be amended or supplemented. The Company has no material contingent obligations which are not disclosed in the Registration Statement, as it may be amended or supplemented.
     (xi) The Company is not in violation of its charter or by-laws. No Subsidiary is in violation of its charter or by-laws, which violation will have, or after any required notice and passage of any applicable grace period would have, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are (a) in default under any agreement, lease, contract, indenture or other instrument or obligation to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties is bound, (b) in violation of any statute, or (c) in violation of any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its properties, of any court or of any regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body, any of which defaults or violations described in clauses (a) through (c) will have, or after any required notice and passage of any applicable grace period would have, a Material Adverse Effect. The issue and sale of the Shares and the performance by the Company of all of its obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated and the fulfillment of the terms hereof will not conflict with or constitute a violation of any statute or conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other agreement or instrument to which the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, or a violation of its charter or by-laws
 
or any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its properties of any court or of any regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body.
     (xii) Each approval, consent, order, authorization, designation, declaration or filing by or with any regulatory, administrative or other governmental body necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated (except for the filing of a prospectus supplement relating to the Shares or such additional steps as may be required by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") or may be necessary to qualify the Shares for public offering by the Underwriter under state securities or Blue Sky laws) has been obtained or made by the Company, and is in full force and effect.
     (xiii) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates and permits from governmental authorities which are necessary to the conduct of their businesses and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have received any notice of infringement or of conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any patents, patent rights, trade names, trademarks or copyrights, which infringement is material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
     (xiv) The Company qualifies as a real estate investment trust pursuant to Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, has so qualified for the taxable years ended December 31, 1984 through December 31, 2004 and no transaction or other event has occurred or is contemplated which would prevent the Company from so qualifying for its current taxable year.
     (xv) To the best of the Company's knowledge, Ernst & Young LLP, who have certified certain of the financial statements and related schedules filed with the Commission as part of, or incorporated by reference in, the Registration Statement, is an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company as required by the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB").
     (xvi) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets; (c) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
     (xvii) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to perform the functions for which they were established; the Company's auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company have been advised of: (a) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data; and (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a role in the Company's internal controls; any material weaknesses in internal controls have been
 
identified for the Company's auditors; and since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
     (xviii) Since July 30, 2002, the Company has not, directly or indirectly, including through any subsidiary: (a) extended credit, arranged to extend credit, or renewed any extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan, to or for any director or executive officer of the Company, or to or for any family member or affiliate of any director or executive officer of the Company; or (b) made any material modification, including any renewal thereof, to any term of any personal loan to any director or executive officer of the Company, or any family member or affiliate of any director or executive officer, which loan was outstanding on July 30, 2002.
     (xix) To the knowledge of the Company, after inquiry of its officers and directors, there are no affiliations with any NASD member firm among the Company's officers, directors, or principal stockholders, except as set forth in the Registration Statement or as otherwise disclosed in writing to the Underwriter.
     (xx) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     (xxi) Neither the Company nor any of its officers or directors has taken nor will any of them take, directly or indirectly, any action resulting in a violation of Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act, or designed to cause or result in, or which has constituted or which reasonably might be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Company's Common Stock. The Company acknowledges that the Underwriter may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Common Stock, including stabilizing bids, syndicate covering transactions and the imposition of penalty bids.
     (xxii) The Shares have been approved for listing upon official notice of issuance on the New York Stock Exchange.
     (xxiii) The Company is not, and immediately after the sale of the Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not be, an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
     On the basis of the representations, warranties and covenants herein contained, and subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to the Underwriter, and the Underwriter agrees to purchase from the Company, at a price of $33.75 per Share, 3,000,000 Firm Shares.
2. Purchase, Sale and Delivery of the Shares.
          Payment for the Firm Shares to be sold hereunder is to be made by Federal Funds wire transfer to an account designated by the Company for the Firm Shares to be sold by the Company against delivery of the Firm Shares therefor to the Underwriter. Such payment and delivery are to be made at the offices of UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10171, at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on November 22, 2005 or at such other time and date thereafter as you and the Company shall agree upon, such time and date being herein referred to as the "Closing Date." (As used herein, "business day" means a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which banks in New York are open for business and not permitted by law or executive order to be closed). The Firm Shares will be delivered by Mellon Investor Services L.L.C. (the "Transfer Agent") in such
 
denominations and in such registrations as the Underwriter requests in writing not later than the second full business day prior to the Closing Date, and will be delivered through book entry facilities of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and made available for inspection by the Underwriter at least one business day prior to the Closing Date at such place as the Underwriter, DTC and the Company shall agree.
          In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the Underwriter to purchase the Option Shares at the price per share as set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 2. The option granted hereby may be exercised in whole or in part by giving notice (i) at any time before the Closing Date and (ii) only once thereafter within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, by the Underwriter to the Company setting forth the number of Option Shares as to which the Underwriter is exercising the option and the time and date at which such certificates are to be delivered. The time and date at which the Option Shares are to be delivered shall be determined by the Underwriter but shall not be earlier than three nor later than 10 full business days after the exercise of such option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Date (such time and date being herein referred to as the "Option Closing Date"). If the date of exercise of the option is three or more days before the Closing Date, the notice of exercise shall set the Closing Date as the Option Closing Date. The option with respect to the Option Shares granted hereunder may be exercised only to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Shares by the Underwriter. You, as the Underwriter, may cancel such option at any time prior to its expiration by giving written notice of such cancellation to the Company. To the extent, if any, that the option is exercised, payment for the Option Shares shall be made by Federal Funds wire transfer to an account designated by the Company for the Option Shares to be sold by the Company against delivery of the Option Shares through the facilities of DTC. Such payment and delivery are to be made at the offices of UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10171, at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the Option Closing Date. To the extent, if any, that the option is exercised, the Option Shares will be delivered by the Transfer Agent in such denominations and in such registrations as the Underwriter requests in writing not later than the second full business day prior to the Option Closing Date, and will be delivered through book entry facilities of DTC and made available for inspection by the Underwriter at least one business day prior to the Closing Date at such place as the Underwriter, DTC and the Company shall agree.
     It is understood that the Underwriter is to make a public offering of the Shares as soon as the Underwriter deems it advisable to do so. The Shares are to be initially offered to the public at the price and upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Underwriter may from time to time thereafter change the public offering price and other selling terms.
3. Offering by the Underwriter.
     The Company covenants and agrees with the Underwriter that:
4. Covenants of the Company.
     (i) The Company will (a) prepare and timely file with the Commission under Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations, if the final form of the prospectus is not included in the Registration Statement at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective, a Prospectus containing information previously omitted at the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement in reliance on Rule 430A, if applicable, of the Rules and Regulations, (b) use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to remain in effect as to the Shares for so long as the Underwriter may deem necessary in order to complete the distribution of the Shares, (c) not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus, or document incorporated by reference therein, of which the Underwriter shall not previously have been advised and furnished with a copy or to which the Underwriter shall have reasonably objected in writing or which is not in compliance with the Rules and Regulations for so long as the
 
Underwriter may deem necessary in order to complete the distribution of the Shares and (d) file on a timely basis all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and prior to the termination of the offering of the Shares by the Underwriter; provided, however, that for each such report or definitive proxy or information statement, the Company will not file any such report or definitive proxy or information statement, or amendment thereto, of which the Underwriter shall not previously have been advised and furnished with a copy or to which the Underwriter shall have reasonably objected in writing or which is not in compliance with the Rules and Regulations.
     (ii) The Company will advise the Underwriter promptly of any request of the Commission for amendment of the Registration Statement or for supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the use of the Prospectus or of the institution of any proceedings for that purpose for so long as the Underwriter may deem necessary in order to complete the distribution of the Shares, or of the suspension of the qualification of the Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and the Company will use its best efforts to prevent (a) the issuance of any such stop order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus, or (b) any such suspension of the qualification of the Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and to obtain as soon as possible the lifting of any such stop order, if issued, or such suspension of qualification.
     (iii) The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Underwriter, from time to time, as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Underwriter during the period when delivery of a Prospectus is required under the Securities Act, as many copies of the Prospectus in final form, or as thereafter amended or supplemented, as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to the Underwriter at or before the Closing Date, one signed copy of the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto including all exhibits filed therewith, and will deliver to the Underwriter such number of copies of the Registration Statement, including documents incorporated by reference therein, but without exhibits, and of all amendments thereto, as the Underwriter may reasonably request.
     (iv) Subject to the provisions of Section 4(i) above, if during the period in which a prospectus is required by law to be delivered by the Underwriter or a dealer any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriter, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or, if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with law.
     (v) The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the Exchange Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to security holders as soon as practicable an earnings statement in conformity with Rule 158 under the Securities Act for the purpose of, and to provide the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.
 
     (vi) The Company will, for a period of five years from the Closing Date, deliver to the Underwriter copies of annual reports and copies of all other documents, reports and information furnished by the Company to its stockholders or filed with any securities exchange pursuant to the requirements of such exchange or with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The Company will deliver to the Underwriter similar reports with respect to significant subsidiaries, as that term is defined in the Rules and Regulations, which are not consolidated in the Company's financial statements.
     (vii) The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified under the heading "Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus.
     (viii) No offering, sale or other disposition of any Common Stock of the Company will be made for a period of 90 days after the date of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, by the Company otherwise than hereunder or with the prior written consent of the Underwriter except that the Company may, without such consent, (i) issue securities under the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004; (ii) issue shares upon the exercise of options or other stock rights issued pursuant to the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004; (iii) sell shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Amended and Restated Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan filed with the Commission on May 21, 2003; or (iv) issue shares of Common Stock upon conversion of any shares of 6% Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding as of the date hereof.
     The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: the fees incident to the issuance and delivery of the Shares; accounting fees of the Company; the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; the cost of printing and delivering to, or as requested by, the Underwriter, copies of the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectuses, the Prospectus, this Agreement, the applicable listing agreement for the New York Stock Exchange; the filing fees of the Commission; the filing fees and expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) incident to securing any required review by the NASD of the terms of the sale of the Shares; the fees incident to the listing agreement for the New York Stock Exchange.

The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of the Underwriter's expenses except that, if this Agreement shall not be consummated because the conditions in Section 7 hereof are not satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriter pursuant to Section 6 hereof, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(i)(a) hereof, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on its part to be performed, unless such failure to satisfy said condition or to comply with said terms be due to the default or omission of the Underwriter, then the Company shall reimburse the Underwriter for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing to market the Shares or in contemplation of performing its obligations hereunder, but the Company shall not in any event be liable to the Underwriter for damages on account of loss of anticipated profits from the sale of the Shares.

     (ii) The Underwriter shall have received on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, the opinion of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP, counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, and addressed to the Underwriter, to the effect that:
     (a) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.
     (b) The Company is duly qualified to transact business in all jurisdictions in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, and in which the failure to qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (e) The Registration Statement, the Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder (except that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial or statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein).
     (f) The statements under the caption "Description of Our Common Stock" in the Prospectus, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of documents referred to therein or matters of law, are accurate summaries and fairly and correctly present in all material respects the information called for with respect to such documents and matters.
     (g) The statements under the caption "Certain Government Regulations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any amendments thereto, for the fiscal
 
year ended December 31, 2004 as to matters of law stated therein, have been reviewed by such counsel and constitute fair summaries of the matters described therein which are material to the business or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company.
     (h) Such counsel does not know of any contracts or documents required to be filed as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto which are not so filed, incorporated by reference or described as required, and such contracts and documents as are summarized in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto are fairly summarized in all material respects.
     (i) Such counsel knows of no material legal proceedings pending or threatened against the Company, except as set forth in the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (j) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated, including the issuance and sale of the Shares and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, do not and will not conflict with or constitute a violation of any statute or conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, the charter or by-laws of the Company, any material agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or the Company's properties may be bound or any order known to such counsel or rule or regulation applicable to the Company or the Company's properties of any court or governmental agency or body.

     (n) The Company is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
     In addition, either such counsel or Arnold & Porter LLP, special tax counsel to the Company, will provide an opinion, based on such counsel's own review of the Company's certificate of incorporation, stating that the Company was organized and continues to be organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and, based on such counsel's review of the Company's federal income tax returns and discussions with management and independent public accountants for the Company, that the Company, taking into
 
account operations for its taxable and fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 through December 31, 2004, satisfied the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for such years and that its proposed method of operation will enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for its taxable and fiscal year ending December 31, 2005. Furthermore, such counsel shall opine that the statements contained under the heading "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Registration Statement or Prospectus and under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any amendments, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax treatment of the Company and of its stockholders.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters governed by the laws of states other than the laws of State of Ohio, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware or Federal laws on local counsel in such jurisdictions, provided that in such case such counsel shall state that they believe that they and the Underwriter are justified in relying on such other counsel and such other counsel shall indicate that the Underwriter may rely on such opinion. As to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, such counsel may rely on certificates of officers of the Company and public officials so long as such counsel states that they have no reason to believe that either the Underwriter or they are not justified in relying on such certificates. In addition to the matters set forth above, the opinion of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP shall also include a statement to the effect that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which leads them to believe that (a) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, as of the time it became effective under the Securities Act, or any of the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus after the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as of the date when such document was filed with the Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (b) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, on the date it was filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (y) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or any of the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus after the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as of the date when such document was filed with the Commission, or as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements, schedules and other financial information included therein), and (z) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the date it was filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), or as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements, schedules and other financial information included therein). With respect to such statement, Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP, may state that this statement is based upon the procedures set forth or incorporated by reference therein, but is without independent check and verification.
     (iii) The Underwriter shall have received from Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriter, an opinion dated the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the
 
case may be, with respect to the organization of the Company, the validity of the Shares, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Underwriter reasonably may request and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.
     (iv) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Underwriter shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a signed letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter, dated the date hereof (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission and (b) stating, as of the date hereof (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given in the Prospectus, as of a date not more than five days prior to the date hereof), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters ordinarily covered by accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings.
     (v) With respect to the letter of Ernst & Young LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Underwriter concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letter"), the Company shall have furnished to the Underwriter a letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter (the "bring-down letter"), of such accountants, dated the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (b) stating, as of the date of the bring-down letter (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given in the Prospectus, as of a date not more than five days prior to the date of the bring-down letter), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters covered by the initial letters and (c) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letters.
     (vi) The Underwriter shall have received on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, a certificate or certificates of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, each of them severally represents as follows:
     (a) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceedings for such purpose have been taken or are, to his knowledge, contemplated by the Commission.
     (b) He does not know of any litigation instituted or threatened against the Company of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not so disclosed therein or in a document incorporated by reference therein; he does not know of any material contract required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement which is not so filed therein or in a document incorporated by reference therein.
 
     (c) He has carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in his opinion, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, were true and correct, and such Registration Statement and Prospectus, or any document incorporated by reference therein, did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and, in his opinion, since the effective date of the Registration Statement, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Prospectus which has not been so set forth in such supplement or amendment.
     (d) The representations and warranties of the Company as set forth in this Agreement are true and correct as of the Closing Date as if made on such date. The Company has performed all of its obligations under this Agreement as are to be performed at or before the Closing Date. The representations and warranties made in this clause (d) shall be deemed made by the Company.
     (vii) The Underwriter shall have received at or prior to the Closing Date, an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter, signed by the directors and executive officers of the Company to the effect that they will not, prior to the expiration of 90 days from the date of this Agreement, offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock of the Company or any securities that the directors and executive officers has, or will have the right to acquire through the exercise of options, warrants, subscription or other rights without the prior written consent of the Underwriter, except (i) pursuant to bona fide gifts, provided that the Company shall have delivered to the Underwriter written consent to such gift, but in no event shall the gifts under this subsection (i) of the executive officers and directors exceed 75,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, (ii) pursuant to routine dispositions under Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plans entered into by certain directors and officers of the Company as of or prior to the date hereof, and (iii) shares obtained pursuant to the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors, provided that the Company shall have delivered to the Underwriter written consent to such sale, but in no event shall the sales under this subsection (iii) of the executive officers and directors exceed 300,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate.
     (viii) The Shares to be sold by the Company as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange.
          The opinions and certificates mentioned in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in all material respects reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriter and to Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriter.
          If any of the conditions hereinabove provided for in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement to be fulfilled, the obligations of the Underwriter hereunder may be terminated by the Underwriter by notifying the Company of such termination in writing or by telecopy at or prior to the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be. In such event, the Company and the Underwriter shall not be under any obligation to each other (except to the extent provided in Sections 5 and 8 hereof).
     The obligations of the Company to sell and deliver the portion of the Shares required to be delivered as and when specified in this Agreement are subject to the conditions that at the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, no stop

order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and in effect or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened.
     
8. Indemnification.
     (i) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, its officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (b) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in light of the circumstances under which they were made, or (c) any act or failure to act, or any alleged act or failure to act by the Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Shares or the offering contemplated hereby, and will reimburse the Underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof; and provided further that as to any Preliminary Prospectus this indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter, its officers and directors, or any person controlling the Underwriter on account of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of any Shares to any person by the Underwriter if the Underwriter failed to send or give a copy of the Prospectus, as the same may be amended or supplemented, to that person within the time required by the Securities Act, and the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus, unless such failure resulted from non-compliance by the Company with Sections 4(iii) or 4(iv). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (ii) The Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will
 
reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Underwriter may otherwise have.
     (iii) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing; that the failure to so notify will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that the indemnifying party may have on account of the provisions of Sections 8(i) or (ii) or otherwise, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall not have otherwise learned of such proceeding and such failure is materially prejudicial to the indemnifying party. In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event (a) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (b) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit notwithstanding its obligation to bear the fees and expenses of such counsel. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties and one local counsel. Such firm shall be designated in writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(i) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(ii). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the fifth sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent to which the indemnification obligations of the Company hereunder are applicable if (a) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (b) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
provided
 
     (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless to the extent required therein an indemnified party under Sections 8(i) or (ii) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriter from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(iii) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriter in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriter shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Underwriter bear to the total proceeds of the offering (the proceeds received by the Underwriter being equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter), in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(iv) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(iv). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(iv) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(iv), (a) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Shares purchased by the Underwriter and (b) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     (v) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 8 hereby consents to the jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon him or it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join him or it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.
     All communications hereunder shall be in writing and, except as otherwise provided herein, will be mailed, delivered or telecopied and confirmed as follows: if to the Underwriter, to UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York, 10171, Attention: Equity Capital Markets; if to the Company, to Health Care REIT, Inc., One SeaGate, Suite 1500, Toledo, Ohio 43603-

12. Information Provided by Underwriter.
 
     The reimbursement, indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Agreement and the representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or controlling person thereof, or by or on behalf of the Company or its directors or officers and (iii) delivery of and payment for the Shares under this Agreement.
13. Miscellaneous.
          The Company hereby acknowledges that the Underwriter is acting solely as an underwriter in connection with the purchase and sale of the Company's securities. The Company further acknowledges that the Underwriter is acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Underwriting Agreement entered into on an arm's length basis and in no event do the parties intend that the Underwriter act or be responsible as a fiduciary to the Company, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that the Underwriter may undertake or has undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Company's securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Underwriter hereby expressly disclaims any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Company, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Underwriting Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect.

You have requested our opinion regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement. Certain capitalized terms used herein without definition are as defined in the Registration Statement.
     In giving this opinion, we have examined the following:

     In connection with the opinions rendered below, we have assumed with your consent that:
     1. Each of the documents referred to above has been duly authorized, executed and delivered; is authentic, if an original, or is accurate, if a copy; and has not been amended;
     2. During its taxable years ended December 31, 1998 through December 31, 2004, the Company has operated, and, in future taxable years, the Company will operate, in a manner that has caused or will make, as the case may be, the factual representations relating to the ownership, operation, future method of operations, and compliance of the Company with the real estate investment trust ("REIT") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury Regulations (the "Regulations") thereunder, as in effect as of the date hereof, contained in a certificate, dated November 17, 2005 and executed by a duly appointed officer of the Company (the "Officer's Certificate"), true for such years;
     3. The Company will not make any amendments to its organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would affect its qualification as a REIT under sections 856-860 of the Code for any taxable year; and
     4. No action will be taken by the Company after the date hereof that would have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinions set forth below are based.
     In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinions rendered below. For the purposes of rendering these opinions, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in any documents delivered to us, including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate. We have relied completely upon the Company's representations that the information presented in such documents accurately reflects all material facts. In the course of our representation of the Company, we have not been made aware of any facts inconsistent with such factual representations. In addition, where such factual representations involve terms defined or used in the Code, the Regulations, published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") or other relevant authority, we have explained such terms to the Company's representatives and are satisfied that the Company's representatives understand such terms and are capable of making such factual representations.
     Based on the Code, Regulations, documents, assumptions and statements set forth above, the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate and our review of
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. November 17, 2005 Page 3
the discussions in the Prospectus under the caption "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 under the caption "Taxation," we are of the opinion that:
     (a) the Company qualified to be taxed as a REIT pursuant to sections 856 through 860 of the Code for its taxable years ended December 31, 2000 through December 31, 2004, and the Company's organization and current and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for all future taxable years; and
     (b) the descriptions of the law and the legal conclusions contained in the Prospectus under the caption "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 under the caption "Taxation," fairly summarize the federal income tax considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Common Stock.
     We will not review on a continuing basis the Company's compliance with the documents or assumptions set forth above, or the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
     The foregoing opinions are based on current provisions of the Code and the Regulations, published administrative interpretations thereof and published court decisions and assume that none of these will change. No assurance, however, can be given that the law will not change in a way that will prevent the Company from qualifying as a REIT.
     The foregoing opinions are limited to the U.S. federal income tax matters addressed herein, and no other opinions are rendered with respect to other federal tax matters or to any issues arising under the tax laws of any other country, or any state or locality. You must judge for yourselves whether the matters addressed in this opinion letter are sufficient for your purposes.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
     The following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of Health Care REIT, Inc. for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto. Other important factors are identified in "Item 1  Business" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Executive Overview
     
Business
     Health Care REIT, Inc. is a self-administered, equity real estate investment trust that invests in health care facilities, primarily skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. We also invest in specialty care facilities. Founded in 1970, we were the first REIT to invest exclusively in health care facilities. As of December 31, 2004, long-term care facilities, which include skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, comprised approximately 93% of our investment portfolio. The following table summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2004:
 
     Our primary objectives are to protect stockholders' capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest primarily in long-term care facilities managed by experienced operators and diversify our investment portfolio by operator and geographic location.
     Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our operators' continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us. To the extent that our operators experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of health care facility and operator. Our monitoring process includes review of monthly financial statements for each facility, quarterly review of operator credit, annual facility inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze facility-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks. Through these monitoring and research efforts, we are typically able to intervene at
 
an early stage and address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment.
     In addition to our monitoring and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. We typically invest in or finance up to 90% of the appraised value of a property. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2004, 85% of our real property was subject to master leases, 96% of our real estate investments were cross-defaulted with other investments relating to the same operator and 78% of our real property loans were cross-collateralized with other loans to the same operator.
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, rental income and interest income represented 90% and 9%, respectively, of total gross revenues. Prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. This lease structure will initially generate lower revenues, net income and funds from operations compared to leases with fixed escalators that require straight-lining, but will enable us to generate additional organic growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. This change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.
     Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we anticipate making additional investments in health care related facilities. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements, internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property. Our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements, is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence of secured debt. We believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations, meet debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make dividend distributions and finance future investments.
     Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we completed $584,931,000 of gross new investments and had $62,584,000 of real property sales and mortgage loan payoffs, resulting in net investments of $522,347,000. We previously issued investment guidance indicating that we anticipated net new investments of $250,000,000 in 2005. We recently adjusted our net new investment guidance for 2005 to $200,000,000, due to the anticipated disposition of two investments totaling approximately $50,000,000 that were not in the original guidance. Although no additional investment payoffs have been specifically identified, we anticipate the potential repayment of certain mortgage loans receivable and the possible sale of additional real property. To the extent that mortgage loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any mortgage loan repayments and real property sales in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements. At December 31, 2004, we had $19,763,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $189,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements.
 
Key Transactions in 2004
We completed the following key transactions during the year ended December 31, 2004:
     
Key Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties
     We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, concentration risk and credit strength. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.
     We believe that net income available to common stockholders ("NICS") is the most appropriate earnings measure. Other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations ("FFO") and funds available for distribution ("FAD"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). Please refer to the section entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for further discussion of FFO and FAD and for reconciliations of FFO and FAD to NICS. NICS, FFO, FAD and their relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our operating performance measures (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
Operating Performance.
 
     We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. Our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization ("DBCR") and debt to market capitalization ("DMCR"). The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt. We expect to maintain a DBCR between 40% and 50% and a DMCR between 30% and 40%. Our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio ("ICR") and fixed charge coverage ratio ("FCR"). The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest plus preferred dividends). We expect to maintain an ICR in excess of 3.00 times and an FCR in excess of 2.50 times. The coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") which is discussed in further detail, and reconciled to net income, below in "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures:
Credit Strength.
     We evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix, investment mix, operator mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Asset mix measures the portion of our investments that are real property. In order to qualify as an equity REIT, at least 75% of our real estate investments must be real property whereby each property, which includes the land, buildings, improvements and related rights, is owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a long-term operating lease. Investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various facility types. We invest primarily in long-term care facilities. Operator mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five operators. We try to limit our top five operators to 50% of our total real estate investments. Geographic mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five states. We try to limit our top five states to 50% of our total real estate investments. The following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk:
Concentration Risk.
 
     We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited to:
 
     Management regularly monitors the economic and other factors listed above. We develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. Please refer to "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors" below for further discussion of these risk factors.
     Portfolio Update
     Payment coverages in our portfolio continue to improve. Our overall payment coverage is at 1.78 times and represents an increase of 25 basis points from the prior year. The table below is a summary of the key performance measures for our portfolio. Census and payor mix data reflects the three months ended September 30, 2004. Coverage data reflects the 12 months ended September 30, 2004.
     . At December 31, 2004, our assisted living portfolio was comprised of 234 facilities with 15,776 units and an investment balance of $1,335,717,000. The stabilized portfolio was comprised of 230 facilities with 15,115 units, an investment balance of $1,298,820,000, and payment coverage of 1.45 times, an increase of 14 basis points from the prior year. Our fill-up and construction properties remained within our stated goal of having no more than 10% to 15% of the portfolio in construction and fill-up. We currently have two assisted living facilities remaining in fill-up, representing less than 1% of our revenues. Only one facility has occupancy of less than 50%. Finally, we have two assisted living facilities in construction.
Assisted Living Portfolio
     . At December 31, 2004, our skilled nursing portfolio was comprised of 152 facilities with 20,975 beds and an investment balance of $965,328,000. Average occupancies have risen from a low of 81% in the third quarter of 2000 to 87% in the third quarter of 2004. Our payment coverage remains strong at 2.11 times, an increase of 36 basis points from the prior year.
Skilled Nursing Portfolio
     . At December 31, 2004, our specialty care portfolio was comprised of eight facilities with 1,111 beds and an investment balance of $151,833,000. Our payment coverage remains strong at 2.69 times, an increase of 77 basis points from the prior year.
Specialty Care Portfolio
     
Corporate Governance
     Maintaining investor confidence and trust has become increasingly important in today's business environment. Health Care REIT, Inc.'s Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal requirements. In March 2004, the Board of Directors adopted its Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are available on our Web site at www.hcreit.com and from us upon written request sent to the Vice President and Corporate Secretary, Health Care REIT, Inc., One SeaGate, Suite 1500, P.O. Box 1475, Toledo, Ohio, 43603-1475.
     On July 30, 2002, President George W. Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"). SOX is designed to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures. SOX directed the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to promulgate all necessary rules and regula-
 
tions. We believe we are in compliance with all of the new listing guidelines of the NYSE relating to corporate governance as well as the applicable provisions of SOX and the rules of the SEC adopted under SOX. The following is a summary of some of the important SOX related corporate governance initiatives for which we are compliant.
 
     In addition to the items discussed above, the SEC has issued its final rules regarding compliance with SOX Section 404, Management Assessment of Internal Controls ("SOX404"). Pursuant to SOX404, we must develop enhanced procedures to understand, document, evaluate and monitor our internal controls and procedures for financial statement purposes. Beginning with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, we must provide an assessment report from management on the effectiveness of our internal controls. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management's assertions. See "Item 9A  Controls and Procedures" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 for additional information. We implemented a SOX404 compliance plan in April 2003 and have completed all necessary documentation and testing of our internal controls in time to provide the required management report for the current year. To date, we have incurred costs (both internal and external) related to SOX404 and other corporate governance compliance initiatives and we anticipate that we will incur additional costs. These costs are included in general and administrative expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     
Sources and Uses of Cash
     Our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, borrowings under unsecured lines of credit arrangements, public and private offerings of debt and equity securities, proceeds from the sales of real property and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property acquisitions, loan advances and general and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows (dollars in thousands):
     . The increases in net cash provided from operating activities are primarily attributable to increases in net income and the provision for depreciation offset by changes in receivables and other assets. Net income and the provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of net new investments in properties owned by us. See the discussion of investing activities below for additional details. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation will change accordingly. Changes in receivables and other assets are primarily due to timing of cash receipts relating to rent, debt service and other contractual obligations and the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.
Operating Activities
 
     . The increases in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to increases in net real property investments. At December 31, 2004, 90% of our real estate investments were real property investments. The investment activity during the year ended December 31, 2004 was approximately 95% real property investments and 5% loans. Investments for the year ended December 31, 2004 included the acquisition of 22 assisted living facilities and 52 skilled nursing facilities for $518,891,000, including the assumption of debt totaling $14,555,000. The remaining $38,211,000 of real property investments relates primarily to funding of construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $9,523,000 related to construction advances on two assisted living facilities. For the same period in 2003, we acquired 69 assisted living facilities and 26 skilled nursing facilities for $474,385,000. The prior year acquisitions included the assumption of debt totaling $101,243,000 and the issuance of preferred stock totaling $26,500,000, resulting in $346,643,000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions. In addition, we advanced $63,770,000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $29,496,000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility. We converted $36,794,000 of completed construction projects relating to one assisted living facility and the specialty care facility into operating lease properties in 2003. For the same period in 2002, we acquired 24 assisted living facilities, 21 skilled nursing facilities and one specialty care facility for $354,672,000. The 2002 acquisitions included the assumption of debt which reduced the amount funded by $2,248,000, resulting in $352,424,000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions. In addition, we advanced $57,282,000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $19,595,000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility.
Investing Activities
     . The changes in net cash provided from or used in financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt, preferred stock issuances and redemptions, common stock issuances and cash distributions to stockholders. In September 2002, we issued $150,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in September 2012, at an effective yield of 8.05%. In March 2003, we issued $100,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in September 2012, at an effective yield of 7.40%. These notes were an add-on to the $150,000,000 senior unsecured notes issued in September 2002. In November 2003, we issued $250,000,000 of 6.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in November 2013, at an effective yield of 6.01%. In September 2004, we issued $50,000,000 of 6.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in November 2013, at an effective yield of 5.68%. These notes were an add-on to the $250,000,000 senior unsecured notes issued in November 2003. We extinguished $40,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes that matured in April 2004.
Financing Activities
     There was no preferred stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2002. In July 2003, we closed on a public offering of 4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, which generated net proceeds of approximately $96,850,000. The shares have a liquidation value of $25 per share. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us on or after July 9, 2008. A portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all 3,000,000 shares of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on July 15, 2003, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
     In September 2003, we issued 1,060,000 shares of 6% Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock as partial consideration for an acquisition of assets by us, with the shares valued at $26,500,000 for such purposes. The shares were issued to Southern Assisted Living, Inc. and certain of its shareholders without registration in reliance upon the federal statutory exemption of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The shares have a liquidation value of $25 per share. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us on or after August 15, 2008. The preferred shares are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $32.66 per share at any time. As of December 31, 2004, certain holders of our Series E Preferred Stock have converted 709,955 shares into 543,438 shares of our common stock, leaving 350,045 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2004.
     In September 2004, we closed on a public offering of 7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, which generated net proceeds of approximately $169,107,000. The shares have a liquidation value of $25 per share. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us
 
on or after September 14, 2009. The proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements and to invest in additional health care properties.
     The change in common stock issuances is primarily attributable to public and private issuances in 2002 and 2003. In February 2002, we issued 906,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value, at a price of $27.59 per share, which generated net proceeds of approximately $23,657,000. In May 2002, we issued 3,450,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value, at a price of $28.00 per share, which generated net proceeds of approximately $91,578,000. In November 2002, we issued 930,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value, at a price of $26.90 per share, which generated net proceeds of approximately $24,952,000.
     In July 2003, we issued 1,583,100 shares of common stock, $1 par value, at a price of $30.32 per share, which generated net proceeds of approximately $47,950,000. In September 2003, we issued 3,200,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value, at a price of $30.25 per share, which generated net proceeds of approximately $91,583,000. In October 2003, we issued an additional 480,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the over-allotment exercise, which generated net proceeds of approximately $13,795,000.
     The remaining difference in common stock issuances is primarily related to our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan ("DRIP"), stock option exercises, restricted stock grants and preferred stock conversions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we issued 355,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our DRIP, which generated net proceeds of $9,572,000. In May 2003, we instituted our enhanced DRIP. Existing stockholders, in addition to reinvesting dividends, may purchase up to $5,000 of common stock per month at a discount. Previously, stockholders could only purchase once per quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we issued 1,533,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our DRIP, which generated net proceeds of approximately $51,575,000 as compared to 2,277,000 shares issued and $68,860,000 of net proceeds generated for the same period in 2003. As of February 28, 2005, we had an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue up to 6,314,213 shares of common stock pursuant to our DRIP. As of February 28, 2005, 4,357,361 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under this registration statement.
     In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding capital gains) to our stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we paid dividends totaling $122,987,000 (or $2.385 per share) and $12,737,000 to holders of our common stock and preferred stock, respectively. For the same periods in 2003, we paid dividends totaling $101,863,000 (or $2.34 per share) and $9,218,000 to holders of our common stock and preferred stock, respectively. For the same periods in 2002, we paid dividends totaling $84,671,000 (or $2.34 per share) and $12,468,000 to holders of our common stock and preferred stock, respectively. The increase in common stock dividends is primarily attributable to the increase in common stock outstanding as discussed below in "Results of Operations."
     
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     We have guaranteed the payment of industrial revenue bonds for one assisted living facility in the event that the present owner defaults upon its obligations. In consideration for this guaranty, we receive and recognize fees annually related to this arrangement. This guaranty expires upon the repayment of the industrial revenue bonds which currently mature in 2009. At December 31, 2004, we were contingently liable for $3,195,000 under this guaranty.
     We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit of certain insurance companies that provide workers' compensation insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation under the letter of credit matures in 2009. At December 31, 2004, our obligation under the letter of credit was $2,450,000.
     We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings, but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates. As of December 31, 2004, we participated in two interest rate swap
 
agreements related to our long-term debt. Our interest rate swaps are discussed below in "Contractual Obligations."
     
Contractual Obligations
     The following table summarizes our payment requirements under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 (in thousands):
 
     We have an unsecured credit arrangement with a consortium of eight banks providing for a revolving line of credit ("revolving credit") in the amount of $310,000,000, which expires on May 15, 2006 (with the ability to extend for one year at our discretion if we are in compliance with all covenants). The agreement specifies that borrowings under the revolving credit are subject to interest payable in periods no longer than three months at either the agent bank's prime rate of interest or 1.3% over LIBOR interest rate, at our option (3.7375% at December 31, 2004). In addition, we pay a commitment fee based on an annual rate of 0.325% and an annual agent's fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the agreement. We have another unsecured line of credit arrangement with a consortium of three banks for a total of $30,000,000, which expires May 31, 2005. Borrowings under this line of credit are subject to interest at either the lead bank's prime rate of interest (5.25% at December 31, 2004) or 2.0% over LIBOR interest rate, at our option, and are due on demand. At December 31, 2004, we had $151,000,000 outstanding under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements and estimated total contractual interest obligations of $6,410,000. Contractual interest obligations are estimated based on the assumption that the balance of $151,000,000 at December 31, 2004 is constant until maturity at interest rates in effect at December 31, 2004.
     We have $875,000,000 of senior unsecured notes with fixed annual interest rates ranging from 6% to 8.17%, payable semi-annually. Total contractual interest obligations on senior unsecured notes totaled $394,191,000 at December 31, 2004. Additionally, we have 32 mortgage loans totaling $160,225,000, collateralized by health care facilities, with fixed annual interest rates ranging from 5.5% to 12%, payable monthly. The carrying values of the health care properties securing the mortgage loans totaled $233,591,000 at December 31, 2004. Total contractual interest obligations on mortgage loans totaled $139,454,000 at December 31, 2004.
     On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements (the "Swaps") for a total notional amount of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 6% and pay a
 
variable rate based on six-month LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2004, total contractual interest obligations were estimated to be $31,320,000.
     At December 31, 2004, we had operating lease obligations of $16,036,000 relating to our office space, six assisted living facilities and three skilled nursing facilities.
     Purchase obligations are comprised of unfunded construction commitments and contingent purchase obligations. At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding construction financings of $26,183,000 ($25,463,000 for leased properties and $720,000 for construction loans) and were committed to providing additional financing of approximately $3,833,000 to complete construction. At December 31, 2004, we had contingent purchase obligations totaling $82,815,000. These contingent purchase obligations primarily relate to deferred acquisition fundings. Deferred acquisition fundings are contingent upon a tenant satisfying certain conditions in the lease. Upon funding, amounts due from the tenant are increased to reflect the additional investment in the property.
     
Capital Structure
     As of December 31, 2004, we had stockholders' equity of $1,335,279,000 and a total outstanding debt balance of $1,186,225,000, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 47%. Our ratio of debt to market capitalization was 34% at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our coverage ratio of EBITDA to interest was 3.24 to 1.00. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.77 to 1.00. Also, at December 31, 2004, we had $19,763,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $189,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements.
     Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest payable.
     Our senior unsecured notes are rated Baa3 (stable), BBB- (stable) and BBB- (positive) by Moody's Investors Service, Standard and Poor's Investor Service and Fitch Ratings, respectively. We plan to manage the Company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.
     As of February 28, 2005, we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue up to $356,794,619 of securities including debt securities, common and preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units. We filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 1, 2004 for the issuance of up to $1,081,794,619 of securities to replace the existing shelf registration. We anticipate that this shelf registration will be effective in the first half of 2005. Also, as of February 28, 2005, we had an effective registration statement on file in connection with our enhanced DRIP program under which we may issue up to 6,314,213 shares of common stock. As of February 28, 2005, 4,357,361 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under this registration statement. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional health care facilities and to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements.
 
Results of Operations
     Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $72,634,000, or $1.39 per diluted share, as compared with $70,732,000, or $1.60 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003 and $55,191,000, or $1.48 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Net income available to common stockholders increased on a year-to-date basis primarily due to an increase in rental income offset by increases in interest expense and provision for depreciation. These changes are discussed in further detail below. Although net income available to common stockholders increased by 3% from 2003 and 32% from 2002, it decreased on a per share basis primarily due to significantly higher outstanding shares. On a fully diluted basis, average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 52,082,000, an 18% increase from 44,201,000 for the same period in 2003 and a 40% increase from 37,301,000 for the same period in 2002. The increase in fully diluted average common shares outstanding is primarily the result of public and private common stock offerings, common stock issuances pursuant to our DRIP and conversions of preferred stock into common stock. The following table represents the changes in outstanding common stock for the period from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2004 (amounts in thousands):
     FFO for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $146,742,000, or $2.82 per diluted share, as compared with $119,463,000, or $2.70 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003 and $96,573,000, or $2.59 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. The increase in FFO is primarily due to increases in net income available to common stockholders and the provision for depreciation. FAD for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $132,950,000, or $2.55 per diluted share, as compared to $104,535,000, or $2.36 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003 and $87,317,000, or $2.34 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. The increase in FAD is primarily due to increases in net income available to common stockholders and the provision for depreciation offset by changes in rental income in excess of cash received. Please refer to the discussion of "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for further information regarding FFO and FAD and for reconciliations of FFO and FAD to NICS.
     EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $238,264,000, as compared with $199,349,000 for the same period in 2003 and $155,208,000 for the same period in 2002. The increase in EBITDA is primarily due to increases in net income, interest expense and provision for depreciation. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest was 3.24 times for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with 3.50 times for the same period in 2003 and 3.67 times for the same period in 2002. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.77 times for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with 3.01 times for the same period in 2003 and 2.84 times for the same period in 2002. Our coverage ratios declined from the prior years primarily due to the fact that interest expense increased 29% to $73,431,000 from $56,912,000 in 2003 and
 
74% from $42,271,000 in 2002, whereas EBITDA only increased by 20% from 2003 and 54% from 2002. The increase in interest expense is discussed in further detail below. Please refer to the discussion of "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for further information regarding EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA and net income.
     Revenues were comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
     The increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new properties for which we receive rent offset by sales of real property. Investments for the year ended December 31, 2004 included the acquisition of 22 assisted living facilities and 52 skilled nursing facilities for $518,891,000, including the assumption of debt totaling $14,555,000. The remaining $38,211,000 of real property investments related primarily to funding of construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $9,523,000 related to construction advances on two assisted living facilities. For the same period in 2003, we acquired 69 assisted living facilities and 26 skilled nursing facilities for $474,385,000. However, the prior year acquisitions included the assumption of debt totaling $101,243,000 and the issuance of preferred stock totaling $26,500,000, resulting in $346,643,000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions. In addition, we advanced $63,770,000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $29,496,000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility. We converted $36,794,000 of completed construction projects relating to one assisted living facility and the specialty care facility into operating lease properties in 2003. For the same period in 2002, we acquired 24 assisted living facilities, 21 skilled nursing facilities and one specialty care facility for $354,672,000. However, the 2002 acquisitions included the assumption of debt which reduced the amount funded by $2,248,000, resulting in $352,424,000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions. In addition, we advanced $57,282,000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $19,595,000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold four assisted living facilities, two skilled nursing facilities and one specialty care facility, generating $37,567,000 of net proceeds. For the same period in 2003, we sold 14 assisted living facilities, two skilled nursing facilities and one parcel of land, generating $65,455,000 of net proceeds. For the same period in 2002, we sold nine assisted living facilities, generating $52,279,000 of net proceeds. Please refer to Note 15 of our audited financial statements for amounts excluded from rental income related to properties reclassified as discontinued operations.
     As discussed above, prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. While this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends, it is anticipated that we will generate additional organic growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Sales of real property would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues. Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. As of December 31, 2004, we had no leases expiring prior to 2009.
 
     Interest income decreased from 2002 primarily due to lower average yields on our loans receivable and non-recognition of interest income related to loans on non-accrual. Interest income increased from 2003 primarily due to a full year of interest income on loans made in 2003 and recognition of interest income related to our mortgage loans with Doctors Community Healthcare Corporation as a result of the bankruptcy resolution. Transaction fees and other income fluctuated primarily due to the $902,000 gain from the sale of our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P. in October 2003 and the resulting lack of income subsequent to the date of sale.
     Expenses were comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
     The increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to increases in interest expense, the provision for depreciation and general and administrative expenses. The increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average borrowings and changes in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting interest expense. This was partially offset by lower average interest rates and savings generated from interest rate swap agreements. In September 2002, we issued $150,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in September 2012, at an effective yield of 8.05%, resulting in 12 months of expense in the current year as compared to three months of expense in 2002 and 12 months of expense in 2003. In March 2003, we issued $100,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in September 2012, at an effective yield of 7.40%, resulting in nine months of interest expense in 2003 compared to 12 months of expense in the current year. In November 2003, we issued $250,000,000 of 6.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in November 2013, resulting in 12 months of expense in the current year as compared to no expense in 2002 and one month of expense in 2003. In September 2004, we issued $50,000,000 of 6.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in November 2013, at an effective yield of 5.68% resulting in three months of expense in the current year as compared to no expense in the prior years. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2004 we had an average daily outstanding balance of $54,770,000 under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements compared to $61,677,000 and $69,180,000 during the same periods in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Also, in 2004, we assumed $14,555,000 of secured debt with weighted average interest rates of 7.50% in conjunction with new acquisitions. In 2003, we assumed $101,243,000 of secured debt with weighted average interest rates of 7.39% in conjunction with new acquisitions. In 2002, we assumed $2,248,000 of secured debt with weighted average interest rates of 7.75% in conjunction with new acquisitions. Effective April 15, 2004, we repaid our $40,000,000 8.0% senior unsecured notes, which will result in a decrease of interest expense of $3,200,000 on an annualized basis. If we borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements, issue additional senior unsecured notes or assume additional secured debt, our interest expense will increase. Please refer to Note 15 of our audited financial statements for amounts excluded from interest expense related to properties reclassified as discontinued operations.
     We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 totaled $170,000, $1,535,000 and $875,000, respectively.
 
     On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements (the "Swaps") for a total notional amount of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month LIBOR plus a spread. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we generated $1,770,000 of savings related to our Swaps that was recorded as a reduction of interest expense. We had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002.
     The provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of additional investments in properties owned directly by us offset by sales of real property. See the discussion of rental income above for additional details. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation will change accordingly. Please refer to Note 15 of our audited financial statements for amounts excluded from the provision for depreciation related to properties reclassified as discontinued operations.
     General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues (including revenues from discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2004, were 6.54% as compared with 5.55% and 5.79% for the same periods in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Approximately one-half of the increases from 2002 and 2003 are related to costs associated with our initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives. The remainder is comprised of increases relating to professional services fees (including costs associated with SOX compliance), taxes and transition costs associated with the removal of an underperforming operator in December 2004.
     The increase in loan expense was primarily due to the additional amortization of costs related to amending our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, costs related to obtaining consents to modify the covenant packages of our senior unsecured notes and costs related to senior unsecured notes issued in 2003 and 2004.
     In May 2003, we announced the amendment and extension of our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement. The line of credit was expanded to $225,000,000 and extended to expire in May 2006 (with the ability to extend for one year at our discretion if we are in compliance with all covenants). In August 2003, we further amended the line of credit to modify certain financial covenants that enhanced our financial flexibility and aligned our covenant package with other investment-grade REITs. Finally, in December 2003 and January 2004, we expanded this line of credit to $310,000,000.
     In August and September 2003, we solicited the consents of registered holders of our senior unsecured notes to the adoption of certain amendments to the supplemental indentures to modify the indentures to require us to (a) limit the use of secured debt to 40% of undepreciated assets, (b) limit total debt to 60% of undepreciated total assets, and (c) maintain total unencumbered assets at 150% of total unsecured debt. These amendments to all of our then outstanding senior unsecured notes were intended to modernize the covenant package and make it consistent with other investment-grade REITs.
     During the year ended December 31, 2004, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of $314,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value. The estimated fair market value was determined by an offer to purchase received from a third party. During the year ended December 31, 2003, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of $2,792,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value. The estimated fair market value of the property was determined by an independent appraisal. During the year ended December 31, 2002, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from three properties did not exceed their related net book values and impairment charges of $2,298,000 were recorded to reduce the properties to their estimated fair market values. The estimated fair market values of the properties were determined by offers to purchase received from third parties or estimated net sales proceeds.
 
     In April 2002, we purchased $35,000,000 of our outstanding senior unsecured notes that were due in 2003 and recorded a charge of $403,000 in connection with this early extinguishment. No such transactions or charges occurred in 2003 or 2004.
     The provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed below in "Critical Accounting Policies." Due to collectibility concerns related to portions of our loan portfolio, we increased our allowance for losses on loans receivable by an additional $1,870,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003.
     Other items were comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
     During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, we sold properties with carrying values of $53,311,000, $61,316,000 and $37,710,000 for net losses of $1,032,000, net gains of $4,139,000 and net losses of $143,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, we sold properties with carrying values of $10,034,000 for a net loss of $134,000. Also, at September 30, 2005, six properties were classified as held for sale. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2002. In accordance with Statement No. 144, we have reclassified the income and expenses attributable to the properties held for sale at September 30, 2005 and sold subsequent to January 1, 2002 to discontinued operations. These properties generated $9,239,000, $6,236,000 and $2,325,000 of income after deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Please refer to Note 15 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
     The increase in preferred dividends is primarily due to the increase in average outstanding preferred shares. We issued 3,000,000 shares of 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in May 1998, and 3,000,000 shares of 9.0% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock in January 1999. We issued 4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in July 2003 and used the proceeds to redeem our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock. We issued 7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in September 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the holder of our Series C Preferred Stock converted 900,000 shares into 878,049 shares of our common stock, leaving 2,100,000 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the holder of our Series C Preferred Stock converted 2,100,000 shares into 2,048,781 shares of our common stock, leaving no such shares outstanding at December 31, 2003. We issued 1,060,000 shares of 6% Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock in September 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003, certain holders of our Series E Preferred Stock converted 229,556 shares into 175,714 shares of our common stock, leaving 830,444 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2004, certain holders of our Series E Preferred Stock converted 480,399 shares into 367,724 shares of our common stock, leaving 350,045 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2004.
     As noted above, in July 2003, we closed a public offering of 4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. A portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all 3,000,000 shares of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on July 15, 2003. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Topic D-42, the costs to issue these securities were recorded as a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2,790,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the third quarter of
 
2003 to reduce net income available to common stockholders. No such transactions or charges occurred in 2002 or 2004.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     We believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider FFO and FAD to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FAD represents FFO excluding the non-cash straight-line rental adjustments. Additionally, our historical results include an adjustment for a preferred stock redemption charge for the year ended December 31, 2003 but exclude adjustments for impairment charges.
     In August 2003, we adopted the SEC clarification of EITF Topic D-42. To implement the clarified accounting pronouncement, our 2003 results reflect a reduction in net income available to common stockholders resulting from a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2,790,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, due to the redemption of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in July 2003. NAREIT has issued its recommendation that preferred stock redemption charges should not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO. Although we have adopted this recommendation, we have also disclosed FFO and FAD adjusted for the preferred stock redemption charge for enhanced clarity. Additionally, we believe that the nature of the charge is non-recurring because there was not a similar charge during the two preceding years and we do not anticipate a similar charge in the succeeding two years.
     In October 2003, NAREIT informed its member companies that the SEC had changed its position on certain aspects of the NAREIT FFO definition, including impairment charges. Previously, the SEC accepted NAREIT's view that impairment charges were effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an impending sale of property and thus should be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO and FAD similar to other gains and losses on sales. However, the SEC's clarified interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO and FAD. We have adopted this interpretation and have not added back impairment charges of $2,298,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, recorded for the year ended December 31, 2002, $2,792,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, recorded for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $314,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, recorded for the year ended December 31, 2004.
     EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Additionally, we exclude the non-cash provision for loan losses in calculating EBITDA. We believe that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. Additionally, restrictive covenants in our long-term debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest and preferred dividends.
     FFO, FAD and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes. Additionally, FFO and FAD are internal evaluation metrics utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. FFO, FAD and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as
 
determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, FFO, FAD and EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.
     The table below reflects the reconciliation of FFO to net income available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented. The provision for depreciation includes provision for depreciation from discontinued operations. Amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

Critical Accounting Policies
     Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:
     Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. However, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Please refer to Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us. There have been no
 
material changes to these policies in 2004, except for the new policy regarding the fair value of derivative instruments.
     We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. Because Statement 123(R) must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date of Statement 123(R), and because we adopted Statement 123 using the prospective transition method (which applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date of Statement 123), compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123 will be recognized under Statement 123(R). However, had we adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements. We do not expect the adoption of Statement 123(R) to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
     The following table presents information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:
 
Impact of Inflation
     During the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. Additionally, our earnings are primarily long-term investments with fixed rates of return. These investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our lines of credit arrangements. During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing.
 
Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
     The Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include those regarding:
     For example, when we use words such as "may," "will," "intend," "should," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate" or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited to:
 
     
Risk factors related to our operators' revenues and expenses
     Our skilled nursing and specialty care facility operators' revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and private pay rates. Our assisted living facility operators' revenues are primarily driven by occupancy and private pay rates. Expenses for these three types of facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue, to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in a facility not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon.
     
Risk factors related to operator bankruptcies
     We are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, which may result in an operator bankruptcy or insolvency, or that an operator might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us the right to evict an operator, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our mortgage loans provide us the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An operator in bankruptcy may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a mortgage loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies.
     We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of a facility, avoid the imposition of liens on a facility and/or transition a facility to a new operator. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with an operator and relet the facility to another operator. In some of those situations, we provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new operator. If we cannot transition a leased facility to a new operator, we may take possession of that facility, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. See "Item 3  Legal Proceedings" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 .
     
Risk factors related to government regulations
     Our operators' businesses are affected by government reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that any skilled nursing or specialty care facility receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such facility. In recent years, governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures. Changes in health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of the skilled nursing industry, the specialty care industry or the health care industry in general. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for services provided by any facility operator, whether the facility receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an operator's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us. In addition, the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. See "Item 1  Business  Certain Government Regulations  Reimbursement" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
Risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs
     Long-term care facility operators (assisted living and skilled nursing facilities) have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims in recent years, particularly in the states of Texas and Florida. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased and may continue to increase. Nationwide, long-term care liability insurance rates are increasing because of large jury awards in states like Texas and Florida. Over the past two years, both Texas and Florida have adopted skilled nursing facility liability laws that modify or limit tort damages. Despite some of these reforms, the long-term care industry overall continues to experience very high general and professional liability costs. Insurance companies have responded to this claims crisis by severely restricting their capacity to write long-term care general and professional liability policies. No assurances can be given that the climate for long-term care general and professional liability insurance will improve in any of the foregoing states or any other states where the facility operators conduct business. Insurance companies may continue to reduce or stop writing general and professional liability policies for assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. Thus, general professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the facility operators' future operations, cash flows and financial condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the facility operators' ability to meet their obligations to us.
Risk factors related to acquisitions
     We are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities, and newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project or we could lose the property. Moreover, if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt, or both, to finance future acquisitions, it may reduce our per share financial results. These costs may negatively affect our results of operations.
Risk factors related to environmental laws
     Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination. These laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the person's relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property and since we are a passive landlord, we do not "participate in the management" of any property in which we have an interest. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the "all appropriate inquiry" standard, which qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
Risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds
     From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties, including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements. We must re-invest these proceeds, on a timely basis, in health care investments or in qualified short-term investments. We compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors. This competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us. Delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders.
 
Risk factors related to our structure
     We are also subject to a number of risks on the corporate level. First, we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. Also, if we were not a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends to stockholders amounting to at least 90% of its annual taxable income. See "Item 1  Business  Taxation" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 for a discussion of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that apply to us and the effects of non-qualification.
     Second, our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions (staggered board provisions, restrictions on share ownership and transfer, and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.
     Third, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more than one would have a material adverse impact on our business.
 
      
Item 8.
 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Stockholders and Directors Health Care REIT, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Health Care REIT, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in Item 15(a)(2) of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Health Care REIT, Inc. at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2003 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Health Care REIT, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2005 (not provided herein) expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1. Accounting Policies and Related Matters
Industry
     We are a self-administered, equity real estate investment trust that invests primarily in long-term care facilities, which include skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. We also invest in specialty care facilities.
Principles of Consolidation
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries after the elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
Use of Estimates
     The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
     Cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
Loans Receivable
     Loans receivable consist of mortgage loans, construction loans, working capital loans and subdebt investments. Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectibility risks. The mortgage loans are primarily collateralized by a first or second mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage on or assignment of partnership interest in the related facilities. Working capital loans are loans made to operators of facilities and are typically either secured and/or guaranteed. Subdebt investments represent debt instruments to operators of facilities that have been financed by us. These obligations are generally secured by the operator's leasehold rights and corporate guaranties.
Real Property Owned
     The cost of our real property is allocated to land, buildings, improvements and intangibles in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations. The allocation of the acquisition costs of properties is based on appraisals commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms. Substantially all of the properties owned by us are leased under operating leases and are recorded at cost. These properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from 15 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for improvements. The net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that the depreciable life may need to be changed. We consider external factors relating to each asset. If these external factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of the asset over the remaining depreciation period indicate that the asset will not be recoverable, the carrying value will be adjusted to the estimated fair market value. The leases generally extend for a minimum seven-year period and provide for payment of all taxes, insurance and maintenance by the tenants. Prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period subject to an evaluation of collectibility risks. This income is greater than the amount of cash received during the first half of the lease term. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for
 
the period. We recognized $922,500 of contingent rental income for the year ended December 31, 2004. We did not recognize any contingent rental income for the years ended December 31, 2002 or 2003.
Capitalization of Construction Period Interest
     We capitalize interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the balance outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest which approximates our cost of financing.
     We capitalized interest costs of $875,000, $1,535,000, and $170,000, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to construction of real property owned by us. Our interest expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income has been reduced by the amounts capitalized.
Deferred Loan Expenses
     Deferred loan expenses are costs incurred by us in connection with the issuance and amendments of short-term and long-term debt. We amortize these costs over the term of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the interest yield method.
Allowance for Loan Losses
     The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The determination of the allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of these loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectibility of loan payments. We evaluate the collectibility of our loans receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of the underlying property. If such factors indicate that there is greater risk of loan charge-offs, additional allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. At December 31, 2004, we had loans with outstanding balances of $35,918,000 on non-accrual status ($30,523,000 at December 31, 2003). To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectibility is diminished, we will return these loans to full accrual status. While a loan is on non-accrual status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding balance.
Equity Investments
     We had an investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P., a property group that specializes in the financing, through sale and leaseback transactions, of nursing and care homes located in the United Kingdom. This investment was accounted for using the equity method of accounting because we had the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee due to our 31% ownership interest. In October 2003, we sold our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P. generating a net gain of $902,000.
     Other equity investments, which consist of investments in private and public companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method of accounting, investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, distributions of earnings and additional investments. For investments in public companies that have readily determinable fair market values, we classify our equity investments as available-for-sale and, accordingly, record these investments at their fair market values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity. These investments represent a minimal ownership interest in these companies.
 
Foreign Currency Translation
     For fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the functional currency of our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P. was the local currency. The income and expenses of the entity were translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the reporting period to derive our equity earnings. Translation adjustments were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity. As noted above, we sold this investment in October 2003.
Transaction Fees
     Transaction fees are earned by us for our agreement to provide direct and standby financing to, and credit enhancement for, owners and operators of health care facilities. We amortize transaction fees over the initial fixed term of the lease, the loan or the construction period related to such investments.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
     Accumulated other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains or losses on our equity investments and foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated unrealized gains and losses totaled $1,000, $1,000 and $12,000 at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Due to the sale of our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P. in October 2003, accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments totaled $0, $0 and ($182,000) at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These items are included as components of stockholders' equity.
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
     We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings, but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates.
     In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, which amends Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Statement No. 133, as amended, requires companies to record derivatives at fair market value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities.
     On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements (the "Swaps") for a total notional amount of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement No. 133, as amended. The Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2004, the Swaps were reported at their fair value as a $4,206,000 other asset. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we generated $1,770,000 of savings related to the Swaps that was recorded as a reduction in interest expense. We had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2003 or 2002.
     The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are estimated by a third party consultant, which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future.
 
Net Income Per Share
     Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period adjusted for non-vested shares of restricted stock. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.
Federal Income Tax
     No provision has been made for federal income taxes since we have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and we believe that we have met the requirements for qualification as such for each taxable year. See Note 11.
New Accounting Standards
     In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (the "Interpretation"). The Interpretation requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Previously, entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise that had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. We have performed a quantitative analysis for certain variable interests in our operators and determined that none of the operators' businesses are variable interest entities because the fair value of the equity of these businesses exceeds the expected losses as calculated. In addition to our quantitative analysis, our evaluation also included an analysis of aspects of our operators' businesses, such as involvement in the day to day decision making of the operators' businesses, ownership or voting rights in any of these businesses and participation in the profits or losses of such businesses, to further determine the absence of a controlling financial interest in the context of the Interpretation.
     We adopted the fair value-based method of accounting for share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. Currently, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants and expect to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model upon the required adoption of Statement 123(R) on July 1, 2005. Because Statement 123(R) must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date of Statement 123(R), and because we adopted Statement 123 using the prospective transition method (which applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date of Statement 123), compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under Statement 123 will be recognized under Statement 123(R). However, had we adopted Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 9. We do not expect the adoption of Statement 123(R) to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 
2. Loans Receivable
     The following is a summary of loans receivable (in thousands):
     Loans to related parties (an entity whose ownership includes one Company director) included above are at rates comparable to other third-party borrowers equal to or greater than our net interest cost on borrowings to support such loans. The amount of interest income and commitment fees from related parties amounted to $682,000, $36,000, and $59,000 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     The following is a summary of mortgage loans at December 31, 2004:
 
3. Real Property Owned
     The following table summarizes certain information about our real property owned as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
     At December 31, 2004, future minimum lease payments receivable under operating leases are as follows (in thousands):
     We purchased $8,500,000, $12,433,000 and $33,972,000 of real property that had previously been financed by the Company with loans in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We converted $36,794,000 of completed construction projects into operating lease properties in 2003. We acquired properties which included the assumption of mortgages totaling $14,555,000, $101,243,000 and $2,248,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These non-cash activities are appropriately not reflected in the accompanying statements of cash flows.
     During the year ended December 31, 2004, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of $314,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value. The estimated fair market value was determined by an offer to purchase received from a third party. During the year ended December 31, 2003, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of $2,792,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value. The estimated fair market value of the property was determined by an independent appraisal. During the year ended December 31, 2002, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from three properties did not exceed their related net book values and impairment charges of $2,298,000 were recorded to reduce the properties to their estimated fair market values. The estimated fair market values of the properties were determined by offers to purchase received from third parties or estimated net sales proceeds.
4. Concentration of Risk
     As of December 31, 2004, long-term care facilities, which include skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, comprised 93% (92% at December 31, 2003) of our real estate investments and were located in 35 states. Investments in assisted living facilities comprised 54% (60% at December 31, 2003) of our real estate investments. The following table summarizes certain information about our operator concentration as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands):

     The following is a summary of our loan impairments (in thousands):
6. Borrowings Under Lines of Credit Arrangements and Related Items
     We have an unsecured credit arrangement with a consortium of eight banks providing for a revolving line of credit ("revolving credit") in the amount of $310,000,000, which expires on May 15, 2006. The agreement specifies that borrowings under the revolving credit are subject to interest payable in periods no longer than three months at either the agent bank's prime rate of interest or 1.3% over LIBOR interest rate, at our option (3.7375% at December 31, 2004). In addition, we pay a commitment fee based on an annual rate of 0.325% and an annual agent's fee of $50,000. Principal is due upon expiration of the agreement. We have another
 
unsecured line of credit arrangement with a consortium of three banks for a total of $30,000,000, which expires May 31, 2005. Borrowings under this line of credit are subject to interest at either the lead bank's prime rate of interest or 2.00% over LIBOR interest rate, at our option (5.25% at December 31, 2004) and are due on demand.
     The following information relates to aggregate borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements (in thousands, except percentages):
7. Senior Unsecured Notes and Secured Debt
     We have $875,000,000 of senior unsecured notes with annual interest rates ranging from 6.00% to 8.17%.
     We have 32 mortgage loans totaling $160,225,000, collateralized by health care facilities with annual interest rates ranging from 5.50% to 12.00%. The carrying values of the health care properties securing the mortgage loans totaled $233,591,000 at December 31, 2004.
     Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions.
     At December 31, 2004, the annual principal payments on these long-term obligations are as follows (in thousands):
8. Stock Incentive Plans
     Our 1995 Stock Incentive Plan authorizes up to 3,768,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The 1995 Plan replaced the 1985 Incentive Stock Option Plan. The options granted under the 1985 Plan continue to vest through 2005 and expire ten years from the date of grant. Our officers and key salaried employees are eligible to participate in the 1995 Plan. The 1995 Plan allows for the issuance of, among other things, stock options, restricted stock grants and dividend equivalent rights.
 
There were no dividend equivalent rights outstanding under the 1995 Plan for 2003 or 2002. In addition, we have a Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which authorizes up to 480,000 shares to be issued.
     The following summarizes the activity in the plans for the years ended December 31 (shares in thousands):
     Vesting periods for options and restricted shares range from six months for directors to five years for officers and key salaried employees. Options expire ten years from the date of grant. We granted 112,000, 110,000, and 8,000 restricted shares during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including 10,000, 12,000, and 8,000 shares for directors in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Expense, which is recognized as the shares vest based on the market value at the date of the award, totaled $2,887,000, $2,157,000 and $1,555,000, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2004 (shares in thousands):
9. Other Equity
     Other equity consists of the following (in thousands):
 
     Unamortized restricted stock represents the unamortized value of restricted stock granted to employees and directors prior to January 1, 2003. Expense related to these grants, which is recognized as the shares vest based on the market value at the date of the award, totaled $949,000, $1,182,000 and $1,555,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, which we are required to adopt for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002, with transition provisions for certain matters. Statement 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, Statement 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we commenced recognizing compensation expense in accordance with Statement 123 on a prospective basis. Accumulated compensation expense related to stock options represents the amount of amortized compensation costs related to stock options awarded to employees and directors subsequent to January 1, 2003.
     The following table illustrates the effect on net income available to common stockholders if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement 123 to stock-based compensation for options granted since 1995 but prior to adoption at January 1, 2003 (in thousands, except per share data):
 
     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
10. Preferred Stock
     In July 2003, we closed a public offering of 4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date, on or after July 9, 2008. A portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all 3,000,000 shares of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on July 15, 2003, at a redemption price of $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, the costs to issue the Series B Preferred Stock were recorded as a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2,790,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2003 to reduce net income available to common stockholders.
     In September 2003, we issued 1,060,000 shares of 6% Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock as partial consideration for an acquisition of assets by the Company, with the shares valued at $26,500,000 for such purposes. The shares were issued to Southern Assisted Living, Inc. and certain of its stockholders without registration in reliance upon the federal statutory exemption of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The shares have a liquidation value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date, on or after August 15, 2008. The preferred shares are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $32.66 per share at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2004, certain holders of our Series E Preferred Stock converted 480,399 shares into 367,724 shares of our common stock, leaving 350,045 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2004.
     In September 2004, we closed a public offering of 7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. These shares have a liquidation value of $25.00 per share. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. The preferred stock, which has no stated maturity, may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date, on or after September 14, 2009.
11. Income Taxes and Distributions
     To qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, 90% of taxable income (including 100% of capital gains) must be distributed to stockholders. Real estate investment trusts that do not distribute a certain amount of current year taxable income in the current year are also subject to a 4% federal excise tax. The principal reasons for the difference between undistributed net income for federal income tax purposes and financial statement purposes are the recognition of straight-line rent for reporting
 
purposes, different useful lives and depreciation methods for real property and the provision for loan losses for reporting purposes versus bad debt expense for tax purposes. Cash distributions paid to common stockholders, for federal income tax purposes, are as follows:
12. Commitments and Contingencies
     We have guaranteed the payment of industrial revenue bonds for one assisted living facility, in the event that the present owner defaults upon its obligations. In consideration for this guaranty, we receive and recognize fees annually related to this arrangement. This guaranty expires upon the repayment of the industrial revenue bonds which currently mature in 2009. At December 31, 2004, we were contingently liable for $3,195,000 under this guaranty.
     We have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit of certain insurance companies that provide workers' compensation insurance to one of our tenants. Our obligation under the letter of credit matures in 2009. At December 31, 2004, our obligation under the letter of credit was $2,450,000.
     At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding construction financings of $26,183,000 ($25,463,000 for leased properties and $720,000 for construction loans) and were committed to providing additional financing of approximately $3,833,000 to complete construction. At December 31, 2004, we had contingent purchase obligations totaling $82,815,000. These contingent purchase obligations primarily relate to deferred acquisition fundings. Deferred acquisition fundings are contingent upon an operator satisfying certain conditions such as payment coverage and value tests. Amounts due from the tenant are increased to reflect the additional investment in the property.
     At December 31, 2004, we had operating lease obligations of $16,036,000 relating to Company office space, six assisted living facilities and three skilled nursing facilities. We incurred rental expense relating to our Company office space of $292,000, $348,000 and $213,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Regarding the facility leases, we have sublease agreements with certain of our operators that require the operators to reimburse us for our monthly operating lease obligations. At December 31, 2004, aggregate future minimum rentals to be received under these noncancelable subleases totaled $14,509,000. At December 31, 2004, future minimum lease payments due under operating leases are as follows (in thousands):
 
13. Earnings Per Share
     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):
     The diluted earnings per share calculation excludes the dilutive effect of 112,000, 0 and 10,000 options for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, because the exercise price was greater than the average market price. The Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock was not included in the calculations for 2002 and 2003 as the effect of the conversions was anti-dilutive. The Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock was not included in the calculations for 2003 and 2004 as the effect of the conversions was anti-dilutive.
14. Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
      The fair value of all mortgage loans receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.
Mortgage Loans Receivable
      The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the interest rates received, which approximates current market rates.
Working Capital Loans, Construction Loans and Subdebt Investments
      The carrying amount approximates fair value.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
      Equity investments are recorded at their fair market value.
Equity Investments
      The carrying amount of the lines of credit arrangements approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate adjustable.
Borrowings Under Lines of Credit Arrangements
      The fair value of the senior unsecured notes payable was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current borrowing rate available to the Company for similar debt.
Senior Unsecured Notes
 
      Mortgage loans payable is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the interest rates paid, which approximates current market rates.
Mortgage Loans Payable
      Our interest rate swap agreements are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair market value. Fair market value is estimated by a third party consultant, which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements
     The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments are as follows (in thousands):
15. Discontinued Operations
     In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2002 and have reflected the results of properties disposed of through September 30, 2005 in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
     During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, we sold properties with carrying values of $53,311,000, $61,316,000 and $37,710,000 for net losses of $1,032,000, net gains of $4,139,000 and net losses of $143,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, we sold properties with carrying values of $10,034,000 for a net loss of $134,000. Also, at September 30, 2005, six properties were classified as held for sale. In accordance with Statement No. 144, we have reclassified the income and expenses attributable to these properties to discontinued operations. Expenses include an allocation of interest expense based on property carrying values and our weighted average cost of debt. The following illustrates the reclassification impact of Statement No. 144 as a result of classifying the properties as discontinued operations (in thousands):
 
16. Retirement Arrangements
     We have a Retirement Plan and Trust (the "401(k) Plan") covering all eligible employees. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible employees may make contributions, and we may make matching contributions and a profit sharing contribution. Our contributions to this 401(k) Plan totaled $289,000, $206,000 and $184,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     We have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"), a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan, which provides certain executive officers with supplemental deferred retirement benefits. The SERP provides an opportunity for participants to receive retirement benefits that cannot be paid under our tax-qualified Plan because of the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Benefits are based on compensation and length of service and the SERP is unfunded. No company contributions are anticipated for the 2005 fiscal year. No benefit payments are expected to occur during the next five fiscal years and total $470,000 during the succeeding five fiscal years. We use a December 31 measurement date for the SERP. The accrued liability on our balance sheet for the SERP was $703,000 at December 31, 2004 ($412,000 at December 31, 2003).
     The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the SERP's benefit obligations and fair value, and a statement of the funded status for the periods indicated (in thousands):
     The following table shows the components of net periodic benefit costs for the periods indicated (in thousands):
 
     The following table provides information for the SERP which has an accumulated benefit in excess of plan assets (in thousands):
     The following table reflects the weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for the SERP:
