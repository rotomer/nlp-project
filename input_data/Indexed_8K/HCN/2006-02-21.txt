ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
Effective October 23, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") adopted new rules related to insider trading. One of these rules, Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), provides an exemption to the insider trading rules in the form of an affirmative defense. Rule 10b5-1 recognizes the creation of formal programs under which executives and other insiders may sell the securities of publicly traded companies on a regular basis pursuant to written plans that are entered into at a time when the plan participants are not aware of material non-public information and that otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1.
On January 28, 2003, the Board of Directors of Health Care REIT, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a resolution modifying its insider trading policy to allow insiders to sell securities of the Company pursuant to pre-arranged trading plans.
On February 15, 2006, Raymond W. Braun, President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, entered into a new plan pursuant to which he instructed his broker to exercise options and sell up to 50,656 shares of the Company's common stock during the period between the last trading day of February 2006 and the day before the last trading day of December 2006. The number of shares to be exercised and sold under Mr. Braun's plan ranges from 10,000 to 2,950 shares per month, not including any unsold shares that might be carried over from a previous month. Any shares that remain unsold at the end of the ten month period described above may be exercised and sold through the last trading day of April 2007.
Reports of the details of actual sales under the plan will be filed by Mr. Braun on Form 4 in accordance with SEC regulations.
