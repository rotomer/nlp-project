Toledo, Ohio, May 4, 2006........announced today operating results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2006.
Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN)

"Driven by these recent portfolio improvements, our strong acquisition pipeline and new development initiative, we expect continued dividend growth and solid portfolio payment coverages."
Key Performance Indicators
.
The first quarter 2006 reported net income available to common stockholders of $0.34 per diluted share includes $1.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of non-cash expenses for required accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock grants pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), which was adopted on January 1, 2006. In addition, net income was positively impacted by $1.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of gains on sales of real property. FAD for first quarter 2006 was higher than FFO by $7.9 million ($0.14 per diluted share) due to non-recurring cash rental receipts of $10.3 million ($0.18 per diluted share) offset by gross straight-line rental income of $2.4 million ($0.04 per diluted share). Non-recurring cash receipts are primarily attributable to cash received in connection with prepaid rent receipts and real property sales resulting in the payoff of existing straight-line receivable balances. Please see Exhibits 13 and 14 for reconciliations of net income available to common stockholders to FAD and FFO. The following table summarizes the items impacting FFO and FAD:

As previously announced, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 of $0.64 per share as compared to $0.62 per share for the same period in 2005. The dividend represents the 140 consecutive dividend payment. The dividend will be payable May 19, 2006 to stockholders of record on April 28, 2006.
Dividends for First Quarter 2006
.
th
As previously announced, the company has undertaken a new development initiative and expects to fund $150 to $250 million for development during 2006. The company completed a successful start to its development program during the first quarter and has provided details of existing projects in Exhibit 8. The company expects to fund $130.6 million for development during 2006 on projects which are already underway, with an additional $20 to $120 million anticipated from projects which have yet to commence. The $130.6 million of anticipated funding from existing projects is comprised of $32.2 million which was funded during the three months ended March 31, 2006 and $98.4 million projected to be funded over the remainder of 2006. The information contained in Exhibit 8 relates only to development projects for which initial funding has commenced as of March 31, 2006 and does not include any additional development projects which may commence later in 2006.
Development Initiative
.
The company affirms its investment guidance of $450 to $550 million for 2006, which is comprised of $300 million of acquisitions and $150 to $250 million of funded new development. In addition, the company expects $100 to $150 million of dispositions, resulting in net investments of $300 to $450 million. Due in part to the first quarter gains on sales of properties of $1.6 million, the company is increasing its 2006 guidance for net income available to common stockholders from a range of $1.28 to $1.36 per diluted share to $1.33 to $1.41 per diluted share. The company is reaffirming its 2006 FFO guidance in the range of $2.88 to $2.96 per diluted share. The company is increasing its 2006 FAD guidance from a range of $2.77 to $2.85 per diluted share to $2.91 to $2.99 per diluted share primarily due to the non-recurring cash receipts of $10.3 million offset by a $1.3 million increase in our gross straight-line rental income estimate and a 1.0 million share increase in our estimate of average diluted common shares outstanding.
Outlook for 2006
.
The company's guidance excludes any impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional one-time items, including any additional cash payments outside the normal monthly rental payments. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to FFO and FAD.
The company believes that net income, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FAD represents FFO excluding the non-cash straight-line rental adjustments.
Supplemental Reporting Measures
.
Page 2 of 15
 
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The company believes that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of its operations. Additionally, restrictive covenants in the company's long-term debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. The company primarily utilizes EBITDA to measure its interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense and its fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and preferred stock dividends.
FFO, FAD and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, FFO and FAD are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. FFO, FAD and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, FFO, FAD and EBITDA, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 12, 13 and 14 for reconciliations of EBITDA, FAD and FFO to net income.
