company expects $100 to $150 million of dispositions, resulting in net investments of $375 to $500 million. Due primarily to the second quarter gains on sales of properties of $1.0 million, the company is increasing its 2006 guidance for net income available to common stockholders from a range of $1.33 to $1.41 per diluted share to $1.34 to $1.42 per diluted share.

The company is increasing its 2006 FAD guidance from a range of $2.91 to $2.99 per diluted share to $2.95 to $3.03 per diluted share primarily due to the cash receipts of $2.7 million during the second quarter of 2006.
The company's guidance excludes any impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional one-time items, including any additional cash payments outside the normal monthly rental payments. Please see Exhibit 15 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to FFO and FAD.

Conference Call Information
.
The company believes that net income, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FAD represents FFO excluding the net straight-line rental adjustments.
Supplemental Reporting Measures
.
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The company believes that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of its operations. Additionally, restrictive covenants in the company's long-term debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. The company primarily utilizes EBITDA to measure its interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by interest expense, and its fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and preferred stock dividends.
In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 145 that requires gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under Statement No. 4. The company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2003 and has properly reflected the prior year loss on extinguishment of debt which may not be added back to net income in the calculation of FFO, FAD or EBITDA. Although the company has adopted this treatment, it has also disclosed FFO, FAD and EBITDA adjusted for the loss on extinguishment of debt for enhanced clarity.
FFO, FAD and EBITDA are financial measures that are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, FFO and FAD are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. FFO, FAD and EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, FFO, FAD and EBITDA, as

defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see Exhibits 12, 13 and 14 for reconciliations of EBITDA, FAD and FFO to net income.
