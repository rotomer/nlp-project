Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 20, 2006, Health Care REIT, Inc. (the "Company") and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the $700,000,000 unsecured line of credit arrangement with a consortium of 12 banks, KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as syndication agent, and UBS Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as documentation agents, to modify the Company's covenant regarding mergers and acquisitions. Under the amendment, a merger or acquisition will require the approval or consent of the administrative agent and the banks only if the approval of the Company's stockholders is required under New York Stock Exchange rules. The loan agreement previously required such approval or consent if the consideration paid in connection with a merger or acquisition exceeded 20 percent of the Company's consolidated total assets.
The foregoing description does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the amendment. The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to Amendment No. 1 to Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement by and among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, the banks signatory thereto, KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as syndication agent, and UBS Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as documentation agents, dated as of September 20, 2006, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report.
