Other Events.
Effective October 23, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") adopted new rules related to insider trading. One of these rules, Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provides an exemption to the insider trading rules in the form of an affirmative defense. Rule 10b5-1 recognizes the creation of formal programs under which executives and other insiders may sell the securities of publicly traded companies on a regular basis pursuant to written plans that are entered into at a time when the plan participants are not aware of material non-public information and that otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1.
On January 28, 2003, the Board of Directors of Health Care REIT, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a resolution modifying its insider trading policy to allow insiders to sell securities of the Company pursuant to pre-arranged trading plans.
On March 12, 2007, Raymond W. Braun, President of the Company, entered into a new plan pursuant to which he instructed his broker to sell up to 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock and exercise options and sell up to 35,420 shares of the Company's common stock during the period between March 15, 2007 and January 31, 2008. The number of shares to be sold under Mr. Braun's plan ranges from 5,000 to 5,053 shares per month, not including any unsold shares that might be carried over from a previous month.
Reports of the details of actual sales under the plan will be filed by Mr. Braun on Form 4 in accordance with SEC regulations.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant had duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
