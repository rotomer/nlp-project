Item 2.03
Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On July 16, 2007, pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-134082) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 12, 2006, Health Care REIT, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement with UBS Securities LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC for an offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the "Notes"). The Notes were issued under an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), dated as of November 20, 2006, as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 2 between the Company and the Trustee, dated as of July 20, 2007.
The Notes pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 4.75% per year and mature on July 15, 2027. The Notes are convertible, in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.0000 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $50.00 per share. In general, upon conversion, the holder of each Note would receive, in respect of the conversion value of such Note, cash up to the principal amount of such Note and the Company's common stock for the Note's conversion value in excess of such principal amount.
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are effectively subordinated to all of the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.

In addition, solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, the Company proposes to grant to the Underwriters the option to purchase from the Company up to $60,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes (the "Option Notes") as set forth below.

     As the Representatives, you have advised the Company (a) that you are authorized to enter into this Agreement and (b) that the Underwriters are willing to purchase, acting severally and not jointly, the Firm Notes set forth in Schedule I hereto, plus such Option Notes if the Underwriters elect to exercise the over-allotment option in whole or in part for the account of the Underwriters. The Firm Notes and the Option Notes (to the extent such option is exercised) are herein collectively sometimes referred to as the "Notes."

     (xii) The financial statements of the Company, together with related notes and schedules, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, present fairly the financial position and the results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the indicated dates and for the indicated periods. Such financial statements and the related notes and schedules have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied throughout the periods involved, and all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results for such periods have been made. The summary financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus present fairly the information shown therein and, to the extent based upon or derived from the financial statements, have been compiled on a basis consistent with the financial statements presented therein.

     (xiii) There is no action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened (a) against the Company or its Subsidiaries or (b) involving any property of the Company or its Subsidiaries before any court or administrative agency which, if determined adversely to the Company or its Subsidiaries, might reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
     (xiv) The Company, together with its Subsidiaries, has good and marketable title to all of the properties and assets reflected in the financial statements hereinabove described (or as described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as owned by it), subject to no lien, mortgage, pledge, charge or encumbrance of any kind except those reflected in such financial statements (or as described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus) or which are not material in amount or which do
 
not interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of the property. The leases, agreements to purchase and mortgages to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the guaranties of third parties (a) are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, of all other parties thereto, and the Company knows of no default or defenses currently existing with respect thereto which might reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect, and (b) conform to the descriptions thereof set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. Each mortgage which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds on the properties described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus constitutes a valid mortgage lien for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, on such property.
     (xv) The Company has filed all Federal, state and foreign income tax returns which have been required to be filed and has paid all taxes indicated by said returns and all assessments received by it to the extent that such taxes have become due and are not being contested in good faith.

The Company has no material contingent obligations which are not disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
     (xvii) The Company is not in violation of its charter or by-laws. No Subsidiary is in violation of its charter or by-laws, which violation will have, or after any required notice and passage of any applicable grace period would have, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are (a) in default under any agreement, lease, contract, indenture or other instrument or obligation to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties is bound, (b) in violation of any statute, or (c) in violation of any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its properties, of any court or of any regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body, any of which defaults or violations described in clauses (a) through (c) will have, or after any required notice and passage of any applicable grace period would have, a Material Adverse Effect. The issue and sale of the Notes and the performance by the Company of all of its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated and the fulfillment of the terms hereof and thereof will not after any required notice and passage of any applicable grace period conflict with or constitute a violation of any statute or conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, constitute a default under or result in the imposition of any lien pursuant to, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other agreement or instrument to which the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, or a violation of its charter or by-laws or any order, rule
 
or regulation applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its properties of any court or of any regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body.
     (xviii) Each approval, consent, order, authorization, designation, declaration or filing by or with any regulatory, administrative or other governmental body necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Indenture (except such additional steps as may be required by the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") or may be necessary to qualify the Notes for public offering by the Underwriters under state securities or Blue Sky laws) has been obtained or made by the Company, and is in full force and effect.
     (xix) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates and permits from governmental authorities which are necessary to the conduct of their businesses and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have received any notice of infringement or of conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any patents, patent rights, trade names, trademarks or copyrights, which infringement is material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
     (xx) The Company qualifies as a real estate investment trust pursuant to Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, has so qualified for the taxable years ended December 31, 1984 through December 31, 2006 and no transaction or other event has occurred or is contemplated which would prevent the Company from so qualifying for its current taxable year.

     (xxiii) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to perform the functions for which they were established; the Company's auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company have been advised of: (a) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data; and (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a role in
 
the Company's internal controls; any material weaknesses in internal controls have been identified for the Company's auditors; and since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
     (xxiv) Since July 30, 2002, the Company has not, directly or indirectly, including through any subsidiary: (a) extended credit, arranged to extend credit, or renewed any extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan, to or for any director or executive officer of the Company, or to or for any family member or affiliate of any director or executive officer of the Company; or (b) made any material modification, including any renewal thereof, to any term of any personal loan to any director or executive officer of the Company, or any family member or affiliate of any director or executive officer, which loan was outstanding on July 30, 2002.

     (xxvi) This Agreement and the Indenture have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     (xxvii) Neither the Company nor any of its officers or directors has taken nor will any of them take, directly or indirectly, any action resulting in a violation of Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act, or designed to cause or result in, or which has constituted or which reasonably might be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Notes or the Underlying Securities. The Company acknowledges that the Underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes or the Underlying Securities, including stabilizing bids, syndicate covering transactions and the imposition of penalty bids.

herein, "business day" means a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which banks in New York are open for business and not permitted by law or executive order to be closed). Payment for the Firm Notes to be sold hereunder is to be made by Federal Funds wire transfer to an account designated by the Company, against delivery of the Firm Notes to the Underwriters. The Firm Notes will be evidenced by a single definitive global certificate in book entry form, fully registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), or registered in such other names and in such denominations as the Representatives request in writing not later than the second full business day prior to the Closing Date. The single global certificate will be made available for inspection by the Representatives at least one business day prior to the Closing Date at such place as the Representatives, DTC and the Company shall agree.
          In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the Underwriters to purchase severally the Option Notes at the purchase price as set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 2. The option granted hereby may be exercised in whole or in part by giving notice (i) at any time before the Closing Date and (ii) only once thereafter within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, by the Representatives to the Company setting forth the principal amount of Option Notes as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and the time and date at which such Option Notes are to be delivered. The time and date at which the Option Notes are to be delivered shall be determined by the Representatives but shall not be earlier than three nor later than 10 full business days after the exercise of such option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Date (such time and date being herein referred to as the "Option Closing Date"). If the date of exercise of the option is three or more days before the Closing Date, the notice of exercise shall set the Closing Date as the Option Closing Date. The option with respect to the Option Notes granted hereunder may be exercised only to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Notes by the Underwriters. The Representatives may cancel such option at any time prior to its expiration by giving written notice of such cancellation to the Company. To the extent, if any, that the option is exercised, payment for the Option Notes shall be made by Federal Funds wire transfer to an account designated by the Company, against delivery of the Option Notes to the Underwriters. Such payment and delivery are to be made at the offices of UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. New York time, on the Option Closing Date.

The single global certificate will be made available for inspection by the Representatives at least one business day prior to the Option Closing Date at such place as the Representatives, DTC and the Company shall agree.
     It is understood that the several Underwriters are to make a public offering of the Notes as soon as the Representatives deem it advisable to do so.

The Representatives may from time to time thereafter change the public offering price and other selling terms.

     (xi) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as it is practicable to do so, but in any event not later than 15 months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement (which need not be audited) in reasonable detail, covering a period of twelve consecutive months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 under the Securities Act.

     (xv) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company will not take any action or authorize any action that would result in an adjustment of the conversion price of the Notes if the Notes had been issued on the date hereof; and
     (xvi) The Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, shares of Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligations to issue its Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes.
     The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and the Indenture, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: the fees incident to the preparation, issuance, execution, authentication and delivery of the Notes, including any expenses of the Trustee; the fees payable to rating agencies in connection with the rating of the Notes; accounting fees of the Company; the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; the cost of printing and delivering to, or as requested by, the Underwriters, copies of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectuses, the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, the Prospectus, this Agreement, the Indenture and any amendments or supplements thereto; the fees incident to the listing of the Notes on any securities exchange; the filing fees of the Commission; the filing fees and expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) incident to securing any required review by the NASD of the terms of the sale of the Notes; and the fees incident to the listing of the Underlying Securities on the New York Stock Exchange and the applicable listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange.

The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of the Underwriters' expenses except that, if this Agreement shall not be consummated because the conditions in Section 7 hereof are not satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Representatives pursuant to Section 6 hereof, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(i)(a) or Section 10(i)(h) hereof, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on its part to be performed, unless such failure to satisfy said condition or to comply with said
5. Costs and Expenses.

     The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Firm Notes on the Closing Date and the Option Notes, if any, on the Option Closing Date are subject to the accuracy, as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, of the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein, and to the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

Furthermore, such counsel shall opine that the statements contained under the headings "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" and "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the Commission on March 12, 2007, and any amendments thereto (and any similar sections or information contained in the General Disclosure Package) are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax treatment of the Company and of its stockholders.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters governed by the laws of states other than the laws of the State of Ohio, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware or Federal laws on local counsel in such jurisdictions, provided that in such case such counsel shall state that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying on such other counsel and such other counsel shall indicate that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion. As to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, such counsel may rely on certificates of officers of the Company and public officials so long as such counsel states that they have no reason to believe that either the Underwriters or they are not justified in relying on such certificates. In addition to the matters set forth above, the opinion of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP shall also include a statement to the effect that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which leads them to believe that (a) the Registration Statement, as of the time of its effectiveness for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act and as of the Applicable Time, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (c) the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, on the date it was filed pursuant to the Rules and Regulations and as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements, schedules and other financial information included therein). With respect to such statement, Shumaker,
 
Loop & Kendrick, LLP may state that this statement is based upon the procedures set forth or incorporated by reference therein, but is without independent check and verification.
     (iv) The Representatives shall have received, on the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, from (a) Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion dated the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, with respect to the organization of the Company, the validity of the Indenture and the Notes, the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and other related matters as the Representatives reasonably may request and (b) Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion dated the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, with respect to the validity of the Indenture and the Notes, and other related matters as the Representatives reasonably may request, and each such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.

     (vii) The Representatives shall have received on the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, a certificate or certificates of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that on and as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, each of them severally represents as follows:

     (d) He has carefully examined the General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus and, in his opinion, as of the Applicable Time, the statements contained in the General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, and such General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, did not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     (e) He has carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in his opinion, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, were true and correct, and such Registration Statement and Prospectus, or any document incorporated by reference therein, did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and, in his opinion, since the effective date of the Registration Statement, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Prospectus which has not been so set forth in such supplement or amendment.
     (f) The representations and warranties of the Company as set forth in this Agreement are true and correct as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, as if made on such date.

7. Conditions of the Obligations of the Company.
     
8. Indemnification.
     (i) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (b) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, or (c) any act or failure to act, or any alleged act or failure to act by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Notes or the offering contemplated hereby, and will reimburse each such Underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
 
statement, or omission or alleged omission made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (ii) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have.
     (iii) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing; provided that the failure to so notify will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that the indemnifying party may have on account of the provisions of Sections 8(i) or (ii) or otherwise, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall not have otherwise learned of such proceeding and such failure is materially prejudicial to the indemnifying party. In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event (a) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (b) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the
 
indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit notwithstanding its obligation to bear the fees and expenses of such counsel. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties and one local counsel. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(i) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(ii). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the fifth sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent to which the indemnification obligations of the Company hereunder are applicable if (a) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (b) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
     (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless to the extent required therein an indemnified party under Sections 8(i) or (ii) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters from the offering of the Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(iii) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Underwriters bear to the total proceeds of the offering (the proceeds received by the Underwriters being equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters), in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(iv) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(iv). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to
 
above in this Section 8(iv) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(iv), (a) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Notes purchased by such Underwriter and (b) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations under this Section 8(iv) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (v) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 8 hereby consents to the jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon him or it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join him or it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.
     All communications hereunder shall be in writing and, except as otherwise provided herein, will be mailed, delivered or telecopied and confirmed as follows: if to the Underwriters, to UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10171, or via fax at (212) 821-4610, Attention: Equity Capital Markets, with a copy to the General Counsel via fax at (212) 821-4042; if to the Company, to Health Care REIT, Inc., One SeaGate, Suite 1500, Toledo, Ohio 43603-1475, or via fax at (419) 247-2826, Attention: George L. Chapman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
9. Notices.
     This Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company as follows:
10. Termination.
     (i) at any time prior to the Closing Date or any Option Closing Date (if different from the Closing Date and then only as to the Option Notes) if any of the following has occurred: (a) since the date hereof, any adverse change or any development involving a prospective adverse change in or affecting the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company or the earnings, business affairs, management or business prospects of the Company, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, that, in your judgment, is material so as to make the offering or delivery of the Notes impracticable or inadvisable, (b) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or declaration of war or national emergency after the date hereof or other national or international calamity or crisis or change in economic or political conditions if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, emergency, calamity, crisis or change on the financial markets of the United States would, in your judgment, make the offering or delivery of the Notes impracticable or inadvisable, (c) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, or in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange, shall have been suspended or materially limited (other than limitations on hours or numbers of days of trading) or minimum prices shall have been established for securities on any such exchange, (d) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which in your reasonable opinion materially and adversely affects or will materially or adversely affect the business or operations of the Company, (e) declaration of a banking moratorium by either federal or New York State authorities or material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, (f) the taking of any action by any federal, state or local government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in your reasonable opinion has a material adverse effect on the securities markets in the United States, (g) any litigation or proceeding is
 
pending or threatened against any Underwriter which seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain, or seeks damages in connection with, or questions the legality or validity of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (h) any downgrading, or the giving of any notice of (1) any intended or potential downgrading or (2) any review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating, if any, accorded to any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; or
     (ii) as provided in Sections 6 and 11 of this Agreement.
     If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date (except in the event of a default on the part of the Company), and the aggregate principal amount of Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is ten percent or less of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives for the purchase of such Notes by other persons (who may include one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, including the Representatives), but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default (except in the event of a default on the part of the Company) occurs is more than ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing or the Option Closing, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 11. Any action taken under this Section 11 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
11. Default by Underwriters.
     This Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors, executors, administrators, heirs and assigns, and the officers, directors and controlling persons referred to herein, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. The term "successors" shall not include any purchaser of the Notes merely because of such purchase.
12. Successors.
     The Company and the Underwriters acknowledge and agree that the only information furnished or to be furnished by the Underwriters to the Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus consists of the information set forth in the third and tenth through sixteenth paragraphs (provided that, with respect to such sixteenth paragraph, only the Underwriter that maintains a website through which information relating to the sale of the Notes is provided shall be deemed to have provided information through such website for purposes of this Section 13 and the
13. Information Provided by Underwriters.
 
information so provided shall be deemed to include only the information contained in such website other than the Prospectus) under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.
     The reimbursement, indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Agreement and the representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person thereof, or by or on behalf of the Company or its directors or officers and (iii) delivery of and payment for the Notes under this Agreement.
14. Miscellaneous.
          The Company hereby acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is acting solely as an underwriter in connection with the purchase and sale of the Company's securities. The Company further acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm's length basis and in no event do the parties intend that any Underwriter act or be responsible as a fiduciary to the Company, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that any Underwriter may undertake or has undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Company's securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Underwriters hereby expressly disclaim any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Company, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect. The Company and the Underwriters agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions, and that any opinions or views expressed by the Underwriters to the Company regarding such transactions, including but not limited to any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Company's securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Company. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions.
          This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
          This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Company and the Underwriters each submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York located in the City and County of New York and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any action or dispute in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each of the Company (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates) and the Underwriters waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
 
          If the foregoing letter is in accordance with your understanding of our agreement, please sign and return to us the enclosed duplicates hereof, whereupon it will become a binding agreement among the Company and the Underwriters in accordance with its terms.

The following table sets forth the number of additional shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes that will be added to the conversion rate applicable to Notes that are converted during the make-whole conversion period. The Applicable Prices set forth in the first column of the table below, and the number of additional shares, are subject to adjustment as described in the preliminary prospectus supplement for the Notes.
Make-Whole Table
If the Applicable Price is between two Applicable Prices in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of additional shares will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of additional shares set forth for the two Applicable Prices, or for the two Effective Dates based on a 365-day year, as applicable. In addition, if the actual Applicable Price is greater than $120.00 per share (subject to adjustment), the conversion rate will not be increased in connection with that make-whole fundamental change. If the actual Applicable Price is less than $40.40 per share (subject to adjustment), the conversion rate will not be increased in connection with that make-whole fundamental change. Issuer will not increase the conversion rate pursuant to the Make-Whole Table set forth above to the extent that the increase will cause the conversion rate to exceed 24.7525 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Issuer will adjust this maximum conversion rate in the same manner in which, and for the same events for which, Issuer adjusts the conversion rate.

     In connection with the following opinions, we have examined and have relied upon copies of: (i) the Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, (ii) the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company (the "By-Laws"), (iii) the Indenture, dated as of November 20, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture"), (iv) the Supplemental Indenture No. 2, dated as of July 20, 2007, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture"), (v) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus included therein, (vi) the Prospectus Supplement, (vii) the resolutions regarding the offering of the Notes adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on May 3, 2007 and the Pricing Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company on July 16, 2007, (viii) the Underwriting Agreement between the Company and UBS Securities LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC, dated July 16, 2007, for the offering and sale of the Securities (the "Underwriting Agreement"), (ix) the form of global security evidencing the Notes (the "Global Security"), and (x) such other documents, records, certificates, statements, and instruments as we have deemed necessary and appropriate to render the opinions herein set forth.
 
     In reaching the opinions set forth below, we have assumed the following:
     As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied without independent investigation on (i) written representations of each party made in the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture and the other documents and certificates delivered in connection therewith, (ii) certificates and records of public officials, and (iii) certificates and written representations of officers and directors of the Company.
     Based upon the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof:
     The opinions set forth herein are subject to the following additional qualifications, assumptions and exceptions: (i) the enforceability of the Notes may be limited by the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors, and (ii) the
 
enforceability of the Notes may be limited by the effect of general principles of equity, whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief).
     The opinions set forth herein are limited to the matters and the transaction expressly addressed herein and no opinion is to be implied or may be inferred beyond the opinions expressly stated herein.
     We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provisions contained in the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture or the form of global security evidencing the Notes that constitute waivers that are prohibited by law prior to default.
     We assume no obligation to update or supplement this opinion to reflect a change in any applicable laws after the date hereof or any fact or circumstance that may come to our attention after the date hereof.
     The undersigned hereby consents to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5 to the Company's Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2007.

     Re:
Federal Income Tax Consequences
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special tax counsel to Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale of $400,000,000 principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the "Notes"), pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated July 16, 2007 ("Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus dated May 12, 2006 (collectively, the "Prospectus") included in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-134082) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You have requested our opinion regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters in connection with the filing of the Prospectus Supplement. Certain capitalized terms used herein without definition are as defined in the Registration Statement.
     In giving this opinion, we have examined the following:
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. July 20, 2007 Page 2
     In connection with the opinions rendered below, we have assumed with your consent that:
     1. Each of the documents referred to above has been duly authorized, executed and delivered; is authentic, if an original, or is accurate, if a copy; and has not been amended;
     2. During its taxable years ended December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2006, the Company has operated, and, in future taxable years, the Company will operate, in a manner that has caused or will make, as the case may be, the factual representations relating to the ownership, operation, future method of operations, and compliance of the Company with the real estate investment trust ("REIT") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury Regulations (the "Regulations") thereunder, as in effect as of the date hereof, contained in a certificate, dated on or about the date hereof and executed by a duly appointed officer of the Company (the "Officer's Certificate"), true for such years;
     3. The Company will not make any amendments to its organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would affect its qualification as a REIT under sections 856-860 of the Code for any taxable year; and
     4. No action will be taken by the Company after the date hereof that would have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinions set forth below are based.
     In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinions rendered below. For the purposes of rendering these opinions, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in any documents delivered to us, including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate. We have relied completely upon the Company's representations that the information presented in such documents accurately reflects all material facts. In the course of our representation of the Company, we have not been made aware of any facts inconsistent with such factual representations. In addition, where such factual representations involve terms defined or used in the Code, the Regulations, published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") or other relevant authority, we have explained such terms to the Company's representatives and are satisfied that the Company's representatives understand such terms and are capable of making such factual representations.
     Based on the Code, Regulations, documents, assumptions and statements set forth above, the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate and our review of
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. July 20, 2007 Page 3
the discussions in the Registration Statement and Prospectus under the captions "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 under the caption "Taxation," we are of the opinion that:
     (a) the Company qualified to be taxed as a REIT pursuant to sections 856 through 860 of the Code for its taxable years ended December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2006, and the Company's organization and current and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for all future taxable years; and
     (b) the descriptions of the law and the legal conclusions contained in the Registration Statement and Prospectus under the captions "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 under the caption "Taxation," fairly summarize the federal income tax considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Notes.
     We will not review on a continuing basis the Company's compliance with the documents or assumptions set forth above, or the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
     The foregoing opinions are based on current provisions of the Code and the Regulations, published administrative interpretations thereof and published court decisions and assume that none of these will change. No assurance, however, can be given that the law will not change in a way that will prevent the Company from qualifying as a REIT.
     The foregoing opinions are limited to the U.S. federal income tax matters addressed herein, and no other opinions are rendered with respect to other federal tax matters or to any issues arising under the tax laws of any other country, or any state or locality. You must judge for yourselves whether the matters addressed in this opinion letter are sufficient for your purposes. This letter speaks only as of this date, and we undertake no obligation to update the opinions expressed herein after the date of this
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. July 20, 2007 Page 4
letter. This opinion letter may not be distributed, or quoted in whole or in part, or otherwise reproduced in any document, or filed with any governmental agency, in each case without our express written consent.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not acknowledge that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
