     (viii) The Company has not, directly or indirectly, distributed and will not distribute any offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares other than the Prospectus and other materials, if any, permitted under the Securities Act and consistent with Section 4(ii) below. The Company will file with the Commission all Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses in the time and manner required under Rules 163(b)(2) and 433(d) under the Securities Act.
     (ix) (a) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (b) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) under the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (c) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) under the Securities Act) made any offer relating to the Shares in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 under the Securities Act and (d) at the date hereof, the Company is a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act objecting to the use of the automatic shelf registration form.
     (x) (a) At the earliest time after the filing the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) under the Securities Act) of the Shares and (b) as of the date hereof (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause(b)), the Company was not and is not an "ineligible issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, without taking into account any determination by the Commission pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act that it is not necessary that the Company be considered an ineligible issuer), including, without limitation, for purposes of Rules 164 and 433 under the Securities Act with respect to the offering of the Shares as contemplated by the Registration Statement.
     (xi) The financial statements of the Company, together with related notes and schedules, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, present fairly the financial position and the results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the indicated dates and for the indicated periods. Such financial statements and the related notes and schedules have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied throughout the periods involved, and all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results for such periods have been made. The summary financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus present fairly the information shown therein and, to the extent based upon or derived from the financial statements, have been compiled on a basis consistent with the financial statements presented therein. All disclosures contained in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, regarding "non-GAAP financial measures" (as such term is defined by the Rules and Regulations) comply with Regulation G of the Exchange Act and Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, to the extent applicable.
 
     (xii) There is no action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened (a) against the Company or its Subsidiaries or (b) involving any property of the Company or its Subsidiaries before any court or administrative agency which, if determined adversely to the Company or its Subsidiaries, might reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
     (xiii) The Company, together with its Subsidiaries, has good and marketable title to all of the properties and assets reflected in the financial statements hereinabove described (or as described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as owned by it), subject to no lien, mortgage, pledge, charge or encumbrance of any kind except those reflected in such financial statements (or as described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus) or which are not material in amount or which do not interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of the property. The leases, agreements to purchase and mortgages to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the guaranties of third parties (a) are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, of all other parties thereto, and the Company knows of no default or defenses currently existing with respect thereto which might reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect, and (b) conform to the descriptions thereof set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. Each mortgage which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds on the properties described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus constitutes a valid mortgage lien for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, on such property.
     (xiv) The Company has filed all Federal, state and foreign income tax returns which have been required to be filed and has paid all taxes indicated by said returns and all assessments received by it to the extent that such taxes have become due and are not being contested in good faith.

The Company has no material contingent obligations which are not disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
     (xvi) The Company is not in violation of its charter or by-laws. No Subsidiary is in violation of its charter or by-laws, which violation will have, or after any required notice and passage of any applicable grace period would have, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are (a) in default under any agreement, lease, contract, indenture or other instrument or obligation to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
 
properties is bound, (b) in violation of any statute, or (c) in violation of any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its properties, of any court or of any regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body, any of which defaults or violations described in clauses (a) through (c) will have, or after any required notice and passage of any applicable grace period would have, a Material Adverse Effect. The issue and sale of the Shares and the performance by the Company of all of its obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated and the fulfillment of the terms hereof will not after any required notice and passage of any applicable grace period conflict with or constitute a violation of any statute or conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, constitute a default under or result in the imposition of any lien pursuant to, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other agreement or instrument to which the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, or a violation of its charter or by-laws or any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its properties of any court or of any regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body.
     (xvii) Each approval, consent, order, authorization, designation, declaration or filing by or with any regulatory, administrative or other governmental body necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated (except such additional steps as may be required by the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") or may be necessary to qualify the Shares for public offering by the Underwriter under state securities or Blue Sky laws) has been obtained or made by the Company, and is in full force and effect.
     (xviii) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates and permits from governmental authorities which are necessary to the conduct of their businesses and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have received any notice of infringement or of conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any patents, patent rights, trade names, trademarks or copyrights, which infringement is material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
     (xix) The Company qualifies as a real estate investment trust pursuant to Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, has so qualified for the taxable years ended December 31, 1984 through December 31, 2006 and no transaction or other event has occurred or is contemplated which would prevent the Company from so qualifying for its current taxable year.

     (xxi) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets; (c) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (d) the recorded
 
     accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any      differences.
     (xxii) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to perform the functions for which they were established; the Company's auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company have been advised of: (a) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data; and (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a role in the Company's internal controls; any material weaknesses in internal controls have been identified for the Company's auditors; and since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
     (xxiii) Since July 30, 2002, the Company has not, directly or indirectly, including through any subsidiary: (a) extended credit, arranged to extend credit, or renewed any extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan, to or for any director or executive officer of the Company, or to or for any family member or affiliate of any director or executive officer of the Company; or (b) made any material modification, including any renewal thereof, to any term of any personal loan to any director or executive officer of the Company, or any family member or affiliate of any director or executive officer, which loan was outstanding on July 30, 2002.

     (xxvi) Neither the Company nor any of its officers or directors has taken nor will any of them take, directly or indirectly, any action resulting in a violation of Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act, or designed to cause or result in, or which has constituted or which reasonably might be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Company's Common Stock. The Company acknowledges that the Underwriter may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Company's Common Stock, including stabilizing bids, syndicate covering transactions and the imposition of penalty bids.
     (xxvii) The Shares have been, or as of the Closing Date will be, approved for listing upon official notice of issuance on the New York Stock Exchange.
     (xxviii) The Company is not, and immediately after the sale of the Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not be, an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 
     On the basis of the representations, warranties and covenants herein contained, and subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to the Underwriter, and the Underwriter agrees to purchase from the Company, at a price of $42.14 per Share, 3,500,000 Firm Shares.
2. Purchase, Sale and Delivery of the Shares.
          Payment for the Firm Shares to be sold hereunder is to be made by Federal Funds wire transfer to an account designated by the Company for the Firm Shares to be sold by the Company against delivery of the Firm Shares therefor to the Underwriter. Such payment and delivery are to be made at the offices of UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. New York time, on December 7, 2007 or at such other time and date thereafter as the Underwriter and the Company shall agree upon, such time and date being herein referred to as the "Closing Date." (As used herein, "business day" means a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which banks in New York are open for business and not permitted by law or executive order to be closed). The Firm Shares will be delivered by Mellon Investor Services LLC (the "Transfer Agent") in such denominations and in such registrations as the Underwriter requests in writing not later than the second full business day prior to the Closing Date, and will be delivered through book entry facilities of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and made available for inspection by the Underwriter at least one business day prior to the Closing Date at such place as the Underwriter, DTC and the Company shall agree.
          In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the Underwriter to purchase the Option Shares at the price per share as set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 2. The option granted hereby may be exercised in whole or in part by giving notice (i) at any time before the Closing Date and (ii) only once thereafter within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, by the Underwriter to the Company setting forth the number of Option Shares as to which the Underwriter is exercising the option and the time and date at which such Option Shares are to be delivered. The time and date at which the Option Shares are to be delivered shall be determined by the Underwriter but shall not be earlier than three nor later than 10 full business days after the exercise of such option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Date (such time and date being herein referred to as the "Option Closing Date"). If the date of exercise of the option is three or more days before the Closing Date, the notice of exercise shall set the Closing Date as the Option Closing Date. The option with respect to the Option Shares granted hereunder may be exercised only to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Shares by the Underwriter. The Underwriter may cancel such option at any time prior to its expiration by giving written notice of such cancellation to the Company. To the extent, if any, that the option is exercised, payment for the Option Shares shall be made by Federal Funds wire transfer to an account designated by the Company for the Option Shares to be sold by the Company against delivery of the Option Shares through the facilities of DTC. Such payment and delivery are to be made at the offices of UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. New York time, on the Option Closing Date.

The Underwriter may from time to time thereafter change the public offering price and other selling terms.
3. Offering by the Underwriter.
 
          The Company covenants and agrees with the Underwriter that:

          (v) The Company will pay the fees applicable to the Registration Statement in connection with the offering of the Shares within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1)(i) under the Securities Act (without reliance on the proviso to Rule 456(b)(1)(i) under the Securities Act) and in compliance with Rule 456(b) and Rule 457(r) under the Securities Act.
          (vi) If at any time when Shares remain unsold by the Underwriter the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (a) promptly notify the Underwriter, (b) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Underwriter, (c) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable (if such filing is not otherwise effective immediately pursuant to Rule 462 under the Securities Act), and (d) promptly notify the Underwriter of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Shares to continue as contemplated in the Registration Statement that was the subject of the notice under Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement relating to the Shares shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
          (vii) If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Shares remain unsold by the Underwriter, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Underwriter. If the Company is not eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Underwriter, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline.

          (viii) The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Underwriter, from time to time, as many copies of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Underwriter during the period when delivery of a Prospectus (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to under Rule 173(a) under
 
the Securities Act) is required under the Securities Act, as many copies of the Prospectus in final form, or as thereafter amended or supplemented, as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to the Underwriter at or before the Closing Date, one signed copy of the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto including all exhibits filed therewith, and will deliver to the Underwriter such number of copies of the Registration Statement, including documents incorporated by reference therein, but without exhibits, and of all amendments thereto, as the Underwriter may reasonably request.
          (ix) The Company will comply with the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Shares as contemplated in this Agreement and the Prospectus. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(i) above, if during the period in which a prospectus (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to under Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered by the Underwriter or a dealer any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriter, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or, if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with law.
          (x) If the General Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Shares at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriter, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or to make the statements therein not conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare, file with the Commission (if required) and furnish to the Underwriter and any dealers an appropriate amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the General Disclosure Package so that the General Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or conflict with the Registration Statement then on file, or so that the General Disclosure Package will comply with law.
          (xi) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as it is practicable to do so, but in any event not later than 15 months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement (which need not be audited) in reasonable detail, covering a period of twelve consecutive months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 under the Securities Act.
          (xii) The Company will, for a period of five years from the Closing Date, deliver to the Underwriter copies of annual reports and copies of all other documents, reports and information furnished by the Company to its stockholders or filed with any securities exchange
 
pursuant to the requirements of such exchange or with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The Company will deliver to the Underwriter similar reports with respect to significant subsidiaries, as that term is defined in the Rules and Regulations, which are not consolidated in the Company's financial statements.
          (xiii) The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified under the heading "Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus.
          (xiv) No offering, sale or other disposition of any Common Stock or any securities of the Company that are substantially similar to the Common Stock will be made for a period of 60 days after the date of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, by the Company otherwise than hereunder or with the prior written consent of UBS Securities LLC, except that the Company may, without such consent, (a) issue securities under the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the Commission on March 12, 2007; (b) issue shares upon the exercise of options or other stock rights issued pursuant to the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the Commission on March 12, 2007 and the Windrose Medical Properties Trust 2002 Stock Incentive Plan; (c) sell shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan filed with the Commission on May 15, 2007; (d) issue shares of Common Stock upon conversion of any shares of 6% Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock or 7.5% Series G Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding as of the date hereof; or (e) issue shares of Common Stock upon conversion of any 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 and 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 outstanding as of the date hereof.
          The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: the fees incident to the issuance and delivery of the Shares; accounting fees of the Company; the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; the cost of printing and delivering to, or as requested by, the Underwriter, copies of the Registration Statement, the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, the Prospectus, this Agreement, the applicable listing agreement for the New York Stock Exchange; the filing fees of the Commission; the filing fees and expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) incident to securing any required review by the NASD of the terms of the sale of the Shares; the fees incident to the listing of the Shares on the New York Stock Exchange and the applicable listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange. Any transfer taxes imposed on the sale of the Shares to the Underwriter will be paid by the Company. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of the Underwriter's expenses except that, if this Agreement shall not be consummated because the conditions in Section 7 hereof are not satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriter pursuant to Section 6 hereof, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(i)(a) or Section 10(i)(h) hereof, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on its part to be performed, unless such failure to satisfy said condition or to comply with said terms be due to the default or omission of the Underwriter, then the Company shall reimburse the Underwriter for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing to market the Shares or in contemplation of performing its obligations hereunder, but the Company shall not in any event be liable

          (f) The statements under the caption "Description of Our Common Stock" in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of documents referred to therein or matters of law, are accurate summaries and fairly and correctly present in all material respects the information called for with respect to such documents and matters.

          (h) Such counsel does not know of any contracts or documents required to be filed as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto which are not so filed, incorporated by reference or described as required, and such contracts and documents as are summarized in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto are fairly summarized in all material respects.
          (i) Such counsel knows of no material legal proceedings pending or threatened against the Company, except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
          (j) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated, including the issuance and sale of the Shares and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, do not and will not after any required notice and passage of any applicable grace period conflict with or constitute a violation of any statute or conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, constitute a default under or result in the imposition of any lien pursuant to, the charter or by-laws of the Company, any material agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or the Company's properties may be bound or any order known to such counsel or rule or

          (n) The Company is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
          (o) Any required filing of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act has been made within the time period required by Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act.
          In addition, either such counsel or Arnold & Porter LLP, special tax counsel to the Company, will provide an opinion, based on such counsel's own review of the Company's certificate of incorporation, stating that the Company was organized and continues to be organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and, based on such counsel's review of the Company's federal income tax returns and discussions with management and independent public accountants for the Company, that the Company, taking into account operations for its taxable and fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2006, satisfied the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for such years and that its proposed method of operation will enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for its taxable and fiscal year ending December 31, 2007. Furthermore, such counsel shall opine that the statements contained under the heading "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the Commission on March 12, 2007, and any amendments thereto (and any similar sections or information contained in the General Disclosure Package) are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax treatment of the Company and of its stockholders.
          In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters governed by the laws of states other than the laws of the State of Ohio, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware or Federal laws on local counsel in such jurisdictions, provided that in such case such counsel shall state that they believe that they and the Underwriter are justified in relying on such other counsel
 
and such other counsel shall indicate that the Underwriter may rely on such opinion. As to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, such counsel may rely on certificates of officers of the Company and public officials so long as such counsel states that they have no reason to believe that either the Underwriter or they are not justified in relying on such certificates. In addition to the matters set forth above, the opinion of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP shall also include a statement to the effect that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which leads them to believe that (a) the Registration Statement, as of the time of its effectiveness for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act and as of the Applicable Time, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (c) the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, on the date it was filed pursuant to the Rules and Regulations and as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements, schedules and other financial information included therein). With respect to such statement, Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP may state that this statement is based upon the procedures set forth or incorporated by reference therein, but is without independent check and verification.
          (iv) The Underwriter shall have received from Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriter, on the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, an opinion dated the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, with respect to the organization of the Company, the validity of the Shares, the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and other related matters as the Underwriter reasonably may request and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.
          (v) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Underwriter shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a signed letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter, dated the date hereof (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission and (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the General Disclosure Package and containing such other statements and information as is ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings.
          (vi) With respect to the letter of Ernst & Young LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Underwriter concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letter"), the Company shall have furnished to the Underwriter a letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter (the "bring-down letter"), of such accountants, dated the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with
 
respect to the financial information and other matters covered by the initial letter and the financial information examined by them and included in the Prospectus and (c) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letter.
          (vii) The Underwriter shall have received on the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, a certificate or certificates of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that on and as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, each of them severally represents as follows:
          (a) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or no order preventing or suspending the use of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus has been issued, and no proceedings for such purpose have been taken or are, to his knowledge, contemplated by the Commission.
          (b) Subsequent to the delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of (A) any intended or potential downgrading or (B) any review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating, if any, accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the Securities Act.
          (c) He does not know of any litigation instituted or threatened against the Company of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus which is not so disclosed therein or in a document incorporated by reference therein; he does not know of any material contract required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement which is not so filed therein or in a document incorporated by reference therein.
          (d) He has carefully examined the General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus and, in his opinion, as of the Applicable Time, the statements contained in the General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, and such General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, did not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
          (e) He has carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in his opinion, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, were true and correct, and such Registration Statement and Prospectus, or any document incorporated by reference therein, did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and, in his opinion, since the effective date of the Registration Statement, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Prospectus which has not been so set forth in such supplement or amendment.
 
          (f) The representations and warranties of the Company as set forth in this Agreement are true and correct as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, as if made on such date. The Company has performed all of its obligations under this Agreement as are to be performed at or before the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be. The representations and warranties made in this clause (f) shall be deemed made by the Company.
          (viii) The Underwriter shall have received at or prior to the Closing Date, an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter, signed by the executive officers of the Company to the effect that they will not, prior to the expiration of 60 days from the date of this Agreement, offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock, securities of the Company substantially similar to the Common Stock, or any securities that the executive officers have, or will have, the right to acquire through the exercise of options, warrants, subscription or other rights, without the prior written consent of UBS Securities LLC, except (a) pursuant to bona fide gifts, provided that the Company shall have delivered to UBS Securities LLC written consent to such gift, but in no event shall the gifts under this subsection (a) of the executive officers exceed 75,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, (b) pursuant to routine dispositions under Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plans entered into by certain executive officers of the Company prior to or after the date hereof, but in no event shall the dispositions under this subsection (b) of the executive officers of the Company exceed 300,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, and (c) shares obtained pursuant to the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors, provided that the Company shall have delivered to UBS Securities LLC written consent to such sale, but in no event shall the sales under this subsection (c) of the executive officers exceed 500,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate.
          (ix) The Shares to be sold by the Company as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange.

                    If any of the conditions hereinabove provided for in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement to be fulfilled, the obligations of the Underwriter hereunder may be terminated by the Underwriter by notifying the Company of such termination in writing or by telecopy at or prior to the Closing Date. In such event, the Company and the Underwriter shall not be under any obligation to each other (except to the extent provided in Sections 5 and 8 hereof).
          The obligations of the Company to sell and deliver the portion of the Shares required to be delivered as and when specified in this Agreement are subject to the conditions that at the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and in effect or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened.

subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (b) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, or (c) any act or failure to act, or any alleged act or failure to act by the Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Shares or the offering contemplated hereby, and will reimburse the Underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
          (ii) The Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Underwriter may otherwise have.
          (iii) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing; provided that the failure to so notify will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that the indemnifying party
 
may have on account of the provisions of Sections 8(i) or (ii) or otherwise, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall not have otherwise learned of such proceeding and such failure is materially prejudicial to the indemnifying party. In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event (a) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (b) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit notwithstanding its obligation to bear the fees and expenses of such counsel. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties and one local counsel. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriter in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(i) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(ii). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the fifth sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent to which the indemnification obligations of the Company hereunder are applicable if (a) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (b) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
          (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless to the extent required therein an indemnified party under Sections 8(i) or (ii) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriter from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(iii) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriter in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriter shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Underwriter bear to the total proceeds of the offering
 
(the proceeds received by the Underwriter being equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter), in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
          The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(iv) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(iv). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(iv) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(iv), (a) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Shares purchased by the Underwriter and (b) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
          (v) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 8 hereby consents to the jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon him or it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join him or it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.
          All communications hereunder shall be in writing and, except as otherwise provided herein, will be mailed, delivered or telecopied and confirmed as follows: if to the Underwriter, to UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10171, or via fax at (212) 821-4610, Attention: Equity Capital Markets, with a copy to the General Counsel via fax at (212) 821-4042; if to the Company, to Health Care REIT, Inc., One SeaGate, Suite 1500, Toledo, Ohio 43603-1475, or via fax at (419) 247-2826, Attention: George L. Chapman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.

Exhibit 8
Health Care REIT, Inc. One SeaGate Suite 1500 Toledo, Ohio 43604
Re:
Federal Income Tax Consequences
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special tax counsel to Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale of 3,500,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Stock"), pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated December 3, 2007 ("Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus dated May 12, 2006 (collectively, the "Prospectus") included in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-134082) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You have requested our opinion regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement. Certain capitalized terms used herein without definition are as defined in the Registration Statement.
     In giving this opinion, we have examined the following:
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. December 5, 2007 Page 2
     In connection with the opinions rendered below, we have assumed with your consent that:
     1. Each of the documents referred to above has been duly authorized, executed and delivered; is authentic, if an original, or is accurate, if a copy; and has not been amended;
     2. During its taxable years ended December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2006, the Company has operated, and, in future taxable years, the Company will operate, in a manner that has caused or will make, as the case may be, the factual representations relating to the ownership, operation, future method of operations, and compliance of the Company with the real estate investment trust ("REIT") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury Regulations (the "Regulations") thereunder, as in effect as of the date hereof, contained in a certificate, dated on or about the date hereof and executed by a duly appointed officer of the Company (the "Officer's Certificate"), true for such years;
     3. The Company will not make any amendments to its organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would affect its qualification as a REIT under sections 856-860 of the Code for any taxable year; and
     4. No action will be taken by the Company after the date hereof that would have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinions set forth below are based.
     In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinions rendered below. For the purposes of rendering these opinions, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in any documents delivered to us, including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate. We have relied completely upon the Company's representations that the information presented in such documents accurately reflects all material facts. In the course of our representation of the Company, we have not been made aware of any facts inconsistent with such factual representations. In addition, where such factual representations involve terms defined or used in the Code, the Regulations, published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") or other relevant authority, we have explained such terms to the Company's representatives and are satisfied that the Company's representatives understand such terms and are capable of making such factual representations.
     Based on the Code, Regulations, documents, assumptions and statements set forth above, the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate and our review of
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. December 5, 2007 Page 3
the discussions in the Prospectus under the caption "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 under the caption "Taxation," we are of the opinion that:
     (a) the Company qualified to be taxed as a REIT pursuant to sections 856 through 860 of the Code for its taxable years ended December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2006, and the Company's organization and current and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for all future taxable years; and
     (b) the descriptions of the law and the legal conclusions contained in the Prospectus under the caption "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 under the caption "Taxation," fairly summarize the federal income tax considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Common Stock.
     We will not review on a continuing basis the Company's compliance with the documents or assumptions set forth above, or the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
     The foregoing opinions are based on current provisions of the Code and the Regulations, published administrative interpretations thereof and published court decisions and assume that none of these will change. No assurance, however, can be given that the law will not change in a way that will prevent the Company from qualifying as a REIT.
     The foregoing opinions are limited to the U.S. federal income tax matters addressed herein, and no other opinions are rendered with respect to other federal tax matters or to any issues arising under the tax laws of any other country, or any state or locality. You must judge for yourselves whether the matters addressed in this opinion letter are sufficient for your purposes. This letter speaks only as of this date, and we undertake no obligation to update the opinions expressed herein after the date of this letter. This opinion letter may not be distributed, or quoted in whole or in part, or
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. December 5, 2007 Page 4
otherwise reproduced in any document, or filed with any governmental agency, in each case without our express written consent.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not acknowledge that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Very truly yours,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Toledo, Ohio, December 4, 2007...today announced that it has priced a public offering of 3,500,000 shares of its common stock. Health Care REIT is granting the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 525,000 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any.

Pending such use, the proceeds will primarily be used to repay borrowings under Health Care REIT's unsecured line of credit.
