Other Events.
Effective October 23, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") adopted new rules related to insider trading. One of these rules, Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), provides an exemption to the insider trading rules in the form of an affirmative defense. Rule 10b5-1 recognizes the creation of formal programs under which executives and other insiders may sell the securities of publicly traded companies on a regular basis pursuant to written plans that are entered into at a time when the plan participants are not aware of material non-public information and that otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1.
