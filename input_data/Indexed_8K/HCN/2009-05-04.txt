Toledo, Ohio, May 4, 2009.........today announced operating results for the company's first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN)
"We are off to a solid start this year as our portfolio performance and financial results were in line with our expectations," commented George L. Chapman, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Health Care REIT, Inc. "Thus far in 2009, we have raised over $400 million in capital through a combination of equity, secured debt and selective asset sales.

As previously announced, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 of $0.68 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share for the same period in 2008. The cash dividend will be paid on May 20, 2009 and will be the company's 152 consecutive quarterly dividend payment.
Dividends for First Quarter 2009
.
nd
The company is revising its 2009 normalized FFO and FAD guidance primarily due to the additional secured debt capital transactions now included in the forecast. In addition to the $133 million, 10-year, 6.10% Freddie Mac mortgage loan completed in April, the company expects to raise an additional $200 to $300 million of secured debt at approximately 6.0% to 6.5% during the second half of 2009.
Outlook for 2009
.
Normalized FFO has been revised to a range of $3.10 to $3.20 per diluted share from $3.20 to $3.30 per diluted share. Normalized FAD has been revised to a range of $2.96 to $3.06 per diluted share from $3.08 to $3.18 per diluted share. FFO guidance should be compared to the $3.33 per diluted share actual 2008 results as restated for the convertible debt accounting change.
Net income attributable to common stockholders has been increased to a range of $1.70 to $1.80 per diluted share from $1.59 to $1.69 per diluted share. The increase in net income guidance is primarily due to the $17.0 million of gains on sales of real estate, lower projected depreciation expense and $1.7 million of debt extinguishment gains partially offset by the incremental secured debt assumptions.
The company's guidance excludes any impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional one-time items, including any additional cash payments other than normal monthly rental payments. Please see the exhibits for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO and FAD.
The company has scheduled a conference call on Tuesday, May 5, 2009 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its first quarter 2009 results, industry trends, portfolio performance and outlook for 2009. Telephone access will be available by dialing 888-346-2469 or 706-758-4923 (international). For those unable to listen to the call live, a taped rebroadcast will be available beginning two hours after completion of the call through May 19, 2009. To access the rebroadcast, dial 800-642-1687 or 706-645-9291 (international). The conference ID number is 92034109. To participate in the webcast, log on to www.hcreit.com or www.earnings.com 15 minutes before the call to download the necessary software. Replays will be available for 90 days through the same websites. This earnings release is posted on the company's website under the heading News & Events.
Conference Call Information
.
The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for unusual and non-recurring items. FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings. Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for unusual and non-recurring items.
Supplemental Reporting Measures
.
Page 2 of 8
 
The company's supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of the supplemental reporting measures.

The ratio of total square feet expiring and available for lease to total renewed square feet.
Renewal Rate:
Square feet expiring during the reporting period upon which a lease is executed by the current occupant.
Renewed Square Feet:
A property where the resident pays a monthly market rate for the level of care provided, but is not required to pay a substantial upfront fee.
Rental:
Represents the ratio of total revenue to occupied units based on the most recent quarter of available data and excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed, or for which data is not available or meaningful. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate revenue per occupied unit and has not independently verified the information.
Revenue per Occupied Unit:
For the medical office building portfolio, same store is defined as those properties owned for the entire previous five quarters. Properties acquired, developed or classified in discontinued operations are excluded from the same store amounts. For all other property types, same store is defined as those properties in the stable portfolio for the 24 months preceding the end of the portfolio performance reporting period, unless otherwise noted.
Same Store:
Skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement.

Specialty care facilities generally include acute care hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals and other specialty care facilities. Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including, but not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories. Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions who require more intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities. Other specialty care facilities typically provide specialized inpatient and outpatient care for specific illnesses or diseases, including, among others, orthopedic and neurologic care.
Specialty Care:
Net rentable square feet calculated utilizing Building Owners and Managers Association measurement standards.
Square Feet:
A facility will generally enter the stable portfolio after it has generated CAMF of 1.10x or greater for three consecutive months. Additionally, a facility will enter the stable portfolio if a facility fails to meet the above criteria in the 12 months following the budgeted stabilization date.
Stable:
An acquisition that does not meet the stable criteria upon closing or a construction property that has opened but not yet reached stabilization.
Unstabilized:
Represents annualized contractual income that was being received in cash at date of disposition divided by disposition cash proceeds.
Yield on Sale:

SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING MEASURES
The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for unusual and non-recurring items. FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings. Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for unusual and non-recurring items.
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. A covenant in our line of credit arrangement contains a financial ratio based on a definition of EBITDA that is specific to that agreement. Failure to satisfy this covenant could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Due to the materiality of this debt agreement and the financial covenant, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above and adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses and gain/loss on extinguishment of debt. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. Fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. Our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge ratio of at least 1.75 times.
Net operating income (NOI) is used to evaluate the operating performance of the company's properties. The company defines NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements and discontinued operations, less property operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments and interest expense. The company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the company's properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. The company uses NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
Other than Adjusted EBITDA, the company's supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. Adjusted EBITDA is used solely to determine our compliance with a financial covenant of our line of credit arrangement and is not being presented for use by investors for any other purpose. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Multi-period amounts may not equal the sum of the individual quarterly amounts due to rounding.
