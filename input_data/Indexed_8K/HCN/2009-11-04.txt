Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Toledo, Ohio, November 4, 2009........today announced operating results for the company's third quarter ended September 30, 2009.
Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN)
"In the face of the significant challenges of 2009, we successfully disposed of non-core assets and will have completed over $700 million of development projects. We believe that these larger, consumer-driven senior housing properties and state-of-the-art medical facilities are excellent additions to our portfolio," commented George L. Chapman, chairman, CEO and president of Health Care REIT, Inc. "In addition, the continued strength of our property level rent coverage is a testament to the resiliency of our senior housing and health care real estate.
"At the same time, we strengthened our balance sheet this year. We raised $1 billion in attractively priced equity and debt and generated over $150 million in proceeds from asset sales. We further enhanced our maturity schedule in the third quarter by prepaying higher cost debt and reduced our leverage to near historic lows. Although deleveraging the balance sheet has impacted year-over-year earnings comparisons, more importantly it has put us in an excellent capital position while reducing future interest expense. With over $1 billion of current cash and line availability, we are positioned to capitalize on investment opportunities consistent with our strategy of partnering with strong operators and health systems that will redefine the senior housing and health care experience."

Conference Call Information
.
The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for unusual and non-recurring items. FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings. Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for unusual and non-recurring items.
Supplemental Reporting Measures
.
The company's supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as

alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of the supplemental reporting measures.
