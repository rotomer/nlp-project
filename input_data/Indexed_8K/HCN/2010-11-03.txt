The company is increasing its investment guidance for 2010. It now expects to complete acquisitions and joint venture investments of $2.0 to $2.3 billion, up from $1.5 to $1.8 billion, and dispositions of $200 million, down from $300 million. The company continues to expect funded new development of $300 to $400 million, resulting in net new investments of $2.1 to $2.5 billion.
Outlook for 2010
The company is revising the midpoints of its 2010 normalized FFO and FAD guidance solely as a result of the capital transactions completed during the third quarter which were not in the previous guidance. Normalized FFO has been revised to a range of $3.13 to $3.16 per diluted share from $3.13 to $3.20 per diluted share. Normalized FAD has been revised to a range of $2.89 to $2.92 per diluted share from $2.89 to $2.96 per diluted share.
Net income attributable to common stockholders has been reduced to a range of $0.98 to $1.01 per diluted share from $1.33 to $1.40 per diluted share. The decrease in net income guidance is primarily due to the capital transactions noted above, $28.9 million of loan losses, $9.1 million of debt extinguishment losses and $18.8 million of transaction costs offset by $10.5 million of gains on sales of real property recognized in the third quarter.
The company's guidance excludes any additional capital transactions, impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional one-time items, including any additional cash payments other than normal monthly rental payments. Please see the exhibits for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO and FAD.

Conference Call Information
The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1. FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings. Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1. The company believes that normalized FFO and normalized FAD are useful supplemental measures of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use these measures to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.
Supplemental Reporting Measures
The company's supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of the supplemental reporting measures.
