Proceeding
 
pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, the Manager or such person shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and the Company shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability which the Company may have to the Manager or any such person or otherwise except to the extent the Company was materially prejudiced by such omission.

provided
however
               (b) The Manager agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers, and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Company or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in and, in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Manager to the Company expressly for use with reference to the Manager in the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company), or arises out of or is based
 
upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Manager to the Company expressly for use in, a Prospectus or a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
               If any Proceeding is brought against the Company or any such person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Manager pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, the Company or such person shall promptly notify the Manager in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and the Manager shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify the Manager shall not relieve the Manager from any liability which the Manager may have to the Company or any such person or otherwise. The Company or such person shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Company or such person unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the Manager in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the Manager shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to or in conflict with those available to the Manager (in which case the Manager shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties, but the Manager may employ counsel and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Manager), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the Manager and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that the Manager shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The Manager shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without the written consent of the Manager but if settled with the written consent of the Manager, the Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and any such person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested the Manager to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this paragraph, then the Manager agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by the Manager of the aforesaid request, (ii) the Manager shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the Manager at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle.

provided
however
 
unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.
               (c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Manager, on the other hand, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Manager, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Manager, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Manager, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Manager, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Manager and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
               (d) The Company and the Manager agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (c) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (c) above shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Manager shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of commissions received by it under this Agreement. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7(d), each officer and employee of the Manager and each person, if any, who controls the Manager within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Manager, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
               (e) The Company and the Manager agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the
 
Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares, or in connection with the Registration Statement, any Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.
               SECTION 8. . The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Section 7 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto or any Terms Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Manager, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls the Manager within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Shares.
Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery

               (a) The Company shall have the right, by giving written notice as hereinafter specified, to terminate the provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase the Shares in its sole discretion at any time.

               (b) The Manager shall have the right, by giving written notice as hereinafter specified, to terminate the provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation of offers to purchase the Shares in its sole discretion at any time.

                    Unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section 9, this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the issuance and sale of Shares through the Manager and the Alternative Managers pursuant to this Agreement and the Alternative Distribution Agreements having an aggregate dollar value equal to the Maximum Amount.
               (c) This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless terminated pursuant to Sections 9(a) or (b) above or otherwise by mutual agreement of the parties; that any such termination by mutual agreement shall in all cases be deemed to provide that Section 5, Section 7 and Section 8 shall remain in full force and effect.
provided

Exhibit 5
George L. Chapman Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President Health Care REIT, Inc. 4500 Dorr Street Toledo, OH 43615
Dear Mr. Chapman:
     We have acted as counsel to Health Care REIT, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the offering of shares of its common stock, par value $1.00 per share, having an aggregate offering price of $250,000,000 (the "Shares"), pursuant to the prospectus supplement dated November 12, 2010 (the "Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus dated May 7, 2009 (the "Prospectus"), included in the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159040) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").
     In connection with the following opinion, we have examined and have relied upon copies of: (i) the Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, (ii) the Second Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company (the "By-Laws"), (iii) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus included therein, (iv) the Prospectus Supplement, (v) the resolutions regarding the offering of the Shares adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on May 4, 2006, July 22, 2008, January 29, 2009, January 29, 2009, May 6, 2010 and October 28, 2010, and by the Pricing Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company on November 5, 2008, May 8, 2009, June 8, 2009, June 9, 2009, August 10, 2009, August 11, 2009, August 12, 2009, August 13, 2009, August 20, 2009, August 21, 2009, August 24, 2009, August 25, 2009, August 12, 2010, August 13, 2010, August 16, 2010, August 17, 2010, August 18, 2010, August 19, 2010, August 23, 2010, August 24, 2010, August 25, 2010 and November 12, 2010, (vi) the separate Equity Distribution Agreements between the Company and each of UBS Securities LLC, RBS Securities Inc., KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., each dated November 12, 2010, for the offering and sale of the Shares (the "Equity Distribution Agreements") and (vii) such other documents, records, certificates, statements, and instruments as we have deemed necessary and appropriate to render the opinion

     Based upon the foregoing, it is our opinion that the Shares will be, when issued and sold in the manner set forth in the Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying Prospectus, legally and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable.
     The opinion set forth herein is limited to the matters and the transaction expressly addressed herein and no opinion is to be implied or may be inferred beyond the opinion expressly stated herein.

Exhibit 8
Health Care REIT, Inc. 4500 Dorr Street Toledo, Ohio 43615
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special tax counsel to Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale of shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000,000, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Stock"), pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated November 12, 2010 to the prospectus dated May 7, 2009 (collectively, the "Prospectus") included in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159040) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You have requested our opinion regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 6 of each Equity Distribution Agreement dated November 12, 2010, between the Company and UBS Securities LLC, RBS Securities Inc., KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., and Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., respectively (each a "Manager," collectively the "Managers") (each such agreement, an "Agreement," collectively the "Agreements"), in connection with the fulfillment of one of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the Managers to sell, on behalf of the Company, the Common Stock. Certain capitalized terms used herein without definition are as defined in the Agreements and Registration Statement.
     In giving this opinion, we have examined the following:
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. November 12, 2010 Page 2
     In connection with the opinions rendered below, we have assumed with your consent that:
     1. Each of the documents referred to above has been duly authorized, executed and delivered; is authentic, if an original, or is accurate, if a copy; and has not been amended;
     2. During its taxable years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2009, the Company has operated, and, in future taxable years, the Company will operate, in a manner that has caused or will make, as the case may be, the factual representations relating to the ownership, operation, future method of operations, and compliance of the Company with the real estate investment trust ("REIT") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury Regulations (the "Regulations") thereunder, as in effect as of the date hereof, contained in a certificate dated as of the date hereof, and executed by a duly appointed officer of the Company (the "Officer's Certificate"), true for such years;
     3. The Company will not make any amendments to its organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would affect its qualification as a REIT under sections 856-860 of the Code for any taxable year; and
     4. No action will be taken by the Company after the date hereof that would have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinions set forth below are based.
     In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinions rendered below. For the purposes of rendering these opinions, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in any documents delivered to us, including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate. We have relied completely upon the Company's representations that the information presented in such documents accurately reflects all material facts. In the course of our representation of the Company, we have not been made aware of any facts inconsistent with such factual representations. In addition, where such factual representations involve terms defined or
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. November 12, 2010 Page 3
used in the Code, the Regulations, published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") or other relevant authority, we have explained such terms to the Company's representatives and are satisfied that the Company's representatives understand such terms and are capable of making such factual representations.
     Based on the Code, Regulations, documents, assumptions and statements set forth above, the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate and our review of the discussions incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus under the caption "Federal Income Tax Considerations" and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 under the caption "Taxation," we are of the opinion that:
     (a) the Company is qualified to be taxed as a REIT pursuant to sections 856 through 860 of the Code for its taxable years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2009, and the Company's organization and current and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for all future taxable years; and
     (b) the statements contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus under the caption "Federal Income Tax Considerations" and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 under the caption "Taxation" are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax (i) treatment of the Company and (ii) considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Common Stock.
     We will not review on a continuing basis the Company's compliance with the documents or assumptions set forth above, or the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
     The foregoing opinions are based on current provisions of the Code and the Regulations, published administrative interpretations thereof and published court decisions and assume that none of these will change. No assurance, however, can be
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. November 12, 2010 Page 4
given that the law will not change in a way that will prevent the Company from qualifying as a REIT.
     The foregoing opinions are limited to the U.S. federal income tax matters addressed herein, and no other opinions are rendered with respect to other federal tax matters or to any issues arising under the tax laws of any other country, or any state or locality. You must judge for yourselves whether the matters addressed in this opinion letter are sufficient for your purposes. This letter speaks only of this date, and we undertake no obligation to update the opinions expressed herein after the date of this letter. This opinion letter may not be distributed, or quoted in whole or in part, or otherwise reproduced in any document, or filed with any governmental agency, in each case without our express written consent.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about the date hereof. In giving this consent, we do not acknowledge that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Arnold & Porter LLP
