of the receipt of any comments from the Commission, (c) of any request of the Commission for amendment of the Registration Statement or the filing of a new registration statement or any amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any document incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or for any additional information, and (d) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or such new registration statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or of the institution of any proceedings for that purpose for so long as the Representatives may deem necessary in order to complete the distribution of the Notes, or of the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and the Company will use its best efforts to prevent (x) the issuance of any such stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or such new registration statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or (y) any such suspension of the qualification of the Notes for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and to obtain as soon as possible the lifting of any such order, if issued, or such suspension of qualification.
     (v) The Company will pay the fees applicable to the Registration Statement in connection with the offering of the Notes within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1)(i) under the Securities Act (without reliance on the proviso to Rule 456(b)(1)(i) under the Securities Act) and in compliance with Rule 456(b) and Rule 457(r) under the Securities Act.
     (vi) If at any time when Notes remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (a) promptly notify the Representatives, (b) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (c) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable (if such filing is not otherwise effective immediately pursuant to Rule 462 under the Securities Act), and (d) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the Registration Statement that was the subject of the notice under Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement relating to the Notes shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
     (vii) If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Notes remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives. If the Company is not eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
 
     (viii) The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Representatives, from time to time, as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will deliver to, or upon the order of, the Representatives during the period when delivery of a Prospectus (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to under Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required under the Securities Act, as many copies of the Prospectus in final form, or as thereafter amended or supplemented, as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will furnish upon request to the Representatives signed copies of the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto including all exhibits filed therewith.
     (ix) The Company will comply with the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Notes as contemplated in this Agreement and the Prospectus. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(i) above, if during the period in which a prospectus (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to under Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered by an Underwriter or a dealer any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or, if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with law.
     (x) If the General Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Notes at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or to make the statements therein not conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare, file with the Commission (if required) and furnish to the Underwriters and any dealers an appropriate amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the General Disclosure Package so that the General Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or conflict with the Registration Statement then on file, or so that the General Disclosure Package will comply with law.
     (xi) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as it is practicable to do so, but in any event not later than 15 months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement (which need not be audited) in reasonable detail, covering a period of twelve consecutive months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 under the Securities Act.
 
     (xii) The Company will, for a period of five years from the Closing Date, furnish upon request to the Representatives, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to shareholders for such year and the Company will furnish upon request to the Representatives, as soon as available, a copy of each report and any definitive proxy statement of the Company filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act or mailed to stockholders.
     (xiii) The Company will not, during the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing to and including the business day following the Closing Date, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of or guaranteed by the Company which are substantially similar to the Notes without the Representatives' prior written consent.
     (xiv) The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified under the heading "Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus.
     The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and the Indenture, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: the fees incident to the preparation, issuance, execution, authentication and delivery of the Notes, including any expenses of the Trustee; the fees payable to rating agencies in connection with the rating of the Notes; accounting fees of the Company; the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; the cost of printing and delivering to, or as requested by, the Underwriters, copies of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectuses, the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, the Prospectus, this Agreement, the Indenture and any supplements or amendments thereto; the fees incident to the listing of the Notes on any securities exchange; the filing fees of the Commission; and the filing fees and expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) incident to securing any required review by FINRA of the terms of the sale of the Notes. Any transfer taxes imposed on the sale of the Notes to the several Underwriters will be paid by the Company. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of the Underwriters' expenses except that, if this Agreement shall not be consummated because the conditions in Section 7 hereof are not satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Representatives pursuant to Section 6 hereof, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(i)(a) or Section 10(i)(g) hereof, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on its part to be performed, unless such failure to satisfy said condition or to comply with said terms is due to the default or omission of any Underwriter, then the Company shall reimburse the several Underwriters for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing to market the Notes or in contemplation of performing their obligations hereunder, but the Company shall not in any event be liable to any of the several Underwriters for damages on account of loss of anticipated profits from the sale by any of them of the Notes.
5. Costs and Expenses.

     (m) The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and when authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (B) general principles of equity and the limits of specific performance and injunctive relief (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

     In addition, either such counsel or Arnold & Porter LLP, special tax counsel to the Company, will provide an opinion, based on such counsel's own review of the Company's certificate of incorporation, stating that the Company was organized and continues to be organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and, based on such counsel's review of the Company's federal income tax returns and discussions with
 
management and independent public accountants for the Company, that the Company, taking into account operations for its taxable and fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2009, satisfied the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for such years and that its proposed method of operation will enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for its taxable and fiscal year ending December 31, 2010. Furthermore, such counsel shall opine that the statements contained under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, and any amendments thereto and that the statements contained under the heading "Additional U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Prospectus (and any similar sections or information contained in the General Disclosure Package), are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax (i) treatment of the Company and (ii) considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Notes.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters governed by the laws of states other than the laws of the State of Ohio, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware or Federal laws on local counsel in such jurisdictions, provided that in such case such counsel shall state that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying on such other counsel and such other counsel shall indicate that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion. As to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, such counsel may rely on certificates of officers of the Company and public officials so long as such counsel states that they have no reason to believe that either the Underwriters or they are not justified in relying on such certificates. In addition to the matters set forth above, the opinion of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP shall also include a statement to the effect that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which leads them to believe that (a) the Registration Statement, as of the time of its effectiveness for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act and as of the Applicable Time, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (c) the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, as of its date and as of the Closing Date contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements, schedules and other financial data included therein). With respect to such statement, Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP may state that this statement is based upon the procedures set forth or incorporated by reference therein, but is without independent check and verification.
     (iv) The Representatives shall have received from Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion dated the Closing Date with respect to the organization of the Company, the validity of the Indenture and the Notes, the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and other related matters as the Representatives reasonably may request and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.
     (v) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a signed letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, dated the date hereof (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the
 
applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission and (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the General Disclosure Package and containing such other statements and information as is ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings.
     (vi) With respect to the letter of Ernst & Young LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Representatives concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letter"), the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives (the "bring-down letter"), of such accountants, dated the Closing Date, (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters covered by the initial letter and the financial information examined by them and included in the Prospectus and (c) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letter.
     (vii) The Representatives shall have received on the Closing Date a certificate or certificates of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that on and as of the Closing Date, each of them severally represents as follows:
     (a) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or no order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus has been issued, and no proceedings for such purpose have been taken or are, to his knowledge, contemplated by the Commission.
     (b) Subsequent to the delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of (A) any intended or potential downgrading or (B) any review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating, if any, accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the Securities Act.
     (c) He does not know of any litigation instituted or threatened against the Company of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus which is not so disclosed therein or in a document incorporated by reference therein; he does not know of any material contract required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement which is not so filed therein or in a document incorporated by reference therein.
     (d) He has carefully examined the General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus and, in his opinion, as of the Applicable Time, the statements contained in the General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, and such General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing
 
Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, did not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     (e) He has carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in his opinion, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, were true and correct, and such Registration Statement and Prospectus, or any document incorporated by reference therein, did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and, in his opinion, since the effective date of the Registration Statement, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Prospectus which has not been so set forth in such supplement or amendment.
     (f) The representations and warranties of the Company as set forth in this Agreement are true and correct as of the Closing Date as if made on such date. The Company has performed all of its obligations under this Agreement as are to be performed at or before the Closing Date. The representations and warranties made in this clause (f) shall be deemed made by the Company.
          The opinions and certificates mentioned in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in all material respects reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives and to Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriters.
          If any of the conditions hereinabove provided for in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement to be fulfilled, the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notifying the Company of such termination in writing or by telecopy at or prior to the Closing Date. In such event, the Company and the Underwriters shall not be under any obligation to each other (except to the extent provided in Sections 5 and 8 hereof).
     The obligations of the Company to sell and deliver the portion of the Notes required to be delivered as and when specified in this Agreement are subject to the conditions that, at the Closing Date, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and in effect or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened.
7. Conditions of the Obligations of the Company.
     
8. Indemnification.
     (i) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (b) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, and will reimburse each such Underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other
 
expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (ii) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof as described in Section 13 of this Agreement. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have.
     (iii) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing; provided that the failure to so notify will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that the indemnifying party may have on account of the provisions of Sections 8(i) or (ii) or otherwise, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall not have otherwise learned of such proceeding and such failure is materially prejudicial to the indemnifying party. In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event (a) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (b) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit notwithstanding its obligation to bear the fees and expenses of such counsel. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties and one local counsel. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(i) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(ii). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is a party and indemnity was sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the fifth sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent to which the indemnification obligations of the Company hereunder are applicable if (a) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (b) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement (unless the indemnified party is contesting in good faith the amount so reimbursable).
     (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless to the extent required therein an indemnified party under Sections 8(i) or (ii) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters from the offering of the Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(iii) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Underwriters bear to the total proceeds of the offering (the proceeds received by the
 
Underwriters being equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters), in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(iv) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(iv). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(iv) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(iv), (a) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Notes purchased by such Underwriter and (b) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations under this Section 8(iv) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (v) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 8 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon him or it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join him or it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.

9. Notices.
     This Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company as follows:
10. Termination.
     (i) at any time prior to the Closing Date if any of the following has occurred: (a) since the date hereof, any adverse change or any development involving a prospective adverse change in or affecting the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company or the earnings, business affairs, management or business prospects of the Company, whether or not arising in the
 
ordinary course of business, that, in your judgment, is material so as to make the offering or delivery of the Notes impracticable or inadvisable, (b) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or declaration of war or national emergency after the date hereof or other national or international calamity or crisis or change in economic or political conditions if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, emergency, calamity, crisis or change on the financial markets of the United States would, in your judgment, make the offering or delivery of the Notes impracticable or inadvisable, (c) trading in securities generally on the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities or the NASDAQ, or in the Company's securities on the NYSE, shall have been suspended or materially limited (other than limitations on hours or numbers of days of trading) or minimum prices shall have been established for securities on any such exchange, (d) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which in your reasonable opinion materially and adversely affects or will materially or adversely affect the business or operations of the Company, (e) declaration of a banking moratorium by either federal or New York State authorities or material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, (f) any litigation or proceeding is pending or threatened against any Underwriter which seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain, or seeks damages in connection with, or questions the legality or validity of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (g) any downgrading, or the giving of any notice of (1) any intended or potential downgrading or (2) any review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating, if any, accorded to any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; or
     (ii) as provided in Sections 6 and 11 of this Agreement.
     If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date (except in the event of a default on the part of the Company), and the aggregate principal amount of Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is ten percent or less of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives for the purchase of such Notes by other persons (who may include one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, including the Representatives), but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default (except in the event of a default on the part of the Company) occurs is more than ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 11. Any action taken under this Section 11 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
11. Default by Underwriters.
 
     This Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors, executors, administrators, heirs and assigns, and the officers, directors and controlling persons referred to herein, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. The term "successors" shall not include any purchaser of the Notes merely because of such purchase.
12. Successors.
     The Company and the Underwriters acknowledge and agree that the only information furnished or to be furnished by the Underwriters to the Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus consists of the information set forth in the third and seventh through ninth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.
13. Information Provided by Underwriters.
     The reimbursement, indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Agreement and the representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person thereof, or by or on behalf of the Company or its directors or officers and (iii) delivery of and payment for the Notes under this Agreement.
14. Miscellaneous.

The Company further acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm's length basis and in no event do the parties intend that any Underwriter act or be responsible as a fiduciary to the Company, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that any Underwriter may undertake or has undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Company's securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Underwriters hereby expressly disclaim any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Company, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect. The Company and the Underwriters agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions, and that any opinions or views expressed by the Underwriters to the Company regarding such transactions, including but not limited to any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Company's securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Company. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions.
          This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
          This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Company and the Underwriters each submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City and County of New York and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any action or dispute in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

The Notes (together with the Trustee's certificate of authentication)
Title; Aggregate Principal Amount; Form of Notes
 
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, which is hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Supplemental Indenture.
     The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered global securities without coupons ("Global Notes") that will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and registered in the name of DTC's nominee, Cede & Co. Except under the circumstance described below, the Notes will not be issuable in definitive form. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for the individual notes represented thereby, a Global Note may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or by DTC or any nominee of DTC to a successor depositary or any nominee of such successor.
     So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a Global Note, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under this Supplemental Indenture. Except as described below, owners of beneficial interest in Notes evidenced by a Global Note will not be entitled to have any of the individual Notes represented by such Global Note registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of any such Notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders thereof under the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture.
     If DTC is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, the Company will issue individual Notes in exchange for the Global Note or Global Notes representing such Notes. In addition, the Company may at any time and in its sole discretion, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, determine not to have any of such Notes represented by one or more Global Notes and, in such event, will issue individual Notes in exchange for the Global Note or Global Notes representing the Notes. Individual Notes so issued will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.
     (b) . The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.950% per annum, from November 16, 2010 (or, in the case of Notes issued upon the reopening of this series of Notes, from the date designated by the Company in connection with such reopening) or from the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually in arrears on each January 15 and July 15, commencing July 15, 2011 (each of which shall be an "Interest Payment Date"), to the Persons in whose names the Notes are registered in the Security Register at the close of business on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be (whether or not a Business Day), next preceding such Interest Payment Date (each, a "Regular Record Date").
Interest and Interest Rate
     (c) . The stated maturity of the Notes is January 15, 2021, provided, however, the Notes may be earlier redeemed at the option of the Company as provided in paragraph (d) below. The principal of each Note payable on its maturity date shall be paid against presentation and surrender thereof to Corporate Trust Operations of the Trustee, located at 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, NY 13057, in such coin or currency of
Principal Repayment; Currency
 
the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for the payment of public or private debts.
     (d) . The Notes will be subject to redemption at any time at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its address appearing in the Security Register. If the Notes are redeemed more than 90 days prior to maturity, the redemption price will equal the sum of (i) the principal amount of the Notes (or portion of such Notes) being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the applicable Redemption Date, plus (ii) the Make-Whole Amount, if any. If the Notes are redeemed 90 days or fewer prior to the maturity date, the redemption price will equal the principal amount of the Notes (or portion of such Notes) being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the Redemption Date.
Redemption at the Option of the Company
     (e) . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by facsimile.

Section 3.1
     (a) The Company will not pledge or otherwise subject to any Lien, any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries unless the Notes are secured by such pledge or Lien equally and ratably with all other obligations secured thereby so long as such obligations shall be so secured; provided, however, that such restriction shall not apply to the following:
     (i) Liens securing obligations that do not in the aggregate at any one time outstanding exceed 40% of the sum of (i) the Total Assets of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the end of the calendar year or quarter covered in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed with the Commission (or, if such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act, with the Trustee) prior to the incurrence of such additional Liens and (ii) the purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages receivable acquired, and the amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent that such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Indebtedness), by the Company or any Subsidiary since the end of such calendar quarter, including those proceeds obtained in connection with the incurrence of such additional Liens;
     (ii) Pledges or deposits by the Company or its Subsidiaries under workers' compensation laws, unemployment insurance laws, social security laws, or similar legislation, or good faith deposits in connection with bids, tenders, contracts (other than for the payment of Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries), or leases to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or deposits to secure public or statutory obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or deposits of cash or United States Government Bonds to secure surety, appeal, performance or other similar bonds to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or deposits as security for contested taxes or import duties or for the payment of rent;

     (b) The Company will not create, assume, incur, or otherwise become liable in respect of, any Indebtedness if the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is, at the time of such creation, assumption or incurrence and after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent transactions, greater than 60% of the sum of (i) the Total Assets of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the end of the calendar year or quarter covered in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the case may be, most recently filed with the Commission (or, if such filing is not permitted under the Exchange Act, with the Trustee) prior to the incurrence of such additional Indebtedness and (ii) the purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages receivable acquired, and the amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent that such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Indebtedness), by the Company or any Subsidiary since the end of such
 
calendar quarter, including those proceeds obtained in connection with the incurrence of such additional Indebtedness.
     (c) The Company will have or maintain, on a consolidated basis, as of the last day of each of the Company's fiscal quarters, Interest Coverage of not less than 150%.

Exhibit 8
Health Care REIT, Inc. 4500 Dorr Street Toledo, Ohio 43615
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special tax counsel to Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale of $450,000,000 principal amount of 4.950% Notes due 2021 (the "Notes"), pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated November 10, 2010 to the prospectus dated May 7, 2009 (collectively, the "Prospectus") included in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159040) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You have requested our opinion regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement dated November 10, 2010 between the Company and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as Representatives of the Several Underwriters (collectively, not including the Company, the "Underwriters") (the "Agreement"), in connection with the fulfillment of one of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Notes being sold. Certain capitalized terms used herein without definition are as defined in the Agreement.
     In giving this opinion, we have examined the following:
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. November 16, 2010 Page 2
     In connection with the opinions rendered below, we have assumed with your consent that:
     1. Each of the documents referred to above has been duly authorized, executed and delivered; is authentic, if an original, or is accurate, if a copy; and has not been amended;
     2. During its taxable years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2009, the Company has operated, and, in future taxable years, the Company will operate, in a manner that has caused or will make, as the case may be, the factual representations relating to the ownership, operation, future method of operations, and compliance of the Company with the real estate investment trust ("REIT") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury Regulations (the "Regulations") thereunder, as in effect as of the date hereof, contained in a certificate dated on or about the date hereof, and executed by a duly appointed officer of the Company (the "Officer's Certificate"), true for such years;
     3. The Company will not make any amendments to its organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would affect its qualification as a REIT under sections 856-860 of the Code for any taxable year; and
     4. No action will be taken by the Company after the date hereof that would have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinions set forth below are based.
     In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinions rendered below. For the purposes of rendering these opinions, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in any documents delivered to us, including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate. We have relied completely upon the Company's representations that the information presented in such documents accurately reflects all material facts. In the course of our representation of the Company, we have not been made aware of any facts inconsistent with such factual representations. In addition, where such factual representations involve terms defined or
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. November 16, 2010 Page 3
used in the Code, the Regulations, published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") or other relevant authority, we have explained such terms to the Company's representatives and are satisfied that the Company's representatives understand such terms and are capable of making such factual representations.
     Based on the Code, Regulations, documents, assumptions and statements set forth above, the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate and our review of the discussion in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 under the caption "Taxation," and any amendments thereto (and any similar sections or information contained in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus), we are of the opinion that:
     (a) the Company is qualified to be taxed as a REIT pursuant to sections 856 through 860 of the Code for its taxable years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2009, and the Company's organization and current and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for all future taxable years; and
     (b) the statements contained under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and any amendments thereto (and any similar sections or information contained in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus), are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax treatment of the Company and considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Notes.
     We will not review on a continuing basis the Company's compliance with the documents or assumptions set forth above, or the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
     The foregoing opinions are based on current provisions of the Code and the Regulations, published administrative interpretations thereof and published court
