"Health Care REIT creates shareholder value through its relationship investment strategy," commented George L. Chapman, chief executive officer at Health Care REIT, Inc. "We completed $3.2 billion of gross investments in 2010 and announced $1.3 billion to-date in 2011. Of these investments, 90% were originated off-market through long-term industry relationships. Last year alone, we formed new relationships with nine outstanding operators and 14 high-quality health systems. We believe we have built a best-in-industry management team to successfully and profitably integrate these acquisitions. Most important, these investments will create shareholder value through accelerated earnings and dividends growth in 2011 and beyond."

2010 Results
The company reported 2010 normalized FFO of $3.08 per share and normalized FAD of $2.84 per share, versus previous normalized FFO guidance of $3.13 to $3.16 per share and normalized FAD guidance of $2.89 to $2.92 per share.

Please see the exhibits for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO and FAD.

Quarterly Earnings
 
Year End Earnings
 
The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1. FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings. Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1. The company believes that normalized FFO and normalized FAD are useful supplemental measures of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use these measures to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.
Supplemental Reporting Measures
The company's supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance

with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of the supplemental reporting measures.
