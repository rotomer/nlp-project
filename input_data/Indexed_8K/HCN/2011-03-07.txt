The Company reasonably believes that the Acquisition will be consummated in all material respects on the terms and by the date and as contemplated by the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and the Acquisition Agreement.

Such payment and delivery are to be made at the offices of Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, 1400 KeyBank Center, 800 Superior Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44114 at 10:00 a.m. New York time, on March 7, 2011 or at such other time and date thereafter as the Representatives and the Company shall agree upon, such time and date being herein referred to as the "Closing Date." (As used herein, "business day" means a day on which the NYSE is open for trading and on which banks in New York are open for business and not permitted by law or executive order to be closed). The Firm Shares will be delivered by Mellon Investor Services LLC (the "Transfer Agent") in such denominations and in such registrations as the Representatives request in writing not later than the second full business day prior to the Closing Date, and will be delivered through book entry facilities of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and made available for inspection by the Representatives at least one business day prior to the Closing Date at such place as the Representatives, DTC and the Company shall agree.
 
          In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the Underwriters to purchase severally the Option Shares at the price per share as set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 2. The option granted hereby may be exercised in whole or in part by giving notice at any time and from time to time within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, by the Representatives to the Company setting forth the number of Option Shares as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and the time and date at which such Option Shares are to be delivered. The time and date at which the Option Shares are to be delivered shall be determined by the Representatives but shall not be earlier than three nor later than 10 full business days after the exercise of such option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Date (such time and date being herein referred to as the "Option Closing Date"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the option is exercised at least one day prior to the Closing Date, the notice of the exercise shall set the Closing Date as the Option Closing Date. The option with respect to the Option Shares granted hereunder may be exercised only to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Shares by the Underwriters. The Representatives may cancel such option at any time prior to its expiration by giving written notice of such cancellation to the Company. To the extent, if any, that the option is exercised, payment for the Option Shares shall be made by Federal Funds wire transfer to an account designated by the Company for the Option Shares to be sold by the Company against delivery of the Option Shares through the facilities of DTC. Such payment and delivery are to be made at the offices of Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, 1400 KeyBank Center, 800 Superior Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44114, at 10:00 a.m. New York time, on the Option Closing Date. To the extent, if any, that the option is exercised, the Option Shares will be delivered by the Transfer Agent in such denominations and in such registrations as the Representatives request in writing not later than the second full business day prior to the Option Closing Date, and will be delivered through book entry facilities of DTC and made available for inspection by the Representatives at least one business day prior to the Option Closing Date at such place as the Representatives, DTC and the Company shall agree.
     It is understood that the several Underwriters are to make a public offering of the Shares as soon as the Representatives deem it advisable to do so. The Shares are to be initially offered to the public at the price and upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Representatives may from time to time thereafter change the public offering price and other selling terms.

     (ii) The Company will (a) not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission under Rule 433 under the Securities Act unless the Representatives approve its use in writing prior to first use (each, a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus"); provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus(es) included in Schedule III hereto, (b) treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, (c) comply with the requirements of Rules 163, 164 and 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including the requirements relating to timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping and (d) not take any action that would result in an Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that such Underwriter otherwise would not have been required to file thereunder.
     (iii) [Intentionally omitted.]

The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Shares to continue as contemplated in the Registration Statement that was the subject of the notice under Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement relating to the Shares shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.

If the Company is not eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Shares to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement.

     (ix) The Company will comply with the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Shares as contemplated in this Agreement and the Prospectus. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(i) above, if during the period in which a prospectus (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to under Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered by an Underwriter or a dealer any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or, if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with law.
 
     (x) If the General Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Shares at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or to make the statements therein not conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare, file with the Commission (if required) and furnish to the Underwriters and any dealers an appropriate amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the General Disclosure Package so that the General Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or conflict with the Registration Statement then on file, or so that the General Disclosure Package will comply with law.
     (xi) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as it is practicable to do so, but in any event not later than 15 months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement (which need not be audited) in reasonable detail, covering a period of twelve consecutive months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 under the Securities Act.
     (xii) The Company will, for a period of five years from the Closing Date, furnish upon request to the Representatives, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to shareholders for such year and the Company will furnish upon request to the Representatives, as soon as available, a copy of each report and any definitive proxy statement of the Company filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act or mailed to stockholders.
     (xiii) The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified under the heading "Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus.
     (xiv) No offering, sale, other disposition or any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Common Stock or any securities of the Company that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or substantially similar to the Common Stock or on parity with or senior to the Common Stock (with respect to distribution rights or payments upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up) will be made for a period of 30 days after the date of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, by the Company otherwise than hereunder or with the prior written consent of UBS Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, except that the Company may, without such consent, (a) issue securities under the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010; (b) issue shares upon the exercise of options or other stock rights issued pursuant to the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and the Windrose Medical Properties Trust 2002 Stock Incentive Plan; (c) sell shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan filed with the Commission on May 10, 2010; (d) issue shares of Common Stock upon conversion of any 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, 4.75% Convertible Senior

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this paragraph (xiv) shall restrict the Company from completing the offering of the New Preferred Stock contemplated to be conducted concurrently with the offering contemplated by this Agreement.
     The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: the fees incident to the issuance and delivery of the Shares; accounting fees of the Company (accounting fees of FC-GEN Acquisition Holding are to be paid by FC-GEN pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement); the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; the cost of printing and delivering to, or as requested by, the Underwriters, copies of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectuses, the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, the Prospectus, this Agreement, the applicable listing agreement for the NYSE; the filing fees of the Commission; the filing fees and expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) incident to securing any required review by FINRA of the terms of the sale of the Shares; the fees incident to the listing of the Shares on the NYSE and the applicable listing agreement with the NYSE. Any transfer taxes imposed on the sale of the Shares to the several Underwriters will be paid by the Company. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of the Underwriters' expenses except that, if this Agreement shall not be consummated because the conditions in Section 7 hereof are not satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Representatives pursuant to Section 6 hereof, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(i)(a) or Section 10(i)(g) hereof, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on its part to be performed, unless such failure to satisfy said condition or to comply with said terms be due to the default or omission of any Underwriter, then the Company shall reimburse the several Underwriters for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing to market the Shares or in contemplation of performing their obligations hereunder, but the Company shall not in any event be liable to any of the several Underwriters for damages on account of loss of anticipated profits from the sale by any of them of the Shares.

     (i) Such counsel knows of no material legal proceedings pending or threatened against the Company, except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.

     (n) The Company is not, and immediately after the sale of the Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
     (o) Any required filing pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is identified on Schedule III hereto has been made within the time period required by Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act and any required filing of the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424 under the Securities Act.
     In addition, either such counsel or Arnold & Porter LLP, special tax counsel to the Company, will provide an opinion, based on such counsel's own review of the Company's certificate of incorporation, stating that the Company was organized and continues to be organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and, based on such counsel's review of the Company's federal income tax returns and discussions with management and independent public accountants for the Company, that the Company, taking into account operations for its taxable and fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2010, satisfied the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for such years and that its proposed method of operation will enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for its taxable and fiscal year ending December 31, 2011. Furthermore, such counsel shall opine that the statements contained under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and any amendments thereto, are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax (i) treatment of the Company and (ii) considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Common Stock.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters governed by the laws of states other than the laws of the State of Ohio, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware or Federal laws on local counsel in such jurisdictions, provided that in such case such counsel shall state that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying on such other counsel and such other counsel shall indicate that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion. As to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, such counsel may rely on certificates of officers of the Company and public officials so long as such counsel states that they have no reason to believe that either the Underwriters or they are not justified in relying on such certificates. In addition to the matters set forth above, the opinion of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP shall also include a statement to the effect that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which leads them to believe that (a) the Registration Statement, as of the time of its effectiveness for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act and as of the Applicable Time, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
 
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (c) the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, as of its date and as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements, schedules and other financial data included therein). With respect to such statement, Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP may state that this statement is based upon the procedures set forth or incorporated by reference therein, but is without independent check and verification.
     (iv) The Representatives shall have received from Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, on the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, an opinion dated the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, with respect to the organization of the Company, the validity of the Shares, the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and other related matters as the Representatives reasonably may request and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.
     (v) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a signed letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, dated the date hereof (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission and (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the General Disclosure Package and containing such other statements and information as is ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings.
     (vi) With respect to the letter of Ernst & Young LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Representatives concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letter"), the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives (the "bring-down letter"), of such accountants, dated the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters covered by the initial letter and the financial information examined by them and included in the Prospectus and (c) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letter.
     (vii) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from KPMG LLP a signed letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, dated the date hereof (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to FC-GEN Acquisition Holding as required by Rule 101 of the Code of Professional Conduct of the AICPA and (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information of FC-GEN Acquisition Holding examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the General Disclosure Package and containing such other statements and information as is ordinarily
 
included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings.
     (viii) With respect to the letter of KPMG LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Representatives concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letter"), the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives (the "bring-down letter"), of such accountants, dated the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to FC-GEN Acquisition Holding as required by Rule 101 of the Code of Professional Conduct of the AICPA, (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters covered by the initial letter and the financial information examined by them and included in the Prospectus and (c) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letter.
     (ix) The Representatives shall have received on the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, a certificate or certificates of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that on and as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, each of them severally represents as follows:
     (a) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or no order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus has been issued, and no proceedings for such purpose have been taken or are, to his knowledge, contemplated by the Commission.
     (b) Subsequent to the delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of (A) any intended or potential downgrading or (B) any review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating, if any, accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the Securities Act.
     (c) He does not know of any litigation instituted or threatened against the Company of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus which is not so disclosed therein or in a document incorporated by reference therein; he does not know of any material contract required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement which is not so filed therein or in a document incorporated by reference therein.
     (d) He has carefully examined the General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus and, in his opinion, as of the Applicable Time, the statements contained in the General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, and such General Disclosure Package and any individual Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, did not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
     (e) He has carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in his opinion, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, were true and correct, and such Registration Statement and Prospectus, or any document incorporated by reference therein, did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and, in his opinion, since the effective date of the Registration Statement, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Prospectus which has not been so set forth in such supplement or amendment.
     (f) The representations and warranties of the Company as set forth in this Agreement are true and correct as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, as if made on such date. The Company has performed all of its obligations under this Agreement as are to be performed at or before the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be. The representations and warranties made in this clause (f) shall be deemed made by the Company.
     (x) The Representatives shall have received at or prior to the Closing Date, an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, signed by the executive officers of the Company listed on Schedule V hereto (the "Executive Officers") to the effect that they will not, prior to the expiration of 30 days from the date of this Agreement, offer, sell, swap or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock, securities of the Company convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or substantially similar to the Common Stock or on parity with or senior to the Common Stock (with respect to distribution rights or payments upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up), or any securities that the Executive Officers have, or will have, the right to acquire through the exercise of options, warrants, subscription or other rights, without the prior written consent of UBS Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, except (a) pursuant to bona fide gifts, provided that the Company shall have delivered to UBS Securities LLC written consent to such gift, but in no event shall the gifts under this subsection (a) of the Executive Officers exceed 75,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, (b) pursuant to routine dispositions under Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plans entered into by certain Executive Officers prior to or after the date hereof, but in no event shall the dispositions under this subsection (b) of the Executive Officers exceed 300,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, and (c) shares obtained pursuant to the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors, provided that the Company shall have delivered to UBS Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC written consent to such sale, but in no event shall the sales under this subsection (c) of the Executive Officers exceed 500,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate.
     (xi) The Shares to be sold by the Company as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, shall have been duly approved for listing, subject to notice of issuance, on the NYSE.
          The opinions and certificates mentioned in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in all material respects reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives and to Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, counsel for the Underwriters.
 
          If any of the conditions hereinabove provided for in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement to be fulfilled, the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notifying the Company of such termination in writing or by telecopy at or prior to the Closing Date. In such event, the Company and the Underwriters shall not be under any obligation to each other (except to the extent provided in Sections 5 and 8 hereof).
     The obligations of the Company to sell and deliver the portion of the Shares required to be delivered as and when specified in this Agreement are subject to the conditions that at the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and in effect or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened.
7. Conditions of the Obligations of the Company.
     
8. Indemnification.
     (i) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the Securities Act (each, an "Affiliate"), its officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter or such Affiliate, officer, director or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (b) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, and will reimburse each such Underwriter and each such Affiliate, officer, director or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such Affiliate, officer, director or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (ii) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the
 
omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof as described in Section 13 of this Agreement. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have.
     (iii) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing; provided that the failure to so notify will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that the indemnifying party may have on account of the provisions of Sections 8(i) or (ii) or otherwise, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall not have otherwise learned of such proceeding and such failure is materially prejudicial to the indemnifying party. In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event (a) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (b) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit notwithstanding its obligation to bear the fees and expenses of such counsel. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties and one local counsel. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(i) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(ii). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is a party and indemnity was sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
 
written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the fifth sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent to which the indemnification obligations of the Company hereunder are applicable if (a) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (b) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement (unless the indemnified party is contesting in good faith the amount so reimbursable).
     (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless to the extent required therein an indemnified party under Sections 8(i) or (ii) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(iii) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Underwriters bear to the total proceeds of the offering (the proceeds received by the Underwriters being equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters), in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(iv) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(iv). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(iv) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(iv), (a) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Shares purchased by such Underwriter and (b) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
 
Underwriters' obligations under this Section 8(iv) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (v) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 8 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon him or it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join him or it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.

9. Notices.
     This Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company as follows:
10. Termination.
     (i) at any time prior to the Closing Date or any Option Closing Date (if different from the Closing Date and then only as to the Option Shares) if any of the following has occurred: (a) since the date hereof, any adverse change or any development involving a prospective adverse change in or affecting the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company or the earnings, business affairs, management or business prospects of the Company, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, that, in your judgment, is material so as to make the offering or delivery of the Shares impracticable or inadvisable, (b) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or declaration of war or national emergency after the date hereof or other national or international calamity or crisis or change in economic or political conditions if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, emergency, calamity, crisis or change on the financial markets of the United States would, in your judgment, make the offering or delivery of the Shares impracticable or inadvisable, (c) trading in securities generally on the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities or the NASDAQ, or in the Company's securities on the NYSE, shall have been suspended or materially limited (other than limitations on hours or numbers of days of trading) or minimum prices shall have been established for securities on any such exchange, (d) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which in your reasonable opinion materially and adversely affects or will materially or adversely affect the business or operations of the Company, (e) declaration of a banking moratorium by either federal or New York State authorities or material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, (f) any litigation or proceeding is pending or threatened against any Underwriter which seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain, or seeks damages in connection with, or questions the legality or validity of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (g) any
 
downgrading, or the giving of any notice of (1) any intended or potential downgrading or (2) any review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating, if any, accorded to any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; or
     (ii) as provided in Sections 6 and 11 of this Agreement.
     If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date (except in the event of a default on the part of the Company), and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is ten percent or less of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives for the purchase of such Shares by other persons (who may include one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, including the Representatives), but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate number of Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which such default (except in the event of a default on the part of the Company) occurs is more than ten percent of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing or the Option Closing, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 11. Any action taken under this Section 11 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
11. Default by Underwriters.
     This Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors, executors, administrators, heirs and assigns, and the officers, directors and controlling persons referred to herein, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. The term "successors" shall not include any purchaser of the Shares merely because of such purchase.
12. Successors.
     The Company and the Underwriters acknowledge and agree that the only information furnished or to be furnished by the Underwriters to the Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus consists of the information set forth in the third and tenth through sixteenth paragraphs (provided that, with respect to such sixteenth paragraph, only the Underwriter that maintains a website through which information relating to the sale of the Shares is provided shall be deemed to have provided information through such website for purposes of this Section 13 and the information so provided shall be deemed to include only the information contained in such website other than the Prospectus) under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.
13. Information Provided by Underwriters.
 
     The reimbursement, indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Agreement and the representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person thereof, or by or on behalf of the Company or its directors or officers and (iii) delivery of and payment for the Shares under this Agreement.
14. Miscellaneous.
          The Company hereby acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is acting solely as an underwriter in connection with the purchase and sale of the Company's securities. The Company further acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm's length basis and in no event do the parties intend that any Underwriter act or be responsible as a fiduciary to the Company, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that any Underwriter may undertake or has undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Company's securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Underwriters hereby expressly disclaim any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Company, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect. The Company and the Underwriters agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions, and that any opinions or views expressed by the Underwriters to the Company regarding such transactions, including but not limited to any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Company's securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Company. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions.
          This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
          This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Company and the Underwriters each submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York located in the City and County of New York and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any action or dispute in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each of the Company (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates) and the Underwriters waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
 
          If the foregoing letter is in accordance with your understanding of our agreement, please sign and return to us the enclosed duplicates hereof, whereupon it will become a binding agreement among the Company and the Underwriters in accordance with its terms.
 
The foregoing Underwriting Agreement is hereby confirmed and accepted as of the date first above written.

UBS Securities LLC Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith                      Incorporated Barclays Capital Inc. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC Wells Fargo Securities, LLC As Representatives of the Several Underwriters       c/o UBS Securities LLC           299 Park Avenue           New York, New York 10171-0026
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to sell to the underwriters (the "Underwriters") named in Schedule I hereto for whom you are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"), an aggregate of 12,500,000 shares (the "Firm Shares") of the Company's 6.50% Series I Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share (the "Preferred Stock"). The Company also proposes to sell at the Underwriters' option an aggregate of up to 1,875,000 additional shares of the Company's Preferred Stock (the "Option Shares") as set forth below. The Preferred Stock shall be convertible into shares (the "Conversion Shares") of the Company's Common Stock, $1.00 par value per share (the "Common Stock"). The dividend payment dates, conversion provisions, rank and other terms of the Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designation relating to the Preferred Stock (the "Certificate") to be filed with Secretary of State of Delaware (the "Secretary"). It is understood that the Company proposes, and is concurrently entering into an agreement, subject to the terms and conditions stated therein to issue and sell to the underwriters named therein, an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares (or 28,750,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full) of Common Stock. This offering is not conditioned on the completion of the offering of Common Stock and the offering of Common Stock is not conditioned on the completion of this offering.
     As the Representatives, you have advised the Company (a) that you are authorized to enter into this Agreement and (b) that the Underwriters are willing to purchase, acting severally and not jointly, the Firm Shares set forth in Schedule I hereto, plus such Option Shares if the Underwriters elect to exercise the over-allotment option in whole or in part for the account of the Underwriters. The Firm Shares and the Option Shares (to the extent such option is exercised) are herein collectively sometimes referred to as the "Shares."
     The Company has entered into a purchase agreement dated as of February 28, 2011 (the "Acquisition Agreement") among the Company, FC-GEN Investment, LLC ("FC-GEN") and FC-GEN
 
Operations Investment, LLC, pursuant to which the Company will purchase (the "Acquisition") 100% of the equity interests of FC-GEN Acquisition Holding, LLC ("FC-GEN Acquisition Holding"), which indirectly owns senior housing and care facilities.
     In consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein and of the interests of the parties in the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
     The Company represents and warrants to the Underwriters as of the date hereof, as of the Applicable Time (as defined below) and as of the Closing Date (as defined below) as follows:
1. Representations and Warranties of the Company.
     (i) An "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159040) in respect of the Shares and the Conversion Shares, including a form of prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), has been prepared and filed by the Company not earlier than three years prior to the date hereof, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") thereunder (the "Rules and Regulations"). The Company and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement meet the requirements and comply with the conditions for the use of Form S-3. Copies of such registration statement, including any amendments thereto, the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by any preliminary prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus supplement) relating to the Shares and the Conversion Shares filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (a "Preliminary Prospectus"), and including the documents incorporated in the Base Prospectus by reference, and the exhibits, financial statements and schedules to such registration statement, in each case as finally amended and revised, have heretofore been delivered by the Company to the Representatives.

The Company will furnish upon request to the Representatives signed copies of the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto including all exhibits filed therewith.
     (ix) The Company will comply with the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Shares as contemplated in this Agreement and the Prospectus. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(i) above, if during the period in which a prospectus (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to under Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered by an Underwriter or a dealer any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or, if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with law.
     (x) If the General Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Shares at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or to make the statements therein not conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package to comply with any law, the Company promptly will either (a) prepare, file with the Commission (if required) and furnish to the Underwriters and any dealers an appropriate amendment or supplement to the General Disclosure Package or (b) prepare and file with the Commission an appropriate filing under the Exchange Act which shall be incorporated by reference in the General Disclosure Package so that the General Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or conflict with the Registration Statement then on file, or so that the General Disclosure Package will comply with law.
     (xi) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as it is practicable to do so, but in any event not later than 15 months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement (which need not be audited) in reasonable detail, covering a period of twelve consecutive months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 under the Securities Act.
     (xii) The Company will, for a period of five years from the Closing Date, furnish upon request to the Representatives, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to shareholders for such year and the Company will furnish upon request to the

     (xiii) The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified under the heading "Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus.
     (xiv) No offering, sale, other disposition or any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Preferred Stock or Common Stock or any securities of the Company that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or substantially similar to the Preferred Stock or the Common Stock or on parity with or senior to the Preferred Stock or the Common Stock (with respect to distribution rights or payments upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up) will be made for a period of 30 days after the date of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, by the Company otherwise than hereunder or with the prior written consent of UBS Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, except that the Company may, without such consent, (a) issue securities under the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010; (b) issue shares upon the exercise of options or other stock rights issued pursuant to the Company's equity compensation plans for officers, employees, and non-employee directors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and the Windrose Medical Properties Trust 2002 Stock Incentive Plan; (c) sell shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan filed with the Commission on May 10, 2010; (d) issue shares of Common Stock upon conversion of any 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 and 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 outstanding as of the date hereof; (e) issue shares upon conversion of any of the Company's Series H Preferred Stock or the Shares.

     (xv) The Company will use its best efforts to list the Shares and the Conversion Shares, subject to official notice of issuance, on the NYSE and maintain the listing of the Shares and the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion of the Shares on the NYSE. The Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligation to issue Conversion Shares.
     The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: the fees incident to the issuance and delivery of the Shares; accounting fees of the Company (accounting fees of FC-GEN Acquisition Holding are to be paid by FC-GEN pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement); the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; the cost of printing and delivering to, or as requested by, the Underwriters, copies of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectuses, the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, the Prospectus, this Agreement, the applicable listing agreement for the NYSE; the filing fees of the Commission; the filing fees and expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) incident to securing any required review by FINRA of the terms of the sale of the Shares; the fees incident to the listing of the Shares and the Conversion Shares on the NYSE and the applicable listing agreement with the NYSE.

The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of the Underwriters' expenses except that, if this Agreement shall not be consummated because the conditions in Section 7 hereof are not satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Representatives pursuant to Section 6 hereof, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(i)(a) or Section 10(i)(g) hereof, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on its part to be performed, unless such failure to satisfy said condition or to comply with said terms be due to the default or omission of any Underwriter, then the Company shall reimburse the several Underwriters for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing to market the Shares or in contemplation of performing their obligations hereunder, but the Company shall not in any event be liable to any of the several Underwriters for damages on account of loss of anticipated profits from the sale by any of them of the Shares.
     The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Firm Shares on the Closing Date and the Option Shares, if any, on the Option Closing Date are subject to the accuracy, as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, of the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein, and to the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

     (iii) The Representatives shall have received on the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, the opinion of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP, counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, and addressed to the Representatives, as representatives of the several Underwriters, to the effect that:

     (n) The Company is not, and immediately after the sale of the Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
     (o) Any required filing pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is identified on Schedule II hereto has been made within the time period required by Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act and any required filing of the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424 under the Securities Act.
     In addition, either such counsel or Arnold & Porter LLP, special tax counsel to the Company, will provide an opinion, based on such counsel's own review of the Company's certificate of incorporation, stating that the Company was organized and continues to be organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and, based on such counsel's review of the Company's federal income tax returns and discussions with management and independent public accountants for the Company, that the Company, taking into account operations for its taxable and fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2010, satisfied the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for such years and that its proposed method of operation will enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code for its taxable and fiscal year ending December 31, 2011. Furthermore, such counsel shall opine that the statements contained under the caption "Additional U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and any amendments thereto, are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax (i) treatment of the Company and (ii) considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Preferred Stock.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters governed by the laws of states other than the laws of the State of Ohio, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware or Federal laws on local counsel in such jurisdictions, provided that in such case such counsel shall state that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying on such other counsel and such other counsel shall indicate that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion. As to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, such counsel may rely on certificates of officers of the Company and public officials so long as such counsel states that they have no reason to believe that either the Underwriters or they are not justified in relying on such certificates. In addition to the matters set forth above, the opinion of Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP shall also include a statement to the effect that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which leads them to believe that (a) the Registration Statement, as of the time of its effectiveness for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act and as of the Applicable Time, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact
 
or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (c) the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, as of its date and as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements, schedules and other financial data included therein). With respect to such statement, Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP may state that this statement is based upon the procedures set forth or incorporated by reference therein, but is without independent check and verification.
     (iv) The Representatives shall have received from Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, on the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, opinions dated the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, with respect to the organization of the Company, the validity of the Shares, the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and other related matters as the Representatives reasonably may request and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.
     (v) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a signed letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, dated the date hereof (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission and (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the General Disclosure Package and containing such other statements and information as is ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings.
     (vi) With respect to the letter of Ernst & Young LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Representatives concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letter"), the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives (the "bring-down letter"), of such accountants, dated the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Rules and Regulations and the PCAOB and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters covered by the initial letter and the financial information examined by them and included in the Prospectus and (c) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letter.
     (vii) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from KPMG LLP a signed letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, dated the date hereof (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to FC-GEN Acquisition Holding as required by Rule 101 of the Code of Professional Conduct of the AICPA and (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information of FC-GEN Acquisition Holding examined by
 
them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the General Disclosure Package and containing such other statements and information as is ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings.
     (viii) With respect to the letter of KPMG LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Representatives concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letter"), the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives (the "bring-down letter"), of such accountants, dated the Closing Date and the Option Closing Date, if any, (a) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to FC-GEN Acquisition Holding as required by Rule 101 of the Code of Professional Conduct of the AICPA, (b) stating the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters covered by the initial letter and the financial information examined by them and included in the Prospectus and (c) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letter.

state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     (e) He has carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in his opinion, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference therein, were true and correct, and such Registration Statement and Prospectus, or any document incorporated by reference therein, did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and, in his opinion, since the effective date of the Registration Statement, no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Prospectus which has not been so set forth in such supplement or amendment.
     (f) The representations and warranties of the Company as set forth in this Agreement are true and correct as of the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, as if made on such date.

7. Conditions of the Obligations of the Company.
     
8. Indemnification.
     (i) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the Securities Act (each, an "Affiliate"), its officers and directors, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter or such Affiliate, officer, director or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (b) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, and will reimburse each such Underwriter and each such Affiliate, officer, director or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such Affiliate, officer, director or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (ii) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become
 
subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, or in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof as described in Section 13 of this Agreement. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have.
     (iii) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 8, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing; provided that the failure to so notify will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that the indemnifying party may have on account of the provisions of Sections 8(i) or (ii) or otherwise, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall not have otherwise learned of such proceeding and such failure is materially prejudicial to the indemnifying party. In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event (a) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (b) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit notwithstanding its obligation to bear the fees and expenses of such counsel. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties and one local counsel. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(i) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(ii). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or
 
proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is a party and indemnity was sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the fifth sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent to which the indemnification obligations of the Company hereunder are applicable if (a) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (b) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement (unless the indemnified party is contesting in good faith the amount so reimbursable).
     (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless to the extent required therein an indemnified party under Sections 8(i) or (ii) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(iii) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Underwriters bear to the total proceeds of the offering (the proceeds received by the Underwriters being equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters), in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(iv) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(iv). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(iv) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably
 
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(iv), (a) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Shares purchased by such Underwriter and (b) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations under this Section 8(iv) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (v) In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 8 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon him or it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join him or it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.

9. Notices.
     This Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company as follows:
10. Termination.
     (i) at any time prior to the Closing Date or any Option Closing Date (if different from the Closing Date and then only as to the Option Shares) if any of the following has occurred: (a) since the date hereof, any adverse change or any development involving a prospective adverse change in or affecting the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company or the earnings, business affairs, management or business prospects of the Company, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, that, in your judgment, is material so as to make the offering or delivery of the Shares impracticable or inadvisable, (b) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or declaration of war or national emergency after the date hereof or other national or international calamity or crisis or change in economic or political conditions if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, emergency, calamity, crisis or change on the financial markets of the United States would, in your judgment, make the offering or delivery of the Shares impracticable or inadvisable, (c) trading in securities generally on the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities or the NASDAQ, or in the Company's securities on the NYSE, shall have been suspended or materially limited (other than limitations on hours or numbers of days of trading) or minimum prices shall have been established for securities on any such exchange, (d) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any federal or state statute, regulation,
 
rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which in your reasonable opinion materially and adversely affects or will materially or adversely affect the business or operations of the Company, (e) declaration of a banking moratorium by either federal or New York State authorities or material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, (f) any litigation or proceeding is pending or threatened against any Underwriter which seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain, or seeks damages in connection with, or questions the legality or validity of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (g) any downgrading, or the giving of any notice of (1) any intended or potential downgrading or (2) any review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating, if any, accorded to any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; or
     (ii) as provided in Sections 6 and 11 of this Agreement.
     If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date (except in the event of a default on the part of the Company), and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is ten percent or less of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters may make arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives for the purchase of such Shares by other persons (who may include one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, including the Representatives), but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate number of Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which such default (except in the event of a default on the part of the Company) occurs is more than ten percent of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing or the Option Closing, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 11. Any action taken under this Section 11 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
11. Default by Underwriters.
     This Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Company and their respective successors, executors, administrators, heirs and assigns, and the officers, directors and controlling persons referred to herein, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. The term "successors" shall not include any purchaser of the Shares merely because of such purchase.
12. Successors.
     The Company and the Underwriters acknowledge and agree that the only information furnished or to be furnished by the Underwriters to the
13. Information Provided by Underwriters.
 
Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus consists of the information set forth in the third and tenth through sixteenth paragraphs (provided that, with respect to such sixteenth paragraph, only the Underwriter that maintains a website through which information relating to the sale of the Shares is provided shall be deemed to have provided information through such website for purposes of this Section 13 and the information so provided shall be deemed to include only the information contained in such website other than the Prospectus) under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.
     The reimbursement, indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Agreement and the representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person thereof, or by or on behalf of the Company or its directors or officers and (iii) delivery of and payment for the Shares under this Agreement.
14. Miscellaneous.
          The Company hereby acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is acting solely as an underwriter in connection with the purchase and sale of the Company's securities. The Company further acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm's length basis and in no event do the parties intend that any Underwriter act or be responsible as a fiduciary to the Company, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that any Underwriter may undertake or has undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Company's securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Underwriters hereby expressly disclaim any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Company, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company hereby confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect. The Company and the Underwriters agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions, and that any opinions or views expressed by the Underwriters to the Company regarding such transactions, including but not limited to any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Company's securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Company. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions.
          This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
          This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Company and the Underwriters each submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York located in the City and County of New York and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any action or dispute in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each of the Company (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates) and the Underwriters waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
 
          If the foregoing letter is in accordance with your understanding of our agreement, please sign and return to us the enclosed duplicates hereof, whereupon it will become a binding agreement among the Company and the Underwriters in accordance with its terms.
 
The foregoing Underwriting Agreement is hereby confirmed and accepted as of the date first above written.

Dividends
     (A) The Holders of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof), out of funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative preferential cash dividends at the rate of 6.50% of the Liquidation Preference per annum per share (equivalent to $3.25 per share per annum).
     (B) Dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock shall be cumulative from the most recent date to which dividends have been paid, or if no dividends have been paid, from the Issue Date and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year or, if not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day commencing July 15,
 
2011 (each, a "Dividend Payment Date"). Any dividend payable on the Series I Preferred Stock for any partial dividend period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends will be payable to Holders as they appear in the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the last day of the calendar month first preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date (each, a "Dividend Record Date").
     (C) No dividends on shares of the Series I Preferred Stock shall be declared by the Board or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation if such declaration or payment is restricted or prohibited by law.
     (D) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 5(C), dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock will accrue whether or not the Corporation has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not such dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock will not bear interest and Holders will not be entitled to any dividends in excess of the full cumulative dividends described above. Any dividend payment made on the Series I Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares that remains payable.
     (E) If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to designate as "capital gain dividends" (as defined in Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) any portion (the "Capital Gains Amount") of the dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of stock (the "Total Dividends"), then the portion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to the Holders shall be the amount that the total dividends (as determined for federal income tax purposes) paid or made available to the Holders for the year bears to the Total Dividends. The Corporation will make a similar allocation for each taxable year with respect to any undistributed long-term capital gains of the Corporation that are to be included in its stockholders' long-term capital gains, based on the allocation of the Capital Gains Amount that would have resulted if such undistributed long-term capital gains had been distributed as "capital gains dividends" by the Corporation to its stockholders.
     (F) No dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock) and cash in lieu of fractional shares) will be declared, made or paid or set apart for payment on any Parity Stock or Junior Stock, nor may any Parity Stock or Common Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Parity Stock or Junior Stock) by the Corporation or on its behalf (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock)) unless full Accumulated Dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment on the Series I Preferred Stock and any Dividend Parity Stock for all dividend periods ending on or prior to the date of such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or acquisition; provided, that the foregoing restriction will not limit the acquisition of shares of Common Stock solely to the
 
extent necessary to preserve the Corporation's qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust (a "REIT").
     (G) Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 5(F), when dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series I Preferred Stock and Dividend Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series I Preferred Stock and Dividend Parity Stock may be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series I Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that Accumulated Dividends per share on the Series I Preferred Stock and accumulated dividends on such other series of Dividend Parity Stock (which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such Dividend Parity Stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other.
     (H) The Holders at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payment on those shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of such shares following that Dividend Record Date or the Corporation's default in payment of the dividend due on that Dividend Payment Date. However, shares of Series I Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion at the option of a Holder pursuant to Section 7 during the period between the close of business on any Dividend Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount of cash equal to the dividend payable on such shares on that Dividend Payment Date. A Holder on a Dividend Record Date that surrenders (or whose transferee surrenders) any shares for conversion on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall receive the dividend payable by the Corporation on the Series I Preferred Stock on that date, and the converting Holder need not include payment in the amount of such dividend upon surrender of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock for conversion. Except as provided in Section 8 and Section 11, the Corporation shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on converted shares or for dividends on the shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion.
     Section 6. .
Liquidation Preference
     (A) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation, the Holders shall be entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its stockholders the Liquidation Preference, plus an amount equal to any Accumulated Dividends and Accrued Dividends to the date of payment, before any payment or distribution of assets is made to holders of the Junior Stock. Upon the payment in full of such liquidation preference and all such Accumulated Dividends and Accrued Dividends, the Holders will have no right or claim to any remaining assets of the Corporation.
     (B) If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the Holders shall be insufficient to permit payment in full to such Holders the sums that such Holders are entitled to receive in such case, then all of the assets available for distribution to the Holders shall be distributed among and paid to the Holders ratably in proportion to the respective amounts that would be payable to such Holders if such assets were sufficient to permit payment in full;
 
provided that all such distributions and payments to the Holders shall be made on a basis with the holders of shares of the Parity Stock.
pari passu
     (C) For the purposes of this Section 6, the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation, or the voluntary sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation.
     (D) The Corporation shall provide the Holders with notice of any event triggering the right to receive a distribution upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation not less than 30 calendar days nor more than 60 calendar days prior to the applicable distribution payment date.
     Section 7. .
Conversion
     (A) Each Holder shall have the right, at any time, at its option, to convert, subject to the terms and provisions of this Section 7(A), any or all of such Holder's shares of Series I Preferred Stock into such whole number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock per share of converted Series I Preferred Stock as is equal, subject to Section 7(H), to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date.
     (B) The conversion right of a Holder shall be exercised by the Holder by the surrender to the Corporation of the certificates representing shares to be converted at any time during usual business hours at its principal place of business or the offices of its duly appointed Transfer Agent to be maintained by it, accompanied by (i) written notice to the Corporation in the form of Exhibit B hereto that the Holder elects to convert all or a portion of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock represented by such certificate and specifying the name or names (with address) in which a certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued, (ii) (if so required by the Corporation or its duly appointed Transfer Agent) a written instrument or instruments of transfer and endorsements in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation or its duly appointed Transfer Agent duly executed by the Holder or its duly authorized legal representative and transfer tax stamps or funds therefor, if required pursuant to Section 7(J), (iii) funds for the payment of any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Corporation and (iv) any payment required pursuant to Section 5(H). The Corporation will deliver a stock certificate or certificates representing the shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with a conversion, together with, if applicable, any payment of cash dividends and cash in lieu of fractional shares, to the Holder, or in the case of Series I Preferred Stock held in global certificates, the Transfer Agent will deliver the shares of Common Stock by a book-entry transfer through DTC. Such delivery will be made as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than three Business Days following the Conversion Date.
     (C) As of the close of business on the Conversion Date with respect to a conversion, a converting Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Holder's Series I Preferred Stock notwithstanding that the share register of the Corporation shall then be closed or that certificates representing such Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such Holder. On the Conversion Date, all rights with respect to the shares of Series I Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices,
 
will terminate, except only the rights of the Holders thereof to (i) receive the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series I Preferred Stock have been converted (with such adjustment or cash payment for fractional shares as the Corporation may elect pursuant to Section 14); (ii) receive a Make-Whole Premium or any other shares of Common Stock or other consideration, if any, payable upon a Fundamental Change, in accordance with Section 11 and Section 12; (iii) receive Reference Property, if any, issuable pursuant to Section 7(H) in lieu of Common Stock upon conversion; and (iv) exercise the rights to which they are thereafter entitled as holders of Common Stock and/or any other property receivable by the Holder upon such conversion. Prior to the close of business on the Conversion Date, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose and the Holders will have no rights with respect to such Common Stock, including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock, by virtue of holding shares of the Series I Preferred Stock.
     (D) The Conversion Rate shall be subject to the following adjustments (except as provided in Section 7(E)), without duplication:
     (i) If the Corporation issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Corporation effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     where,
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or the open of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be;
0
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or the open of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be;
1
          OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or the open of business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be; and
0
          OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution, or such share split or share combination, as the case may be.
1
     Any adjustment made under this Section 7(D)(i) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the effective date for such share split or share combination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 7(D)(i) is declared but not so paid or made, or any share split or combination of the type described in this Section 7(D)(i) is announced but the
 
outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or not to split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination had not been declared or announced.
     (ii) If the Corporation distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them, for a period expiring not more than 60 days immediately following the record date of such distribution, to purchase or subscribe for shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
     where,
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution;
0
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution;
1
          OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution;
0
          X = the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; and
          Y = the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants divided by the average of the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution.
     Any increase made under this Section 7(D)(ii) will be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are distributed and shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the distribution of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Ex-Date for such distribution had not occurred.
 
     In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such average of the Daily VWAP for the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of the Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Corporation for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board in its good faith judgment.
     (iii) If the Corporation distributes shares of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other assets, securities or property, to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, excluding: (A) dividends or distributions referred to in Sections 7(D)(i) and 7(D)(ii); (B) Spin-Offs to which the provisions set forth in the latter portion of this Section 7(D)(iii) shall apply; and (C) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash referred to in Section 7(D)(iv), then the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
     where,
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution;
0
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution;
1
          SP = the average of the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution; and
0
          FMV = the fair market value (as determined by the Board in its good faith judgment) of the shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, securities or property distributable with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock on the Ex-Date for such distribution.
     If "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than the "SP" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive in respect of each share of the Series I Preferred Stock owned by it, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock, the amount and kind of the Corporation's capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, other assets, securities or property that such Holder would have received as if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Ex-Date for the distribution.
0
     Any increase made under the foregoing portion of this Section 7(D)(iii) will become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution.
 
     With respect to an adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(D)(iii) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit where such capital stock or similar equity interest is listed or quoted (or will be listed or quoted upon consummation of the spin-off) on a national securities exchange (a "Spin-Off"), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off will be increased based on the following formula:
     where,
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off;
0
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off;
1
          FMV = the average of the volume-weighted average sale prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of the Common Stock applicable to one share of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off; and
          MP = the average of the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off.
0
     The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph will occur at the close of business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off; provided that, for purposes of determining the Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the 10 Trading Days following, and including, the effective date of any Spin-Off, references within the portion of this Section 7(D)(iii) related to Spin-Offs to 10 consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days as have elapsed between the effective date of such Spin-Off and the relevant Conversion Date.
     If the dividend or distribution described in this Section 7(D)(iii) is declared but not so paid or made, the new Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     (iv) If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock (excluding any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation) during any quarterly fiscal period of the Corporation in an aggregate amount that, together with other cash dividends or distributions made during such quarterly fiscal period, exceeds the product of $0.715 (the "Reference
 
Dividend"), multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for such distributions, the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
     where,
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution;
0
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution;
1
          SP = the average of the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution; and
0
          C = the amount in cash per share of Common Stock distributed to holders of the Common Stock that exceeds the Reference Dividend.
     Such increase shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder shall receive in respect of each share of Series I Preferred Stock owned by it, at the same time as the holders of Common Stock receive the applicable dividend or other distribution, an amount of cash equal to C multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Ex-Date for such cash dividend or distribution.

     The Reference Dividend shall be adjusted in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments made to the Conversion Rate; provided that no adjustment will be made to the Reference Dividend amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate under this Section 7(D)(iv).
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an adjustment is required to be made under this Section 7(D)(iv) as a result of a distribution that is not a regular quarterly dividend, the Reference Dividend amount will be deemed to be zero.
     (v) If the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock, if the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the average of the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges
 
may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
     where,
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the last Trading Day of the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
0
          CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the close of business on the last Trading Day of the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
1
          AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined in good faith by the Board) paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer;
          OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
0
          OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to such tender offer or exchange offer and excluding fractional shares); and
1
          SP = the average of the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
1
     The increase to the Conversion Rate under this Section 7(D)(v) will occur at the close of business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, but excluding, the date such tender or exchange offer expires; provided that, for purposes of determining the Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the 10 Trading Days immediately following, but excluding, the date that any such tender or exchange offer expires, references within this Section 7(D)(v) to 10 consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days as have elapsed between the date such tender or exchange offer expires and the relevant conversion date.
     (vi) If the Corporation issues rights, options or warrants that are only exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events (each a "Trigger Event"), then the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted pursuant to Section 7(D)(ii) or Section 7(D)(iii), as applicable, until the earliest Trigger Event occurs, and the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the extent any of these rights, options or warrants are not exercised before they expire.
 
     (vii) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7(D) to the contrary, if a Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective pursuant to the any of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this Section 7(D) on any Ex-Date as described above, and a Holder that converts its Series I Preferred Stock on or after such Ex-Date and on or prior to the related record date would be treated as the record holder of shares of Common Stock as of the related Conversion Date set forth in Section 7(B) based on an adjusted Conversion Rate for such Ex-Date, then, notwithstanding the foregoing Conversion Rate adjustment provisions, the Conversion Rate adjustment relating to such Ex-Date will not be made for such converting Holder. Instead, such Holder will be treated as if such Holder were the record owner of the shares of Common Stock on an un-adjusted basis and participate in the related dividend, distribution or other event giving rise to such adjustment.
     (viii) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7(D) to the contrary, no adjustment under this Section 7(D) need be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate then in effect. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1% of such Conversion Rate; provided that on the date of an optional conversion (including any conversion in connection with a Fundamental Change) or the date of a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 8, adjustments to the Conversion Rate will be made with respect to any such adjustment carried forward that has not been taken into account before such date. In addition, at the end of each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted to give effect to any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, and such adjustments will no longer be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. Adjustments to the Conversion Rate will be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share.
     (ix) To the extent permitted by law and the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, the Corporation may, from time to time, increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days or any longer period permitted or required by law, so long as the increase is irrevocable during that period and the Board determines that the increase is in the Corporation's best interests. The Corporation will mail a notice of the increase to registered Holders at least 15 calendar days before the day the increase commences. In addition, the Corporation may, but is not obligated to, increase the Conversion Rate as it determines to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish taxes to recipients of certain distributions.
     (x) To the extent that the Corporation has a stockholder rights plan or agreement (i.e., a "poison pill") in effect upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock, the Holders will receive, upon a conversion of such shares of Series I Preferred Stock, in addition to Common Stock, rights under the stockholder rights plan or agreement with respect to the Common Stock received upon conversion unless, prior to conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock. If the rights provided for in any rights plan or agreement that the Board has adopted have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights plan or agreement so that the Holders would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of the shares of Common Stock that the Corporation delivers upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had
 
distributed to all holders of Common Stock evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property pursuant to Section 7(D)(iii), subject to readjustment upon the subsequent expiration, termination or redemption of the rights.
     (E) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7(D), no adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made with respect to any transaction described in Section 7(D) (other than for share splits or share combinations) if the Corporation makes provision for each Holder to participate in the transaction, at the same time as holders of the Common Stock participate, without conversion, as if such Holder held a number of shares of Common Stock in respect of each share of Series I Preferred Stock held by such Holder equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Ex-Date or effective date.
     (F) The Conversion Rate will not be adjusted: (i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Corporation's securities; (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock, restricted stock or restricted stock units, nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options or any other options or rights (including stock appreciation rights) to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of, or assumed by, the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described above in clause (ii) of this Section 7(F) and outstanding as of the Issue Date; (iv) for Accrued Dividends, if any; (v) for Accumulated Dividends, if any; (vi) upon the repurchase of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to an open-market share repurchase program or other buy-back transaction that is not a tender offer or exchange offer; or (vii) for a change in the par value of shares of the Common Stock.
     (G) The Corporation shall not take any action that would require an adjustment to the Conversion Rate such that the Conversion Price, as adjusted to give effect to such action, would be less than the then applicable par value per share of the Common Stock, except that the Corporation may undertake a share split or similar event if such share split results in a corresponding reduction in the par value per share of the Common Stock such that the as-adjusted new Conversion Price per share would not be below the new as-adjusted par value per share of the Common Stock following such share split or similar transaction and the Conversion Rate is adjusted as provided under Section 7(D)(i) and any other provision of Section 7(D). The Corporation also shall not take any action that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate in a manner that does not comply with any applicable stockholder approval rules of the NYSE or any other stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed at the relevant time.
     (H) In the case of any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock (other than changes resulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification described in Section 7(D)(i)), a consolidation, merger or combination involving the Corporation, a sale, lease or other transfer to a third party of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation (or the Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis), or any statutory share exchange, in each case as a result of which the Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) (any of the foregoing, a "Transaction"), then, at the effective time of the Transaction, the right to
 
convert each share of Series I Preferred Stock will be changed into a right to convert such Series I Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) (the "Reference Property") that a Holder would have received in respect of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of the Series I Preferred Stock immediately prior to such Transaction. If a Transaction also constitutes a Fundamental Change, a Holder who converts its shares of Series I Preferred Stock in connection with such Fundamental Change will, if applicable, also be entitled to receive additional shares of Common Stock in connection with such conversion as described in Section 11, in which case the converting Holder would also receive Reference Property in lieu of such additional shares of Common Stock. In the event that holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Transaction, the Corporation shall make adequate provision whereby the Holders shall have a reasonable opportunity to determine the form of consideration into which all of the shares of the Series I Preferred Stock, treated as a single class, shall be convertible from and after the effective date of the Transaction. Such determination shall be based on the weighted average of elections made by the Holders who participate in such determination, shall be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Stock are subject, such as pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Transaction, and shall be conducted in such a manner as to be completed by the date which is the earliest of (a) the deadline for elections to be made by holders of Common Stock and (b) two Business Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Transaction. The provisions of this Section 7(H) and any equivalent thereof in any such securities similarly shall apply to successive Transactions. The Corporation shall not become a party to any Transaction unless its terms are consistent with the foregoing.
     (I) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock such number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock, and shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock if at any time there shall be insufficient unissued shares of Common Stock to permit such reservation or to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock.
     (J) The issuance or delivery of certificates for Common Stock upon the conversion of shares of Series I Preferred Stock or the payment or partial payment of a dividend on Series I Preferred Stock in Common Stock shall be made without charge to the converting Holder or recipient of shares of Series I Preferred Stock for such certificates or for any tax in respect of the issuance or delivery of such certificates or the securities represented thereby, and such certificates shall be issued or delivered in the respective names of, or in such names as may be directed by, the Holders of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock converted; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate in a name other than that of the Holder of the shares of the relevant Series I Preferred Stock and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificate unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance or delivery thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.
 
     (K) Upon any increase or decrease in the Conversion Rate, then, and in each such case, the Corporation promptly shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Transfer Agent a certificate signed by an Officer, setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated and specifying the increased or decreased Conversion Rate then in effect following such adjustment (which certificate shall, upon request, be made available by the Transfer Agent to any Holder or beneficial owner of Series I Preferred Stock).
     (L) Any Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to list the Common Stock required to be delivered upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock, prior to such delivery, upon each national securities exchange, if any, upon which the outstanding Common Stock is listed at the time of such delivery.
     Section 8. .
Mandatory Conversion
     (A) At any time on or after April 20, 2018, the Corporation shall have the right, at its option, to cause the Series I Preferred Stock, in whole but not in part, to be automatically converted into a number of shares of Common Stock for each share of Series I Preferred Stock equal to the Conversion Rate then in effect. The Corporation may exercise its right to cause a mandatory conversion pursuant to this Section 8(A) only if the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock equals or exceeds 130% of the then prevailing Conversion Price for at least 20 Trading Days in a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days, including the last Trading Day of such 30-day period, ending on the Trading Day prior to the Corporation's issuance of a press release announcing the mandatory conversion as described in Section 8(B).
     (B) To exercise the mandatory conversion right described in Section 8(A), the Corporation must issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones News Service or Bloomberg Business News (or if either such service is not available, another broadly disseminated news or press release service selected by the Corporation) prior to the opening of business on the first Trading Day following any date on which the conditions described in Section 8(A) are met, announcing such a mandatory conversion. The Corporation shall also give notice by mail or by publication (with subsequent prompt notice by mail) to the Holders (not more than four Business Days after the date of the press release) of the mandatory conversion announcing the Corporation's intention to convert the Series I Preferred Stock. In the event of a mandatory conversion, the applicable Conversion Date (the "Mandatory Conversion Date") will be the date that is five Trading Days after the date on which the Corporation issues the press release described in this Section 8(B).
     (C) In addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, the press release and notice of a mandatory conversion described in Section 8(B) shall state, as appropriate: (i) the Mandatory Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Series I Preferred Stock; and (iii) that dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock to be converted will cease to accrue on the Mandatory Conversion Date.
 
     (D) On and after the Mandatory Conversion Date, dividends shall cease to accrue on the Series I Preferred Stock called for a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 8(A) and all rights of the Holders of such Series I Preferred Stock shall terminate except for the right to receive the whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof. The dividend payment with respect to the Series I Preferred Stock called for a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 8(A) on a date during the period between the close of business on any Dividend Record Date to the close of business on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall be payable on such Dividend Payment Date to the Holder of such share on such Dividend Record Date if such share has been converted after such Dividend Record Date and prior to such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no payment or adjustment will be made upon mandatory conversion of any shares of Series I Preferred Stock for Accumulated Dividends or Accrued Dividends or for dividends with respect to the Common Stock issued upon such conversion.
     (E) The Corporation may not authorize or give notice of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 8(A) unless, prior to giving the conversion notice, all Accumulated Dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock for all quarterly dividend periods ending on or prior to the date on which it gives such notice shall have been paid.
     (F) In addition to the mandatory conversion right described in Section 8(A), if there are fewer than 1,250,000 shares of Series I Preferred Stock outstanding, the Corporation shall have the right, at any time on or after April 20, 2018 at its option, to cause all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into that number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the greater of (i) the then prevailing Conversion Rate and (ii) the Liquidation Preference divided by the Market Value of the Common Stock as determined on the second Trading Day immediately prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date. The provisions of clauses (B) (other than the requirements relating to the conditions in Section 8(A)), (C), (D) and (E) of this Section 8 shall apply to any mandatory conversion pursuant to this clause (F); provided, however, that (a) the Mandatory Conversion Date described in Section 8(B) shall not be less than 15 calendar days nor more than 30 calendar days after the date on which the Corporation issues a press release pursuant to Section 8(B) announcing such mandatory conversion and (b) the press release and notice of mandatory conversion described in Section 8(C) need not state the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Series I Preferred Stock.
     Section 9. . The Series I Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable by the Corporation. Subject to applicable law, the Corporation may purchase shares of Series I Preferred Stock in the open market, by tender or by private agreement. Any shares of Series I Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation will be retired and reclassified as authorized but unissued shares of the Preferred Stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter be reissued as any class or series of the Preferred Stock.
Redemption and Retirement
     Section 10. .
Voting Rights
     (A) The Holders of the Series I Preferred Stock shall not have any relative, participating, optional or other voting rights except as set forth in this Section 10 or as otherwise required by law.
 
     (B) Whenever dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors then constituting the Board will increase by two (if not already increased by reason of a similar arrearage with respect to any Parity Voting Preferred) and the Holders (voting separately as a class with holders of all Parity Voting Preferred) will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors of the Corporation (the "Preferred Stock Directors") at a special meeting called by the Holders of at least 25% of the Series I Preferred Stock or by holders of any such other series of Parity Voting Preferred (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual meeting of stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on the Series I Preferred Stock for the past dividend periods and the dividend for the then current dividend period either have been fully paid or have been declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment. The voting rights set forth in this Section 10(B) and the terms of the Preferred Stock Directors will continue until such time as the dividend arrearage on the Series I Preferred Stock has been paid in full and the dividend for the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment. Upon the termination of such voting rights, the term of office for any Preferred Stock Directors will terminate and the size of the Board will decrease accordingly. The voting rights provided by this Section 10(B) will re-vest in the event that dividends on any Series I Preferred Stock are once again in arrears for six or more quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive).
     (C) The Preferred Stock Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election for a one-year term, and each Preferred Stock Director will serve until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies or until the director's right to hold the office terminates, whichever occurs earlier. If there is a vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director, then the vacancy may only be filled by a vote of the Holders of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting separately as a class with all series of Parity Voting Preferred). Each Preferred Stock Director will be entitled to one vote (two votes in the aggregate for the Preferred Stock Directors) on any matter with respect to which the Board votes.
     (D) Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting separately as a class with all series of Parity Voting Preferred).
     (E) So long as any shares of Series I Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote of the Holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock outstanding at the time given in person or by proxy at a meeting (such Series I Preferred Stock voting separately as a class) (i) authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any Senior Stock, or reclassify any authorized stock of the Corporation into Senior Stock, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any Senior Stock or (ii) repeal, amend, or otherwise change any provisions of the Certificate of Designation or the Certificate of Incorporation in any manner (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) that adversely affects the powers, preferences, or other special rights or privileges of the Series I Preferred Stock or its Holders; provided, however, that increases in the amount of the authorized Preferred
 
Stock, the creation or issuance of other series of Parity Stock or Junior Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock will not require the consent of the Holders of Series I Preferred Stock and shall not be deemed to adversely affect such powers, preferences, or other special rights or privileges.
     (F) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10(E), in the event of a merger or consolidation involving the Corporation, a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or of the Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or a statutory share exchange (any such transaction, an "Extraordinary Transaction"), so long as: (i) the Series I Preferred Stock remains outstanding following consummation of such Extraordinary Transaction with its terms materially unchanged, taking into account that, upon the occurrence of such an Extraordinary Transaction, the Corporation may not be the surviving entity (in which case, the Series I Preferred Stock may be converted into or exchanged for preferred stock of the surviving entity having terms materially the same as the Series I Preferred Stock) and, if applicable, with any changes to the terms of the Series I Preferred Stock required pursuant to and made in compliance with the provisions of Section 7(H) in connection with such Extraordinary Transaction and (ii) if such transaction also constitutes a Fundamental Change, the provisions of Section 11 are complied with in connection with such Extraordinary Transaction, then the occurrence of such Extraordinary Transaction shall not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, or other special rights or privileges of the Series I Preferred Stock or its Holders and in such case such Holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the occurrence of such Extraordinary Transaction pursuant to Section 10(E)(ii).
     (G) In all cases in which the Holders shall be entitled to vote, each share of Series I Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote, unless the outstanding Parity Voting Preferred has similar vested and continuing voting rights, in which case the number of votes that each share of Series I Preferred Stock and any Parity Voting Preferred participating in the votes described above shall have shall be one vote for each $25.00 of liquidation preference.
     Section 11. .
Special Rights Upon a Fundamental Change
     (A) The Corporation must give notice (a "Fundamental Change Notice") of each Fundamental Change to all Holders, by the later of 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Fundamental Change Effective Date (determined in good faith by the Board) of the Fundamental Change and the first public disclosure by the Corporation of the anticipated Fundamental Change. In addition, the Corporation must give notice announcing the Fundamental Change Effective Date and other matters specified pursuant to Section 12(E).
     (B) If a Holder converts its shares of Series I Preferred Stock at any time beginning at the opening of business on the Trading Day immediately following the Fundamental Change Effective Date in respect of such Fundamental Change and ending at the close of business on the 30th Trading Day immediately following such Fundamental Change Effective Date (the "Fundamental Change Expiration Date"), the Holder shall automatically receive, with respect to each converted share of Series I Preferred Stock, the greater of:
     (i) the sum of (a) a number of shares of Common Stock, as calculated pursuant to Section 7(A) and (b) the Make-Whole Premium, if any, pursuant to Section 12; and
 
     (ii) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the lesser of (a) the Liquidation Preference divided by the Market Value of the Common Stock as of the Fundamental Change Effective Date and (B) 2.0305 (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 7(D)).
     In addition to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each share of Series I Preferred Stock at the option of the Holder on any Conversion Date during the period referred to in the previous sentence, each converting Holder will have the right to receive an amount equal to all Accumulated Dividends and Accrued Dividends on such converted shares of Series I Preferred Stock, whether or not declared prior to that date, for all prior dividend periods ending on or prior to the Dividend Payment Date immediately preceding (or, if applicable, ending on) the Conversion Date (other than previously declared dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock payable to Holders of record as of a prior date), provided that the Corporation is then legally permitted to pay such dividends. The amount payable in respect of such dividends will be paid in cash.
     (C) In lieu of issuing the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion pursuant to Section 11(B), the Corporation may, at its option, make a cash payment equal to the Market Value determined for the period ending on the Fundamental Change Effective Date for each such share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon conversion.
     (D) On or before the Fundamental Change Expiration Date, each Holder wishing to exercise its conversion right pursuant to this Section 11 shall comply with the procedures specified in Section 7(B).
     Section 12. .
Determination of the Make-Whole Premium
     (A) Subject to the limitations and requirements of Section 11 and this Section 12, if a Holder elects to convert its shares of Series I Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Rate will be increased by the number of shares set forth in the table below (the "Additional Shares" or "Make-Whole Premium").
     (B) The Corporation shall only be required to deliver the Make-Whole Premium with respect to shares of Series I Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion from and after the opening of business on the Trading Day immediately following the Fundamental Change Effective Date of the Fundamental Change until the close of business on the 30th Trading Day following such Fundamental Change Effective Date.
 
     (C) The number of Additional Shares shall be determined by reference to the table below, based on the Fundamental Change Effective Date and the Stock Price.
     (i) The Stock Prices set forth in the table, the Cap Price and the Floor Price shall be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Series I Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to Section 7 by multiplying the applicable price in effect immediately before the adjustment by a fraction: (a) whose numerator is the Conversion Rate immediately before the adjustment; and (b) whose denominator is the adjusted Conversion Rate.
     (ii) In addition, the number of Additional Shares shall be adjusted at the same time, in the same manner in which, and for the same events for which, the Conversion Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 7; provided, that in no event shall Additional Shares be issued pursuant to this Section 12 if, after giving effect thereto, the Conversion Rate would exceed 1.0152 (subject to adjustment as provided below, the "Cap Conversion Rate"). If an event occurs that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as described in Section 7, the Cap Conversion Rate shall be adjusted concurrently and in the same manner in which the Conversion Rate is adjusted as described in Section 7.
     (D) The exact Stock Price and Fundamental Change Effective Date may not be set forth in the table in Section 12(C), in which case:
     (i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices on the table or the Fundamental Change Effective Date is between two Fundamental Change Effective Dates on the table, the Make-Whole Premium shall be determined by straight-line interpolation between the Make-Whole Premium amounts set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the two Fundamental Change Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
     (ii) if the Stock Price is in excess of $200.00 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 12(C), the "Cap Price"), no Make-Whole Premium will be paid; and
     (iii) if the Stock Price is less than $49.25 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 12(C), the "Floor Price"), no Make-Whole Premium will be paid.
 
     (E) No later than the third Business Day after the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Corporation shall provide the Holders and the Transfer Agent with notice of the occurrence of the fundamental change, which such notice shall state:
     (i) the events constituting the Fundamental Change;
     (ii) the date of the Fundamental Change;
     (iii) the last date on which a Holder may convert shares of Series I Preferred Stock in connection with such Fundamental Change;
     (iv) the Conversion Rate and, if applicable, Make-Whole Premium and/or other consideration issuable upon conversions of shares of Series I Preferred Stock in connection with such Fundamental Change as contemplated by Section 11 and this Section 12;
     (v) whether the Corporation will issue Common Stock or cash upon conversion of shares of Series I Preferred Stock in connection with the Fundamental Change and whether any of the consideration issuable upon a conversion of shares of Series I Preferred Stock in connection with such Fundamental Change will consist of Reference Property (and, in such case, specifying such Reference Property);
     (vi) the name and address of the paying agent and the conversion agent; and
     (vii) the procedures that the Holder must follow to exercise the Fundamental Change conversion right.
     (F) Prior to the opening of business on the first Trading Day following any date on which the Corporation provides the notice specified in Section 12(E) to the Holders, the Corporation shall issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones News Service or Bloomberg Business News (or if either such service is not available, another broadly disseminated news or press release service selected by the Corporation) or post notice on its website containing the information specified in Section 12(E).
     Section 13. . The Series I Preferred Stock shall be subject to the restrictions on ownership and transfer set forth in Article VI of the By-laws. Any person that violates such restrictions in acquiring actual or constructive ownership of shares of Series I Preferred Stock is required to give notice thereof immediately to the Corporation and provide the Corporation with such other information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect of such acquisition on the Corporation's status as a REIT. All certificates representing shares of the Series I Preferred Stock shall be marked with a legend sufficient under the laws of the State of Delaware to provide a purchaser of such shares with notice of the restrictions on transfer under Article VI of the By-laws. Nothing in Article VI of the By-laws shall preclude the settlement of any transactions entered into through the facilities of the NYSE or any other national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. The fact that settlement of any transaction takes place shall not, however, negate the effect of any provision of Article VI of the By-laws, and any transferee, and the shares of capital stock transferred to such transferee in such a transaction, shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations in Article VI of the By-laws.
Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer
 
     Section 14. . No fractional shares of Common Stock or securities representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock, whether voluntary or mandatory. Instead, the Corporation may elect to either make a cash payment to each Holder that would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share (based on the Daily VWAP of such fractional share determined as of the second Trading Day immediately prior to the payment thereof) or, in lieu of such cash payment, the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to any particular Holder upon conversion or in respect of dividend payments shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share.
No Fractional Shares
     Section 15. .
Certificates
     (A) (i) Each Series I Preferred Stock certificate shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A, which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Certificate of Designation. The Series I Preferred Stock certificate may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rules, agreements to which the Corporation is subject, if any, or usage; provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Corporation. Each Series I Preferred Stock certificate shall be dated the date of its countersignature and registration.
     (ii) The Series I Preferred Stock shall be issued initially in the form of one or more fully registered global certificates with the global securities legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto (the "Global Series I Preferred Stock"), which shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers represented thereby with the Transfer Agent, as custodian for DTC (or with such other custodian as DTC may direct), and registered in the name of DTC or a nominee of DTC, duly executed by the Corporation and countersigned and registered by the Transfer Agent as hereinafter provided. The number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock represented by the Global Series I Preferred Stock may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Transfer Agent and DTC or its nominee as hereinafter provided.
     (iii) In the event the Global Series I Preferred Stock is deposited with or on behalf of DTC, the Corporation shall execute and the Transfer Agent shall countersign, register and deliver initially one or more Global Series I Preferred Stock certificates that (a) shall be registered in the name of DTC as depository for such Global Series I Preferred Stock or the nominee of DTC and (b) shall be delivered by the Transfer Agent to DTC or pursuant to DTC's instructions or held by the Transfer Agent as custodian for DTC.
     (iv) Members of, or participants in, DTC shall have no rights under this Certificate of Designation with respect to any Global Series I Preferred Stock held on their behalf by DTC or by the Transfer Agent as the custodian of DTC or under such Global Series I Preferred Stock, and DTC may be treated by the Corporation, the Transfer Agent and any agent of the Corporation or the Transfer Agent as the absolute owner of such Global Series I Preferred Stock for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Corporation, the Transfer Agent or any agent of the Corporation or the Transfer Agent from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by DTC or impair, as between DTC and its members or participants, the operation of customary practices of DTC governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Series I Preferred Stock.
 
     (v) Except as provided in Section 15(C), owners of beneficial interests in Global Series I Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Series I Preferred Stock in fully registered certificated form ("Certificated Series I Preferred Stock").
     (B) Two Officers shall sign any certificate representing the Series I Preferred Stock, on behalf of the Corporation, by manual or facsimile signature. If an Officer whose signature is on a Series I Preferred Stock certificate no longer holds that office at the time the Transfer Agent countersigns and registers the Series I Preferred Stock certificate, the Series I Preferred Stock certificate shall be valid nevertheless. A Series I Preferred Stock certificate shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Transfer Agent signs the Series I Preferred Stock certificate by manual signature. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Series I Preferred Stock certificate has been countersigned and registered under this Certificate of Designation. The Transfer Agent shall countersign, register and deliver certificates of Series I Preferred Stock for original issue upon a written order of the Corporation signed by two Officers or by an Officer and an Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation. Such order shall specify the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be countersigned and registered and the date on which the original issue of the Series I Preferred Stock is to be countersigned and registered.
     The Transfer Agent may appoint a countersignature and registration agent reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to countersign and register the certificates for the Series I Preferred Stock. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, a countersignature and registration agent may countersign and register certificates for the Series I Preferred Stock whenever the Transfer Agent may do so. Each reference in this Certificate of Designation to countersignature and registration by the Transfer Agent includes countersignature and registration by such agent. A countersignature and registration agent has the same rights as the Transfer Agent for service of notices and demands.
     (C) (i) When Certificated Series I Preferred Stock is presented to the Transfer Agent with a request to register the transfer of such Certificated Series I Preferred Stock or to exchange such Certificated Series I Preferred Stock for an equal number of shares of Certificated Series I Preferred Stock, the Transfer Agent shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Certificated Series I Preferred Stock surrendered for transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation and the Transfer Agent, duly executed by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing.
     (ii) Certificated Series I Preferred Stock may not be exchanged for a beneficial interest in Global Series I Preferred Stock except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below. Upon receipt by the Transfer Agent of Certificated Series I Preferred Stock, duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation and the Transfer Agent, together with written instructions directing the Transfer Agent to make, or to direct DTC to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Series I Preferred Stock to reflect an increase in the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock represented by the Global Series I Preferred Stock, then the Transfer Agent shall cancel such Certificated Series I Preferred Stock and cause, or direct DTC to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between DTC and the
 
Transfer Agent, the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock represented by the Global Series I Preferred Stock to be increased accordingly. If no Global Series I Preferred Stock is then outstanding, the Corporation shall issue and the Transfer Agent shall countersign and register, upon written order of the Corporation in the form of an Officers' Certificate, a new Global Series I Preferred Stock certificate representing the appropriate number of shares.
     (iii) The transfer and exchange of Global Series I Preferred Stock or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through DTC, in accordance with this Certificate of Designation (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of DTC therefor.
     (iv) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Designation (other than the provisions set forth in Section 15(C)(v)), shares of Global Series I Preferred Stock may not be transferred as a whole except by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or by DTC or any such nominee to a successor depository or a nominee of such successor depository.
     (v) If at any time:
(a) DTC notifies the Corporation that DTC is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for the Global Series I Preferred Stock and a successor depository for the Global Series I Preferred Stock is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days after delivery of such notice;
(b) DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and a successor depository for the Global Series I Preferred Stock is not appointed by the Corporation within 90 days; or
(c) the Corporation, in its sole discretion, notifies the Transfer Agent in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of Certificated Series I Preferred Stock under this Certificate of Designation,
then (and only then) persons having a beneficial interest in the Series I Preferred Stock may exchange such beneficial interest for Certificated Series I Preferred Stock representing the same number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock. In such event, upon receipt by the Transfer Agent of written instructions from the Corporation and written instructions (or such other form of instructions) as is customary for DTC from DTC or its nominee on behalf of any Person having a beneficial interest in Global Series I Preferred Stock, then, the Transfer Agent or DTC, at the direction of the Transfer Agent, shall cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between DTC and the Transfer Agent, the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock represented by Global Series I Preferred Stock to be reduced on its books and records and, following such reduction, the Corporation shall execute and the Transfer Agent shall countersign, register and deliver to the transferee Certificated Series I Preferred Stock.
     Certificated Series I Preferred Stock issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in Global Series I Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 15(C)(v) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as DTC, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Transfer Agent. The Transfer Agent shall deliver
 
such Certificated Series I Preferred Stock to the Persons in whose names such Series I Preferred Stock are so registered in accordance with the instructions of DTC.
     (vi) At such time as all beneficial interests in Global Series I Preferred Stock have either been exchanged for Certificated Series I Preferred Stock, converted or canceled, such Global Series I Preferred Stock shall be returned to DTC for cancelation or retained and canceled by the Transfer Agent. At any time prior to such cancelation, if any beneficial interest in Global Series I Preferred Stock is exchanged for Certificated Series I Preferred Stock, converted or canceled, the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock represented by such Global Series I Preferred Stock shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the Transfer Agent with respect to such Global Series I Preferred Stock, by the Transfer Agent or DTC, to reflect such reduction.
 
     (D) If any of the Series I Preferred Stock certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Corporation shall issue, in exchange and in substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Series I Preferred Stock certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the Series I Preferred Stock certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Series I Preferred Stock certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent amount of shares of Series I Preferred Stock, but only upon receipt of evidence of such loss, theft or destruction of such Series I Preferred Stock certificate and indemnity, if requested, reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation and the Transfer Agent.
     (E) Until definitive Series I Preferred Stock certificates are ready for delivery, the Corporation may prepare and the Transfer Agent shall countersign temporary Series I Preferred Stock certificates. Temporary Series I Preferred Stock certificates shall be substantially in the form of definitive Series I Preferred Stock certificates but may have variations that the Corporation considers appropriate for temporary Series I Preferred Stock certificates. Without unreasonable delay, the Corporation shall prepare and the Transfer Agent shall countersign definitive Series I Preferred Stock certificates and deliver them in exchange for temporary Series I Preferred Stock certificates.
     (F) The Transfer Agent and no one else shall cancel and destroy all Series I Preferred Stock certificates surrendered for transfer, exchange, replacement or cancelation and deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Corporation unless the Corporation directs the Transfer Agent to deliver canceled Series I Preferred Stock certificates to the Corporation.
     Section 16. .
Other Provisions
     (A) Unless otherwise specified in this Certificate of Designation, all notices provided hereunder shall be given by first-class mail to each record Holder of shares of Series I Preferred
 
Stock at such Holder's address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. With respect to any notice to a Holder required to be provided hereunder, neither failure to mail such notice, nor any defect therein or in the mailing thereof, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the proceedings referred to in such notice with respect to the other Holders or affect the legality or validity of any distribution, rights, warrant, reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or the vote upon any such action. Any notice which was mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the Holder receives the notice.
     (B) The shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be issuable only in whole shares.
     (C) All notice periods referred to herein shall commence on the date of the mailing of the applicable notice. Notice to any Holder shall be given to the registered address set forth in the Corporation's records for such Holder, or for the Global Series I Preferred Stock, to the Depository in accordance with its procedures.
     (D) Any payments required to be made hereunder on any day that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without interest or additional payment for such delay.
     (E) Holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any preemptive rights to acquire additional capital stock of the Corporation.
     (F) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the procedures for conversion and voting of shares of Series I Preferred Stock represented by Global Series I Preferred Stock will be governed by arrangements among DTC, its participants and persons that may hold beneficial interests through such participants designed to permit settlement without the physical movement of certificates. Payments, transfers, deliveries, exchanges and other matters relating to beneficial interests in Global Series I Preferred Stock certificates may be subject to various policies and procedures adopted by DTC from time to time.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Certificate of Designation to be signed this 4th of March, 2011.

Exhibit 8.1
Health Care REIT, Inc. 4500 Dorr Street Toledo, Ohio 43615
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special tax counsel to Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale of 28,750,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Stock"), pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated March 1, 2011 to the prospectus dated May 7, 2009 (collectively, the "Prospectus") included in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159040) (the "Registration Statement"), filed on May 7, 2009 with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You have requested our opinion regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement, dated March 1, 2011, between the Company and UBS Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as Representatives of the Several Underwriters (collectively, not including the Company, the "Underwriters") (the "Agreement"), in connection with the fulfillment of one of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Common Stock being sold. Certain capitalized terms used herein without definition are as defined in the Agreement.
     In giving this opinion, we have examined the following:
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. March 7, 2011 Page 2
     In connection with the opinions rendered below, we have assumed with your consent that:
     1. Each of the documents referred to above has been duly authorized, executed and delivered; is authentic, if an original, or is accurate, if a copy; and has not been amended;
     2. During its taxable years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2010, the Company has operated, and, in future taxable years, the Company will operate, in a manner that has caused or will make, as the case may be, the factual representations relating to the ownership, operation, future method of operations, and compliance of the Company with the real estate investment trust ("REIT") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury Regulations (the "Regulations") thereunder, as in effect as of the date hereof, contained in a certificate, dated on or about the date hereof, and executed by a duly appointed officer of the Company (the "Officer's Certificate"), true for such years;
     3. The Company will not make any amendments to its organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would affect its qualification as a REIT under sections 856-860 of the Code for any taxable year; and
     4. No action will be taken by the Company after the date hereof that would have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinions set forth below are based.
     In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinions rendered below. For the purposes of rendering these opinions, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in any documents delivered to us, including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate. We have relied completely upon the Company's representations that the information presented in such documents accurately reflects all material facts. In the course of our representation of the
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. March 7, 2011 Page 3
Company, we have not been made aware of any facts inconsistent with such factual representations. In addition, where such factual representations involve terms defined or used in the Code, the Regulations, published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service or other relevant authority, we have explained such terms to the Company's representatives and are satisfied that the Company's representatives understand such terms and are capable of making such factual representations.
     Based on the Code, Regulations, documents, assumptions and statements set forth above, the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate and our review of the discussion in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 under the caption "Taxation," and any amendments thereto (and any similar sections or information contained in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus), we are of the opinion that:
     (a) the Company is qualified to be taxed as a REIT pursuant to sections 856 through 860 of the Code for its taxable years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2010, and the Company's organization and current and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for all future taxable years; and
     (b) the statements contained under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and any amendments thereto (and any similar sections or information contained in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus), are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax (i) treatment of the Company and (ii) considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Common Stock.
     We will not review on a continuing basis the Company's compliance with the documents or assumptions set forth above, or the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. March 7, 2011 Page 4

Exhibit 8.2
Health Care REIT, Inc. 4500 Dorr Street Toledo, Ohio 43615
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special tax counsel to Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale of 14,375,000 shares of 6.50% Series I Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated March 1, 2011 to the prospectus dated May 7, 2009 (collectively, the "Prospectus") included in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159040) (the "Registration Statement"), filed on May 7, 2009 with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You have requested our opinion regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement, dated March 1, 2011, between the Company and UBS Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as Representatives of the Several Underwriters (collectively, not including the Company, the "Underwriters") (the "Agreement"), in connection with the fulfillment of one of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Preferred Stock being sold. Certain capitalized terms used herein without definition are as defined in the Agreement.
     In giving this opinion, we have examined the following:
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. March 7, 2011 Page 2
     In connection with the opinions rendered below, we have assumed with your consent that:
     1. Each of the documents referred to above has been duly authorized, executed and delivered; is authentic, if an original, or is accurate, if a copy; and has not been amended;
     2. During its taxable years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2010, the Company has operated, and, in future taxable years, the Company will operate, in a manner that has caused or will make, as the case may be, the factual representations relating to the ownership, operation, future method of operations, and compliance of the Company with the real estate investment trust ("REIT") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury Regulations (the "Regulations") thereunder, as in effect as of the date hereof, contained in a certificate, dated on or about the date hereof, and executed by a duly appointed officer of the Company (the "Officer's Certificate"), true for such years;
     3. The Company will not make any amendments to its organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would affect its qualification as a REIT under sections 856-860 of the Code for any taxable year; and
     4. No action will be taken by the Company after the date hereof that would have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinions set forth below are based.
     In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinions rendered below. For the purposes of rendering these opinions, we have not made an independent investigation of the facts set forth in any documents delivered to us, including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate. We have relied completely upon the Company's representations that the information presented in such documents accurately reflects all material facts. In the course of our representation of the
 
Health Care REIT, Inc. March 7, 2011 Page 3
Company, we have not been made aware of any facts inconsistent with such factual representations. In addition, where such factual representations involve terms defined or used in the Code, the Regulations, published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service or other relevant authority, we have explained such terms to the Company's representatives and are satisfied that the Company's representatives understand such terms and are capable of making such factual representations.
     Based on the Code, Regulations, documents, assumptions and statements set forth above, the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate and our review of the discussion in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 under the caption "Taxation," and any amendments thereto, and the discussion under the caption "Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations" in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we are of the opinion that:
     (a) the Company is qualified to be taxed as a REIT pursuant to sections 856 through 860 of the Code for its taxable years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2010, and the Company's organization and current and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for all future taxable years; and
     (b) the statements contained under the heading "Taxation" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and any amendments thereto, and the statements contained under the heading "Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations" in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, are correct and accurate in all material respects and present fairly and accurately the material aspects of the federal income tax (i) treatment of the Company and (ii) considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Preferred Stock.
     We will not review on a continuing basis the Company's compliance with the documents or assumptions set forth above, or the factual representations set forth in the Officer's Certificate. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
