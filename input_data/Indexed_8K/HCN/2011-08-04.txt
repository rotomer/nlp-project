billion. The company continues to expect dispositions of $300 million for the full year, of which $282 million has been completed through June 30, 2011.
The company is narrowing its 2011 earnings guidance solely to reflect year-to-date timing of dispositions.

Normalized FAD has been revised to a range of $3.02 to $3.08 per diluted share from the previous $3.01 to $3.11 per diluted share, representing an increase of 6-8% from 2010. Net income attributable to common stockholders has been increased to a range of $1.04 to $1.10 per diluted share from $0.97 to $1.07 per diluted share. The company's guidance does not include any investments beyond what has been closed or identified year-to-date nor any additional transaction costs, capital transactions, impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other one-time items, including any additional cash payments other than normal monthly rental payments. Please see the exhibits for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO and FAD.

Conference Call Information
Key Performance Indicators
 
Quarterly Earnings
 
(a) Amounts may not sum due to rounding
 
The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry
Supplemental Reporting Measures
 
 
 
 
investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1. FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings. Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1. The company believes that normalized FFO and normalized FAD are useful supplemental measures of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use these measures to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.
The company's supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of the supplemental reporting measures.

GLOSSARY
34
Age: Current year, less the year built, adjusted for major renovations.
Assisted Living: Assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living, including management of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating.
Cap-ex, Tenant Improvements, Leasing Commissions: Represents amounts paid in cash for: 1) recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, 2) second generation tenant improvements and 3) leasing commissions paid to third party leasing agents to secure new tenants.
Cash Flow Coverage: Represents the ratio of EBITDARM to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans. CFC is a measure of a property's ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations, assuming that management fees are not paid. The coverage shown excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed or for which data is not available or meaningful.
CCRC: Continuing care retirement communities are campuses with both independent living and skilled nursing, but often include detached homes and/or assisted living as well. Resident payment plans vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental fees. Many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services.
Combination: A property that offers two or more levels of care (i.e. independent living, assisted living, dementia and skilled nursing), but does not meet the definition of a CCRC.
Committed Balance: Represents investment balance plus unfunded construction commitments for which initial funding has commenced.
Construction Conversion: Represents completed construction projects that were placed into service and began earning rent.
Dementia Care: Certain assisted living facilities may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and/or similar forms of dementia.
EBITDARM: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate EBITDARM and has not independently verified the information. EBITDARM is used to calculate CFC.
Entrance Fee: A property where the resident pays a substantial upfront fee and an ongoing monthly service fee for the right to occupy a unit. Typically, a portion of the upfront fee is refundable.
Expense per Occupied Unit: Represents the ratio of revenue less EBITDARM to occupied units based on the most recent quarter of available data and excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed, or for which data is not available or meaningful. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate expense per occupied unit and has not independently verified the information.
Freestanding: A property that offers one level of service.
Health System-Affiliated: Properties are considered affiliated with a health system if one or more of the following conditions are met: 1) the land parcel is contained within the physical boundaries of a hospital campus; 2) the land parcel is located adjacent to the campus; 3) the building is physically connected to the hospital regardless of the land ownership structure; 4) a ground lease is maintained with a health system entity; 5) a master lease is maintained with a health system entity; 6) significant square footage is leased to a health system entity; 7) the property includes an ambulatory surgery center with a hospital partnership interest; or (8) a significant square footage is leased to a physician group that is either employed, directly or indirectly by a health system, or has a significant clinical and financial affiliation with the health system.
 
Hospitals: Hospitals generally include acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and long-term acute care hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including, but not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories. Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions who require more intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities.
Independent Living: Independent living facilities are age-restricted multi-family properties with central dining facilities that provide residents access to28 meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities.
Initial Cash Yield: Represents annualized contractual or projected income to be received in cash at date of investment divided by investment amount.
Investment Amount:
Acquisitions  Represents purchase price excluding accounting adjustments pursuant to U.S. GAAP. New loans  Represents face amount of new loan.
Construction conversion  Represents book balance converted from CIP to real property upon completion. Capital improvements to existing properties  Represents cash funded to tenants under an existing lease. Loan advances  Represents cash funded to operators under an existing loan agreement.
Investment Balance: Represents net book value of real estate investments or the company's interest in unconsolidated joint ventures as reflected on the company's balance sheet.
Life Science: Life science buildings are laboratory and office facilities, often located near universities, specifically constructed and designed for use by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
Medical Office: Medical office buildings are office and clinic facilities, often located near hospitals or on hospital campuses, specifically constructed and designed for use by physicians and other health care personnel to provide services to their patients. They may also include ambulatory surgery centers that are used for general or specialty surgical procedures not requiring an overnight stay in a hospital. Medical office buildings typically contain sole and group physician practices and may provide laboratory and other patient services.
Metropolitan Statistical Area: Metropolitan statistical areas are geographic entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use by Federal statistical agencies in collecting, tabulating and publishing Federal statistics. The NIC MAP Data and Analysis Service provides revenue, supply and demographic information for the IL/CCRC, assisted living, and skilled nursing service types and commonly aggregates the information for the top 31, top 75 and top 100 MSAs. The company provides investment balance information in the same categories as another measure of geographic concentration.
Occupancy: Medical office occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased and occupied, including month-to-month leases, as of the date reported. Occupancy for all other property types represents average quarterly operating occupancy based on the most recent quarter of available data and excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed or for which data is not available or meaningful. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate occupancy and has not independently verified the information.
Region Definitions: Eight divisions as established by the Census Bureau.
New England  Connecticut , Maine , Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont. Middle Atlantic  New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania.
East North Central  Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin.

Renewal Rate: The ratio of total square feet expiring and available for lease to total renewed square feet.
Renewed Square Feet: Square feet expiring during the reporting period upon which a lease is executed by the current occupant.
Rental: A property where the resident pays a monthly market rate for the level of care provided, but is not required to pay a substantial upfront fee.
Revenue per Occupied Unit: Represents the ratio of total revenue to occupied units based on the most recent quarter of available data and excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed, or for which data is not available or meaningful. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate revenue per occupied unit and has not independently verified the information.
Same Store: For the medical office building portfolio, same store is defined as those properties owned for the entire previous five quarters. Properties acquired, developed or classified in discontinued operations are excluded from the same store amounts. For all other property types, same store is defined as those properties in the stable portfolio for the 24 months preceding the end of the portfolio performance reporting period, unless otherwise noted. Excludes senior housing operating portfolio.
Senior Housing Operating: Includes independent and assisted living properties held in consolidated joint ventures, structured to take advantage of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007.
Senior Housing Triple-net: Includes independent and assisted living properties subject to triple-net operating leases and real estate loans receivable.
Skilled Nursing: Skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement and are subject to triple-net operating leases.
Square Feet: Net rentable square feet calculated utilizing Building Owners and Managers Association measurement standards.
Stable: Generally, a property is considered stable (versus unstabilized or under development) when it has achieved lease up or, if targeted performance has not been achieved, 12 months following the budgeted stabilization date. Entrance fee communities are considered stable after achieving aggregate property occupancy of 80% or more.
Unstabilized: An acquisition that does not meet the stable criteria upon closing or a construction property that has opened but not yet reached stabilization.
Yield on Sale: Represents annualized contractual income that was being received in cash at date of disposition divided by disposition cash proceeds.
 
The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed on page 13. FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings. Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for certain items detailed on page 13. The company believes that normalized FFO and normalized FAD are useful supplemental measures of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use these measures to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. A covenant in our line of credit arrangement contains a financial ratio based on a definition of EBITDA that is specific to that agreement. Failure to satisfy this covenant could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Due to the materiality of this debt agreement and the financial covenant, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above and adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses and gain/loss on extinguishment of debt. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. Fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. Effecitve July 27, 2011, our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge ratio of at least 1.50 times.
Net operating income (NOI) is used to evaluate the operating performance of the company's properties. The company defines NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements and discontinued operations, less property operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments and interest expense. The company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the company's properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. The company uses NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
Other than Adjusted EBITDA, the company's supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. Adjusted EBITDA is used solely to determine our compliance with a financial covenant of our line of credit arrangement and is not being presented for use by investors for any other purpose. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from
operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Multi-period amounts may not equal the sum of the individual quarterly amounts due to rounding.
