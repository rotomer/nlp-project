Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN
"Health Care REIT's relationship investing strategy continues to generate significant opportunities, as demonstrated by nearly $650 million of investments completed during the third quarter of 2011. These high-quality investments are concentrated in private-pay seniors housing assets, such as our new investment with Chelsea Senior Living, as well as health system affiliated medical office buildings," said George L. Chapman, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Health Care REIT. "We continue to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio while generating strong financial results, as evidenced by our 13% FFO per share growth and 7% FAD per share growth during the third quarter. As previously announced, we have increased our 2012 dividend rate 4% above our 2011 payments, a result of the strength of our existing portfolio, future pipeline and earnings growth potential."

nd
consecutive quarterly dividend payment.
As previously announced, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend rate of $0.74 per share ($2.96 per share annually), commencing with the February 2012 dividend payment. The company's dividend policy was reviewed during the Board of Director's October meeting. The declaration and payment of quarterly dividends remains subject to review by and approval of the Board of Directors.
Dividends for 2012
The company completed $644 million of gross investments, including $569 million of acquisitions in the third quarter at a blended yield of 7.3%. Significant investments include $308 million for ten seniors housing communities operated by Chelsea Senior Living and $146 million for 630,000 rentable square feet of medical office buildings. The medical office buildings are primarily affiliated with health systems and are over 95% occupied. The remaining investments were in high quality seniors housing and health care facilities. All of the new acquisitions are structured as triple-net leases.
Third Quarter Investment Highlights
The company closed a $308 million acquisition and leaseback of ten combination seniors housing communities with Chelsea Senior Living, a high-quality seniors housing operator based in New Jersey. Eight of the ten communities are located in New Jersey and two are located on Long Island, New York, all within the metropolitan New York

MSA. With the close of the investment in September 2011, Chelsea becomes the 8th-largest operator in the company's portfolio. The investment is structured as a triple-net lease with a 2012 lease rate of 6.8%. In addition to annual increasers, the lease provides for a mark-to-market of the rent at years four and nine subject to a floor of the prior year's rental yield plus 25 basis points.
The company has completed acquisitions and joint venture investments year-to-date of $4.6 billion, up from the previously announced $4.0 billion, and funded development of $260 million, resulting in gross investments of $4.8 billion. The company has completed $298 million of dispositions through September 30, 2011 and now expects dispositions of $350 million for the full year, up from the previously announced $300 million.
Investment Activity
The company is increasing its normalized FFO per share guidance from $3.34 to $3.40 per diluted share to a range of $3.38 to $3.43 per diluted share, which represents an increase of 10-11% from 2010. The increase relative to prior guidance reflects the closing of $644 million of gross investments in the third quarter, offset partially by higher dispositions. Normalized FAD guidance has been narrowed to a range of $3.03 to $3.08 per diluted share from the previous $3.02 to $3.08 per diluted share, representing an increase of 7-8% from 2010. Net income attributable to common stockholders has been lowered to a range of $0.99 to $1.04 per diluted share from $1.04 to $1.10 per diluted share. The company's guidance does not include any investments beyond what has been closed year-to-date nor any additional transaction costs, capital transactions, impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other one-time items, including any additional cash payments other than normal monthly rental payments. Please see the exhibits for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO and FAD.

Conference Call Information
Key Performance Indicators
Quarterly Earnings
 
The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement.
Supplemental Reporting Measures
 
Page 2 of 7
However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1. FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings. Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1. The company believes that normalized FFO and normalized FAD are useful supplemental measures of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use these measures to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items. The company's supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures.

GLOSSARY
GLOSSARY
Cap-ex, Tenant Improvements, Leasing Commissions: Represents amounts paid in cash for: 1) recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, 2) second generation tenant improvements and 3) leasing commissions paid to third party leasing agents to secure new tenants.
Cash Flow Coverage: Represents the ratio of EBITDARM to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans. CFC is a measure of a property's ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations, assuming that management fees are not paid. The coverage shown excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed or for which data is not available or meaningful.
Cash Yield: Represents annualized contractual or projected income to be received in cash divided by investment amount.
CCRC: Continuing care retirement communities include a combination of detached homes, an independent living facility, an assisted living facility and/or a skilled nursing facility on one campus. Resident payment plans vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental fees. Many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services.
Committed Balance: Represents investment balance plus unfunded construction commitments for which initial funding has commenced.
Construction Conversion: Represents completed construction projects that were placed into service and began earning rent.
EBITDARM: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate EBITDARM and has not independently verified the information. EBITDARM is used to calculate CBMF.
Entrance Fee: A property where the resident pays a substantial upfront fee and an ongoing monthly service fee for the right to occupy a unit. Typically, a portion of the upfront fee is refundable.
Expense per Occupied Unit: Represents the ratio of revenue less EBITDARM to occupied units based on the most recent quarter of available data and excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed, or for which data is not available or meaningful. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate expense per occupied unit and has not independently verified the information.
34
Health System-Affiliated: Properties are considered affiliated with a health system if one or more of the following conditions are met: 1) the land parcel is contained within the physical boundaries of a hospital campus; 2) the land parcel is located adjacent to the campus; 3) the building is physically connected to the hospital regardless of the land ownership structure; 4) a ground lease is maintained with a health system entity; 5) a master lease is maintained with a health system entity; 6) significant square footage is leased to a health system entity; 7) the property includes an ambulatory surgery center with a hospital partnership interest; or (8) a significant square footage is leased to a physician group that is either employed, directly or indirectly by a health system, or has a significant clinical and financial affiliation with the health system.
28
Hospitals: Hospitals generally include acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and long-term acute care hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including, but not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories. Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions who require more intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities.
Investment Amount:
Acquisitions  Represents purchase price excluding accounting adjustments pursuant to U.S. GAAP.
New loans  Represents face amount of new loan.
Construction conversion  Represents book balance converted from CIP to real property upon completion.
Capital improvements to existing properties  Represents cash funded to tenants under an existing lease.
Loan advances  Represents cash funded to operators under an existing loan agreement.
Investment Balance: Represents net book value of real estate investments or the company's interest in unconsolidated joint ventures as reflected on the company's balance sheet.

They may also include ambulatory surgery centers that are used for general or specialty surgical procedures not requiring an overnight stay in a hospital. Medical office buildings typically contain sole and group physician practices and may provide laboratory and other patient services.
GLOSSARY
Occupancy: Medical office occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased and occupied, including month-to-month leases, as of the date reported. Occupancy for all other property types represents average quarterly operating occupancy based on the most recent quarter of available data and excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed or for which data is not available or meaningful. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate occupancy and has not independently verified the information.

SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING MEASURES
23 The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers EBITDA and net operating income (NOI) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance.
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. A covenant in our line of credit arrangement contains a financial ratio based on a definition of EBITDA that is specific to that agreement. Failure to satisfy this covenant could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Due to the materiality of this debt agreement and the financial covenant, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above and adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses and gain/loss on extinguishment of debt. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. Fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. Our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge ratio of at least 1.50 times.
Net operating income (NOI) is used to evaluate the operating performance of the company's properties. The company defines NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements and discontinued operations, less property operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments and interest expense. The company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the company's properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. The company uses NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
Other than Adjusted EBITDA, the company's supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. The company's management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. Adjusted EBITDA is used solely to determine our compliance with a financial covenant of our line of credit arrangement and is not being presented for use by investors for any other purpose. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Multi-period amounts may not equal the sum of the individual quarterly amounts due to rounding.
