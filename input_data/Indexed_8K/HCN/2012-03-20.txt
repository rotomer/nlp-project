Other Events.
Effective October 23, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") adopted rules related to insider trading. One of these rules, Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provides an exemption to the insider trading rules in the form of an affirmative defense. Rule 10b5-1 recognizes the creation of formal programs under which executives and other insiders may sell the securities of publicly traded companies on a regular basis pursuant to written plans that are entered into at a time when the plan participants are not aware of material non-public information and that otherwise comply with the requirements of
Rule 10b5-1.
On January 28, 2003, the Board of Directors of Health Care REIT, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a resolution modifying its insider trading policy to allow insiders to sell securities of the Company pursuant to pre-arranged trading plans.
On March 15, 2012, George L. Chapman, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, entered into a plan pursuant to which he instructed his broker to sell up to 24,476 shares of the Company's common stock, exercise options and sell up to 57,648 shares of the Company's common stock and exercise options and hold 4,509 shares of the Company's common stock during the period between April 16, 2012 and February 15, 2013. The number of shares to be sold under Mr. Chapman's plan ranges from 15,664 to 26,353 shares per month, not including any unsold shares that might be carried over from previous months.
Reports of the details of actual sales under the plan will be filed by Mr. Chapman on Form 4 in accordance with SEC regulations.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
