Toledo, Ohio, May 8, 2012..
Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN
) today announced operating results for the companys
first quarter ended March 31, 2012.
 
 Our relationship investment strategy is working, commented George L. Chapman, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Health Care REIT.  We have completed $1.3 billion of investments year-to-date, including $753 million in the first quarter.  Nearly 90% of our first quarter investments were derived from existing relationships, with the remainder primarily representing a new investment with Senior Lifestyle Corporation, the 10 largest seniors housing operator in the country.  Our steady stream of investments over the past year generated excellent 24% FFO per share and 26% FAD per share growth.  Finally, our capital transactions lowered our blended cost of capital, reduced overall leverage, and provided significant liquidity to support our investment program throughout the remainder of 2012 as we continue to deliver strong total returns for our shareholders.

First Quarter Investment Highlights
   
 
During the quarter the company completed $426 million in medical office building investments at a blended yield of 6.7%.  The investments include the previously announced acquisition of 11 medical office buildings for $298 million, one additional acquisition, and one development conversion.  Each building is affiliated with a health system.  The average occupancy is 94%.  The 12 buildings acquired total one million rentable square feet, for an average size of 83,000 rentable square feet.  The development conversion represents our second project with Virtua Health and is comprised of a 292,000 rentable square foot building on the campus of Virtua Healths flagship hospital in Voorhees, New Jersey.  Virtua Health is a large, non-profit health system based in New Jersey.  The project is currently 98% leased. 
 
During the quarter the company completed $119 million in seniors housing triple-net lease investments at a blended yield of 7.6%.  The investments include the acquisition of three facilities operated by Senior Lifestyle and one development conversion.  Senior Lifestyle, headquartered in Chicago, is the 10 largest seniors housing provider in the U.S., operating almost 10,000 units across 21 states.   Senior Lifestyle is a new relationship to the company that is expected to grow in the future.  The three facilities are primarily private pay, include 562 units and offer a continuum of care in a rental model. 
th
 
As previously announced, during the quarter the company completed the acquisition of six communities, in partnership with Belmont Village, for $210 million at a blended yield of 6.8%.  The acquisition represents the second transaction with Belmont Village.  The communities are 100% private pay and include 756 units located in California (1 community in San Diego), Georgia (2 communities in Atlanta), Tennessee (1 community in Memphis; 1 community in Nashville) and Texas (1 facility in Houston).  Consistent with our investment strategy, the communities are located in attractive metropolitan markets, which we expect to support annual NOI growth of 4% to 5%.  The communities will be owned by the companys existing RIDEA partnership with Belmont Village and will continue to be managed by Belmont Village. 
 
Outlook for 2012
  The company is updating its 2012 guidance to reflect investment and financing activity announced year-to-date and certain normalizing items (see Exhibit 1), and to increase its disposition guidance from $200 million to $300 million which consists primarily of non-strategic, Medicaid-oriented skilled nursing facilities. Primarily due to increased disposition guidance, normalized FFO has been revised to a range of $3.50 to $3.60 per diluted share from $3.53 to $3.63 per diluted share and normalized FAD has been revised to a range of $3.08 to $3.18 per diluted share from $3.11 to $3.21 per diluted share. Net income attributable to common stockholders has been revised to a range of $1.09 to $1.19 per diluted share from $1.26 to $1.36 per diluted share.
 
The companys guidance does not include any additional 2012 investments beyond what has been announced, nor any additional transaction costs, capital transactions, impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional one-time items, including any additional cash payments other than normal monthly rental payments.  Please see the exhibits for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO and FAD.

1Q12 Earnings Release

Supplemental Reporting Measures
  The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities.   Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1.  FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings.  Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1.  The company believes that normalized FFO and normalized FAD are useful supplemental measures of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use these measures to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.  The companys supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies.  The companys management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions.  Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management.  The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity.  Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.  Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures and the supplemental information package for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, which is available on the companys website (www.hcreit.com), for information and reconciliations of additional supplemental reporting measures.
