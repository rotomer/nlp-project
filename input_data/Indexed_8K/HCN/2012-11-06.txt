Toledo, Ohio, November 6, 2012..
Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN
) today announced operating results for the companys
third quarter ended September 30, 2012.
 
Our business model continued to hit on all cylinders during the third quarter, commented George L. Chapman, Chairman and CEO of Health Care REIT, Inc.  Our relationship program has produced $1.0 billion of investments in the quarter and $2.9 billion year-to-date.  Our high-quality, diverse portfolio generated another quarter of strong 3.6% same-store NOI growth.  We sit in an excellent liquidity position having successfully raised $2.4 billion of equity during the quarter and our operations team continues to effectively manage our growth.  The completion of the Sunrise Senior Living acquisition coupled with disposition of noncore properties will further strengthen and diversify the quality of our portfolio.  We believe the attributes of our business model position us to continue to deliver consistent and resilient cash flow growth, predictable deal flow, and attractive risk adjusted returns to our shareholders.

Third Quarter Investment Highlights
 
As previously announced, during the quarter the company completed the acquisition of five Sunrise Senior Living properties located in the United Kingdom for $243.5 million at a blended NOI yield of 7.2%.  The five properties were purchased from a partnership between Sunrise and an institutional investor and are included in the previously announced 125 property Sunrise acquisition.  The communities are 100% private pay, include 437 units and are located in attractive metropolitan markets.  Consistent with our seniors housing operating portfolio, we expect annual NOI growth of approximately 4% to 5%.  Sunrise will continue to manage the communities under an incentive-based management contract.
 
During the quarter the company completed $611 million in seniors housing triple-net lease investments at a blended yield of 7.1%.  The investments include acquisitions totaling $586 million at a blended yield of 7.0%, consisting of 19 facilities operated by Senior Lifestyle for $459 million and five facilities with other operators for $127 million.  In addition, two development projects totaling $25 million at a blended yield of 8.5% were completed during the quarter.
 
During the quarter the company completed $56 million in medical office building investments at a blended yield of 7.1%.  The investments include the acquisition of three medical office buildings for $50 million and one development completion.  The three buildings acquired total 220,000 rentable square feet, with a yield of 7.0%.  Each building is affiliated with a health system and average occupancy is 98%.  The development completion represents a 13,400 rentable square foot building that is affiliated with a health system and 100% leased with a yield of 8.5%.
 
Sunrise Acquisition Update
  The 125 property acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE:SRZ) remains on track to close in early 2013.  The company successfully reached agreement to sell the Sunrise management company as announced on September 14, 2012 and continues to work with Sunrise to accelerate the buyout of its partners in certain of the 105 joint venture properties.  The company acquired five of the 105 joint venture properties located in the United Kingdom in the third quarter for approximately $243.5 million.  During the fourth quarter 2012, the company funded its previously announced $467 million loan to Sunrise.  The final amount drawn was $462.5 million.  The proceeds of the loan were used by Sunrise to acquire its partners interests in 33 of the 105 joint venture properties.  As a result of the accelerated joint venture buyouts, the company expects the Sunrise acquisition to include 58 wholly owned properties and 67 joint venture properties at closing.  The accelerated joint venture partner buyouts increases the expected real estate value of the 125 properties from approximately $1.9 billion to approximately $3.2 billion.  Of the 67 joint venture properties, 50 properties remain subject to purchase options that the company may exercise to acquire the partners interests.
 
$925 Million Acquisition Pipeline Update
  On August 6, 2012, Health Care REIT announced anticipated third quarter 2012 acquisitions of $925 million.  During the third quarter, $634 million of those acquisitions have closed and $291 million are now expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2012.  The aggregate acquisition amount includes approximately $134 million of debt that the company expects to assume at an average interest rate of 5.6%.  Approximately $27 million of the aggregate debt is associated with the third quarter acquisitions and $107 million is associated with the fourth quarter acquisitions.

3Q12 Earnings Release

All amounts included in this announcement relating to acquisitions or investments that have not yet closed are preliminary estimates, are subject to downward or upward adjustment, and are subject to change. Furthermore, certain of the estimated investment amounts with respect to the incremental Sunrise investments, including the acquisition of five properties in the United Kingdom, are based on exchange rates in effect as of the time of the estimate. Our anticipated acquisitions and investments are in various stages of closing and some or all of the transactions may not be completed on currently anticipated terms, or within currently anticipated timeframes, or at all. The completion of the anticipated acquisitions and investments is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions.
 
Outlook for 2012
  The company is updating its normalized 2012 FFO and FAD guidance to reflect recently announced investment and capital activity.  Relative to prior FFO and FAD guidance, the midpoint of our guidance ranges would be increasing by $0.04 per share but for the decision to pre-emptively raise capital to fund the Sunrise acquisition, which negatively impacts expectations by $0.11 per share.  As a result, normalized FFO has been updated to a range of $3.49 to $3.53 per diluted share from $3.53 to $3.63 per diluted share and normalized FAD has been updated to a range of $3.07 to $3.11 per diluted share from $3.11 to $3.21 per diluted share. Net income attributable to common stockholders has been revised to a range of $0.91 to $0.95 per diluted share from $1.07 to $1.17 per diluted share.  The company now expects up to $700 million of dispositions in 2012, up from the previous expectation of $300 million, which consist primarily of non-strategic skilled nursing facilities. 
 
The companys guidance does not include any additional 2012 investments beyond what has been announced, nor any additional transaction costs, capital transactions, impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional one-time items, including any additional cash payments other than normal monthly rental payments.  Please see the exhibits for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO and FAD.

3Q12 Earnings Release

Supplemental Reporting Measures
  The company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, the company considers funds from operations (FFO) and funds available for distribution (FAD) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities.   Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1.  FAD represents FFO excluding net straight-line rental adjustments, amortization related to above/below market leases and amortization of non-cash interest expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions at medical office buildings.  Normalized FAD represents FAD excluding prepaid/straight-line rent cash receipts and adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1.  The company believes that normalized FFO and normalized FAD are useful supplemental measures of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use these measures to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.  The companys supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies.  The companys management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions.  Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management.  The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity.  Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by the company, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.  Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures and the supplemental information package for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, which is available on the companys website (www.hcreit.com), for information and reconciliations of additional supplemental reporting measures.
