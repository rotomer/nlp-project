(i)    against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii)    against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or
 
threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii)    against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 6(c) hereof, the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representative), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
 
, , that (A) this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), and (B) with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, this indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriters (or to the benefit of any person controlling an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act) to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of the Underwriters or any person controlling the Underwriters' results from the fact that the Underwriters sold Securities to a person to whom it shall be established there was not sent or given by the Underwriters or on the Underwriters' behalf at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person, a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented), if required by law to have been so delivered, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense and provided that the Company shall have met its obligation pursuant to this Agreement to provide the Underwriters with such Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented).
provided
however
 
(b)    . Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus, preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

(c)    . Each indemnified party shall give written notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action
Actions Against Parties; Notification
 
 
commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; , , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided
however
 
(d)    . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
(e)    .

EDGAR
 
Section 7.    . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation
Contribution
 
 
provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus (or, if Rule 434 is used, the corresponding location on the Term Sheet) bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover (or corresponding location on the Term Sheet, as the case may be).
 
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it were offered exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the
 
 
Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Section 8.    . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
 
Section 9.    .
Termination of Agreement
 
(a)    The Representative may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the date of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States, any outbreak of hostilities or other calamity or crisis or change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to market the Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in the securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission, or if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the NASDAQ National Market has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said Exchanges or by order of the Commission, the NASD or any other governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either federal, New York, Maryland or California authorities. As used in this Section 9(a), the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities.
 
(b)    If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof. Notwithstanding any such termination, the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 7 and 8 shall remain in effect.
 
Section 10.    . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
 
 
(a)    if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
 
(b)    if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.
 
Section 11.    . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of written telecommunication.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION:
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
The Bank of New York, as Trustee
 
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Notes"), issued as a series of securities under an indenture dated as of September 1, 1993 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to the Notes), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is the duly authorized series designated as the "6.00% Senior Notes Due March 1, 2015," originally limited (subject to exceptions provided in the Indenture) in aggregate principal amount to $200,000,000; however, from time to time, without giving notice or seeking consent of the holders of the Notes, the Company may issue additional Notes of this series having the same ranking, interest rate and maturity and other terms as the Notes. All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Notes are not subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company and the Notes are not subject to any sinking fund.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of
 
any payment of principal hereof or any interest on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture. Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes to waive, in certain circumstances, on behalf of all Holders of the Notes, certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on, this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for the purpose in any place where the principal of and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
This Note may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to a nominee of DTC, or by a nominee of DTC to DTC, or to a successor to DTC for such Global Security selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor to DTC. If at any time DTC notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Notes or if at any time DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, if so required by applicable law or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor depositary with respect to the Notes. If (a) a successor depositary for the Notes is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such unwillingness, inability or ineligibility, (b) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of the Notes advise DTC to cease acting as depositary for such Notes, or (c) the Company, in its sole discretion, determines at any time that all Notes (but not less than all) of this series shall no longer be represented by such Global Note or Notes, then the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, definitive Notes of like series, rank, tenor and terms in
 
definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Note or Notes.
 
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons and may be sold in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series in authorized denominations as requested by the Holders surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of the Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Indenture contains provisions whereby (i) the Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to the Notes (subject to the survival of certain provisions thereof), (ii) the Company may be discharged from its obligations with respect to the Notes (subject to certain exceptions), or (iii) the Company may be released from its obligations under specified covenants and agreements in the Indenture, in each case if the Company satisfies certain conditions provided in the Indenture.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any past, present or future stockholder, employee, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
 
THE INDENTURE AND THE NOTE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND FOR ALL PURPOSES SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF SAID STATE.
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes as a convenience to the Holders of the Notes. No representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of such CUSIP numbers as printed on the Notes, and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.
 
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

In connection with the registration of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Securities") by Health Care Property Investors, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), pursuant to (i) a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 19, 2002 (File No. 333-86654), as amended to date, which was declared effective by the Commission on June 10, 2002 (collectively, the "Registration Statement"); (ii) a prospectus dated June 10, 2002 (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated February 25, 2003, filed with the Commission on February 26, 2003 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (the "Prospectus Supplement", and together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"), you have requested our opinion with respect to the matters set forth below.
 
In our capacity as your special counsel in connection with such registration, we are familiar with the proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance of the Securities. In addition, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries, including an examination of originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such documents, corporate records and instruments, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion.
 
In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.
 
We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the internal laws of the State of California, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction, or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any

We understand that certain matters concerning the laws of the State of Maryland are addressed in an opinion of Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll, LLP separately provided to you, and we express no opinion with respect to those matters. In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have, with your permission, assumed that the Company is duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland; that each of the underwriting agreement dated as of February 25, 2003 with Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, as the representative of the other underwriters named on Schedule A therein and the Company (the "Underwriting Agreement"), the indenture dated as of September 1, 1993 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York as trustee and the Securities has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; and that none of the issuance and sale of the Securities by the Company, or the performance and compliance by the Company with the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Securities, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, will result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Company.
 
Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that as of the date hereof, the Securities, when duly executed, issued and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered on behalf of the Company against payment therefor, will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
 
The opinion set forth above relating to the enforceability of the Securities is subject to the following exceptions, limitations and qualifications: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought; and (iii) certain rights, remedies and waivers contained in the Indenture may be limited or rendered ineffective by applicable California laws or judicial decisions governing such provisions, but such laws or judicial decisions will not render the Securities invalid or unenforceable as a whole.
 
We have not been requested to express and, with your knowledge and consent, do not render any opinion as to the applicability to the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Securities of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or applicable state law relating to fraudulent transfers and obligations.
