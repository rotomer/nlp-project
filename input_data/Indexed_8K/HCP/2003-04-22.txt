Statements in this news release and the supplement that are not historical may contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, such as competition for the acquisition and financing of health care facilities, competition for lessees and mortgagors (including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or roll-over of existing leases), continuing operational difficulties in the long-term care and assisted living sectors, the ability to acquire, sell or lease facilities and the timing of acquisitions, sales and leasings, changes in health care laws and regulations and other changes in the health care industry which affect the operations of our lessees or mortgagors, changes in tax laws and regulations, changes in the financial position of our lessees and mortgagors and changes in economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital, which affect opportunities for profitable acquisitions, some of which are described from time to time in the SEC reports filed by the Company. Projections of earnings and FFO may not be updated until the next announcement of earnings, and events prior to the next announcement could render the expectations stale.
 
 
 
(1) We believe that Funds From Operations (FFO) is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between dividend payments and FFO to measure our desired payout ratio.
 
We adopted the definition of FFO prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' (NAREIT) October 1999 White Paper (as amended April 2002). FFO is defined as Net Income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and real estate related amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
 
FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income. FFO, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define it exactly as the NAREIT definition.
 
 
 
(1) Weighted average shares outstanding-Diluted FFO includes Weighted Average Shares Outstanding  Diluted EPS and convertible operating partnership units which are convertible into our common stock on a one-for-one basis.
 
 
 
 
 
 
INVESTMENT PORTOLIO
 
As of March 31, 2003, the Company's gross investment in properties, including partnership interests and mortgage loans, was approximately $ 3.1 billion.
 
ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS
 
Total new investments for the first quarter of 2003 are summarized as follows:
 
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the Company acquired six properties totaling approximately $22.4 million, with an average lease rate of 11.1%. These investments included five assisted living facilities and one health and wellness center. Also during the quarter, the Company completed a $9.5 million mezzanine loan secured by seven assisted living facilities with an interest rate of 13.5%.
 
As of March 31, 2003, the Company had commitments to acquire or construct an additional $62 million of health care real estate and capital projects.
 
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
 
During the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the Company sold four facilities, of which three were vacant, for a net sales price of $9.1 million resulting in a net gain of $2.6 million. Additionally, the Company recognized $8.8 million of impairment losses on 11 facilities, nine of which are vacant. As of March 31, 2003, the Company has a total of 11 vacant facilities. Costs associated with these 11 vacant facilities are approximately $70,000 per month.
 
 
Discontinued Operations
 
The following table presents the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 after giving effect to assets qualifying for reclassification as discontinued operations during the quarter ended March 31, 2003, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." The reclassification has no impact on Net Income, Funds From Operations (FFO) or per share amounts.
 
 
PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AND MAJOR OPERATORS
 
HOSPITAL PORTFOLIO
 
The Company currently derives 29% of its annualized cash provided by leases and loans, or $101.5 million, from 31 hospitals.
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet") leases from the Company eight acute care hospitals and one medical office building in which HCPI has an aggregate investment of $460 million. Rents from these hospitals constitute approximately 16% of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans.
 
 
Tenet has announced its adoption of new policies as of January 1, 2003 for calculating Medicare reimbursement for patients who require high cost treatments ("outlier payments"). The Company estimates that, if payments at its eight Tenet operated hospitals are reduced in proportion to Tenet's announcement, rents paid to the Company would decrease by $500,000 per year, approximately $0.01 per diluted share of common stock, and the cash flow coverage of rents after management fees would decrease from 5.1 to 4.4.
 
The current terms of the leases for the eight hospitals leased to Tenet expire between February 2004 and May 2005. Under each of the leases, Tenet can provide notification six months prior to the expiration of the current term of its intent to renew the lease for five years under the existing terms or purchase the facility at fair market value. Within the past five years Tenet renewed the leases on each of the seven facilities that reached renewal or purchase option dates.
 
HealthSouth Corporation
 
Five percent of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans is generated from facilities leased to HealthSouth Corporation ("HealthSouth"), primarily from nine rehabilitation hospitals. In March 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged HealthSouth and its former chief executive officer with inflating earnings by $1.4 billion since 1999 and overstating assets by $800 million. Accordingly, due to the possible unreliability of the financial information reported by HealthSouth, we have adjusted our cash flow coverage and operating results presentation for our hospital portfolio to exclude HealthSouth results.
 
The average remaining lease term on the nine rehabilitation hospitals leased by HealthSouth is four years excluding renewal options. The average age of these hospitals is 14 years. First quarter 2003 occupancy on the nine facilities ranged from 60% to 97%, with an average occupancy of 81%. HealthSouth is current on all significant rent payments through April 2003.
 
LONG-TERM CARE PORTFOLIO
 
Twenty-five percent of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans is currently derived from the long-term care sector. Reduced reimbursements, a nursing shortage and increased liability insurance costs continue to challenge this sector. Certain temporary Medicare add-on payments enacted within The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 and Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefit and Protection Act of 2000 expired in October 2002. As a result, Medicare reimbursement to nursing homes declined approximately 9% as of October 1, 2002. Other add-on payments associated with certain classifications were scheduled to expire October 1, 2003. However, the Administration acted to preserve these payments until 2005. A planned limitation on Medicare Part B rehabilitation therapy procedures scheduled for January 1, 2003 has been delayed until July 1, 2003. If the proposed therapy cap is enacted, it is anticipated that Medicare reimbursement will be further reduced. Cash flow coverage of rents of the Company's long-term care facilities have been negatively affected as a result of the issues discussed above.
 
Centennial HealthCare Corporation
 
In late 2002, the Company sent default and lease termination notices to Centennial HealthCare Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries ("Centennial") for non-payment of rent under 17 leases and non-payment of
 
 
interest and principal under a secured loan, and to a third party lessee for non-payment of rent on three facilities managed by Centennial. In December 2002 Centennial filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
 
As of November 30, 2002, the total obligations of Centennial and the third party lessees under the 20 leases and the secured loan were approximately $900,000 per month. The Company's gross investment in the 20 leased facilities and the facility subject to the secured loan was approximately $67 million, and the book value of these properties, net of depreciation as of March 31, 2003, is approximately $42 million.
 
During the first quarter, the operations of five of the 20 leased facilities were transferred to other operators, with an additional six facilities expected to transition to new operators during the second quarter. The Company has reached an agreement in principle with Centennial for Centennial to retain the operations of eight facilities, although the Company cannot ensure that definitive agreements will be signed and approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The facility securing the loan and another facility are expected to be sold. During the quarter, the Company received rent for the properties of approximately $510,000 per month. In addition, the Company received rents of $520,000 on these facilities for April 2003. Monthly revenue attributable to the facilities is expected to be approximately $550,000 per month after all lease arrangements and sales are finalized, representing a revenue decrease of $350,000 per month or approximately $0.07 per diluted share of common stock annually.
 
Sun Healthcare Group, Inc.
 
During the quarter, Sun Healthcare Group ("Sun"), which had directly leased from the Company four facilities, subleased two facilities and managed three facilities, communicated to the Company that alternative operators should be found and that it would not pay rent after January 2003 on these facilities. The monthly rent for the nine facilities was approximately $460,000 per month in 2002. The Company received approximately $255,000 in rent for each of February and March 2003 attributable to these properties. The Company has reached agreements to lease four facilities with operations expected to transfer during the second quarter of 2003. New subleases are in process on the two subleased facilities and are expected to transition to the new subtenant in the second quarter of 2003. The three facilities previously managed by Sun have been moved to another operator and no rent diminution is expected. Monthly revenue for the nine facilities is expected to be approximately $400,000 per month after all lease arrangements are finalized, representing a revenue decrease of $60,000 per month or approximately $0.01 per diluted share of common stock annually.
 
RETIREMENT AND ASSISTED LIVING PORTFOLIO
 
The Company currently derives 22% of its annualized cash provided by leases and loans from the retirement and assisted living industry. The assisted living component of this sector has been challenged by overbuilding, slow fill-up, rising insurance costs and higher operating costs associated with increased acuity of residents. However, occupancy rates, monthly payment rates, and bottom line performance, including cash flow coverage on rents, are improving.
 
 
American Retirement Corporation
 
As of March 31, 2003, the Company had $203 million invested in retirement living communities leased to or collateralized by assets operated by American Retirement Corporation ("ARC"). These investments include six leased properties and a $125 million investment in a subsidiary of ARC, ARCPI Holdings, Inc. ("ARCPI"). The investment in ARCPI is comprised of 1) a $113 million, 19.5% loan (due 2007 with prepayment option in 2005 and a current pay rate of 9%) collateralized by ARC's 90.2% interest in nine retirement living communities and 2) a $12 million equity investment in the remaining 9.8% ownership interest in ARCPI.
 
The Company derives approximately $8.5 million in lease revenue and $16.2 million in interest and equity income annually from the $203 million investment in ARC properties. Interest and equity income recognized from the $125 million investment in ARCPI is affected by the operating results of the nine underlying retirement living communities. Based upon the Company's analysis of the loan to asset value underlying the investment, we are recording interest income at approximately 13% on the $113 million loan. As of March 31, 2003, $2.4 million of accrued interest receivable has been recorded, representing the difference between the accrual rate and the pay rate.
 
MANAGED MEDICAL OFFICE, HEALTH CARE LABORATORY AND BIOTECH RESEARCH, AND PHYSICIAN GROUP PRACTICE CLINIC PORTFOLIO
 
The Company's 4.3 million square foot managed medical office, health care laboratory and biotech research, and physician group practice clinic portfolio currently produces approximately 16.9% of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans. Net Operating Income (NOI), (defined as Rental Income, Managed Properties net of Managed Properties Operating Expenses) for the first quarter 2003 increased by $393,000 from the first quarter 2002 due to 2002 acquisitions. The occupancy level within this portfolio was 93% at both March 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002.
 
FUTURE OPERATIONS
 
The Company projects Diluted Funds From Operations (FFO) for 2003 to range between $3.51 and $3.59 per share. Diluted FFO for 2003 is predicated on a diluted earnings per share range of $2.05 to $2.08 adjusted, in accordance with the NAREIT definition of FFO, for real estate depreciation of $1.28 to $1.33, net gains or losses on real estate dispositions of $0.10 and dividends on operating partnership units of $0.08.
 
CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY
 
On February 28, 2003 the Company raised $200 million through the issuance of 6% senior unsecured notes due 2015. Proceeds were utilized to fund acquisitions and for repayment of indebtedness. During the quarter, the Company redeemed $5 million in Medium Term Notes due March 10, 2015, which carried an interest rate of 9%, and paid off $30 million of maturing Medium Term Notes with an aggregate interest rate of 7.11%.

Since implementation of the DRIP in March 2001, approximately $138 million has been raised through the issuance of new common equity under the DRIP.
 
 
On March 28, 2003, the Company announced that it will redeem all of its outstanding 8.6% series C preferred stock on May 2, 2003. The amount payable to redeem the preferred stock will be approximately $99.4 million plus accrued dividends.
 
Borrowings under the Company's $490 million three-year revolving line of credit were $102.2 million as of March 31, 2003 and averaged $199 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, at a rate of 2.17%. Average bank interest rates were 2.74% for the first quarter of 2002.
