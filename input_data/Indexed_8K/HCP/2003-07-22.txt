These statements relate to, among other things, projections of Diluted Funds From Operations, Diluted Earnings Per Share, Real Estate Depreciation, Net Gains or Losses on Real Estate Dispositions and Dividends on Operating Partnership Units. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as competition for the acquisition and financing of health care facilities, competition for lessees and mortgagors (including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or roll-over of existing leases), continuing operational difficulties in the long-term care and assisted living sectors, the ability to acquire, sell or lease facilities and the timing of acquisitions, sales and leasings, changes in health care regulations and other changes in the health care industry which affect the operations of the Company's lessees or mortgagors, changes in the financial position of the Company's lessees and mortgagors and changes in economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital, which affect opportunities for profitable acquisitions, some of which are described from time to time in the SEC reports filed by the Company.

The Company adopted the definition of FFO prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' (NAREIT) October 1999 White Paper (as amended April 2002). FFO is defined as Net Income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and real estate related amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
 
FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income. FFO, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define it exactly as the NAREIT definition.

Supplemental Financial and Operating Information
As of June 30, 2003
 
INVESTMENT PORTOLIO
 
As of June 30, 2003, the Company's gross investment in properties, including partnership interests and mortgage loans, was approximately $3.1 billion.
 
ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS
 
Total new investments for the six months ended June 30, 2003 are summarized as follows:
 
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2003, the Company acquired one medical office building for $4.2 million with a lease rate of 10%. During the first quarter of 2003 the Company acquired a total of six properties totaling approximately $22.4 million, with an average lease rate of 11.1% and completed a $9.5 million mezzanine loan secured by seven assisted living facilities with an interest rate of 13.5%.
 
On June 2, 2003, the Company formed a joint venture with GE Commercial Finance to buy up to $600 million of medical office buildings in the United States. The Company has a 33% economic interest in the new company, HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC. As of June 30, 2003, no assets had been acquired by the joint venture.
 
As of June 30, 2003, the Company had contractual commitments to acquire or construct an additional $56 million of health care real estate and capital projects. The Company expects that a significant portion of these commitments will be funded; however, experience suggests that some committed transactions may not close for various reasons including unsatisfied closing conditions, competitive financing sources, final negotiation differences or the operator's inability to obtain required internal or governmental approvals.
 
DISPOSITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2003, the Company sold five facilities for a net sales price of $5.2 million resulting in a net gain on sale of $400,000.

For the six months ended June 30, 2003, a total of nine facilities have been sold for a net sales price of $14.3 million and a net gain on sale of $3 million.

The following table presents the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 after giving effect to assets classified as discontinued operations during the six months ended June 30, 2003, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." The classification has no impact on Net Income, Funds From Operations (FFO) or per share amounts.
 
 
 
REVIEW OF PORTFOLIO AND SELECTED OPERATORS
 
HOSPITAL PORTFOLIO
 
The Company currently derives 29% of its annualized cash provided by leases and loans, or $102 million, from 31 hospitals within its portfolio.
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet") leases from the Company eight acute care hospitals and one medical office building in which Health Care Property Investors has an aggregate investment of $460 million. Rents from these hospitals constitute approximately 16% of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans.
 
Tenet announced its adoption of new policies as of January 1, 2003 for calculating Medicare reimbursement for patients who require high cost treatments ("outlier payments"). Health Care Property Investors previously estimated that, if payments at its eight Tenet operated hospitals are reduced in proportion to Tenet's announcement, rents paid to the Company would decrease by $500,000 per year, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share of common stock, and the cash flow coverage of rents after management fees would decrease from 5.1 to 4.4. Net Tenet rents were $13.9 million and $14.0 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002, respectively, and cash flow coverage of rents have decreased to 4.4 for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Tenet is currently undergoing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to its billing practices and financial and other disclosures. In addition, according to recent public disclosures by Tenet, the United States Department of Justice is suing Tenet over Medicare fraud allegations; the U.S. Attorney's office is investigating Tenet's use of physician relocation agreements; a federal grand jury has returned an indictment accusing a subsidiary of Tenet of illegal use of physician relocation agreements; the Internal Revenue Service has assessed a $157 million tax deficiency against Tenet; Tenet is litigating several federal securities class action and shareholder derivative suites; and Tenet is subject to other federal investigations regarding its business practices. The Company cannot predict the impact, if any, that these recent developments may have on individual hospital performance and the related rent.
 
The current terms of the leases for the eight hospitals leased to Tenet expire on February 19, 2004 for six hospitals, on May 31, 2004 for the seventh hospital and on May 31, 2005 for the eighth hospital. Under each of the leases Tenet can provide notification six months prior to the expiration of the current term of its intent to renew the lease for five years under the existing terms. In addition, Tenet has the right to purchase up to six of the facilities at fair market value at the expiration of the lease terms. Within the past five years Tenet renewed the leases on each of the seven facilities that reached renewal or purchase option dates.
 
HealthSouth Corporation
 
Five percent of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans is generated from facilities leased to HealthSouth Corporation ("HealthSouth"), primarily from nine rehabilitation hospitals. In March 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged HealthSouth and its former chief executive officer with inflating earnings and overstating assets. HealthSouth has announced that it is undergoing a financial audit and forensic examination to assess the accuracy of its financial information. The nine rehabilitation hospitals leased by HealthSouth have an average remaining lease term of four years not taking into account renewal options. The average age of these hospitals is 14 years. Second quarter 2003 occupancy on the nine facilities, as provided by HealthSouth, ranged from 63% to 97%, with an average occupancy of 79%. HealthSouth is current on rent payments through July 2003.
 
The Company is excluding HealthSouth's results from cash flow coverage and operating results presentation for the hospital portfolio until greater assurances about HealthSouth's financial information are received.
 
LONG-TERM CARE PORTFOLIO
 
The Company currently derives 25% of its annualized cash provided by leases and loans, or $86 million, from the long-term care sector. Reduced reimbursements, a nursing shortage and increased liability insurance costs continue to challenge this sector and have caused a diminution in cash flow coverage.
 
Certain temporary Medicare add-on payments expired in October 2002 causing a decline in Medicare reimbursement to nursing homes of approximately 9% as of October 1, 2002. A planned limitation on Medicare Part B rehabilitation therapy procedures is scheduled for September 1, 2003 and would further reduce Medicare reimbursement.
 
However, partially offsetting the foregoing, the annual market basket increase to Medicare rates for long-term care facilities is expected to take effect October 1, 2003, and is expected to be further supplemented by an accumulated administrative adjustment for prior years, resulting in an aggregate 6% increase in Medicare rates.
 
Centennial HealthCare Corporation
 
In late 2002, the Company sent default and lease termination notices to Centennial HealthCare Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries ("Centennial") for non-payment of rent under 17 leases and non-payment of interest and principal under a secured loan, and to a third party lessee for non-payment of rent on three facilities managed by Centennial. In December 2002, Centennial filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. As of November 30, 2002, the total obligations of Centennial and the third party lessees under the 20 leases and the secured loan were approximately $900,000 per month.
 
The Company's gross investment in the 20 leased facilities and the facility subject to the secured loan was approximately $67 million, and the book value of these properties, net of depreciation as of June 30, 2003, was approximately $40 million. During the first half of 2003, the Company successfully transitioned the operations of 11 of the 20 leased facilities to new tenants. Eight facilities are scheduled to remain with Centennial and one facility is for sale. During the second quarter, the Company received rent for the properties of approximately $530,000 per month. Monthly revenue attributable to the facilities is expected to be approximately $550,000 per month after all lease arrangements and sales are finalized, representing a revenue decrease of $350,000 per month, or approximately $0.07 per diluted share of common stock annually.
 
Sun Healthcare Group, Inc.
 
Sun Healthcare Group ("Sun") previously directly leased from the Company four facilities, subleased two facilities and managed three facilities. Sun ceased paying rent on these facilities in January 2003. The monthly rent for the nine facilities was approximately $460,000 per month during 2002. The four facilities leased directly from the Company transitioned to other operators during the second quarter of 2003. The two subleased facilities are now expected to transition to the new subtenant during the third quarter of 2003. The three facilities previously managed by Sun have been moved to another operator and no rent diminution is expected. Monthly revenue from the nine facilities averaged $284,000 in the second quarter but is expected to be approximately $400,000 per month after all lease arrangements are finalized, representing a revenue decrease of $60,000 per month, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share of common stock annually.
 
ASSISTED AND RETIREMENT LIVING PORTFOLIO
 
The Company currently derives 22% of its annualized cash provided by leases and loans, or $77 million, from the assisted and retirement living industry. The assisted living component of this sector has been challenged by overbuilding, slow fill-up, rising insurance costs and higher operating costs associated with increased acuity of residents. However, occupancy rates, monthly payment rates, and bottom line performance, have been improving.
 
MANAGED MEDICAL OFFICE, HEALTH CARE LABORATORY AND BIOTECH RESEARCH, AND PHYSICIAN GROUP PRACTICE CLINIC PORTFOLIO
 
The Company's 4.2 million square foot managed medical office, health care laboratory and biotech research, and physician group practice clinic portfolio currently produces approximately 17% of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans. Net Operating Income (NOI) (defined as Rental Income, Managed Properties net of Managed Properties Operating Expenses) for the second quarter 2003 increased by $1,081,000 from the second quarter 2002 due to 2002 acquisitions and internal growth. The occupancy level within this portfolio was 94% at June 30, 2003.
 
FUTURE OPERATIONS
 
The Company projects Diluted Funds From Operations (FFO) for 2003 to range between $3.51 and $3.59 per share. Diluted FFO for 2003 is based on a diluted earnings per share range of $2.05 to $2.12 adjusted, in accordance with the NAREIT definition of FFO, for real estate depreciation of $1.24 to $1.25, net gains or losses on real estate dispositions of $0.14 and dividends on operating partnership units of $0.08.
 
CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2003, the Company raised $33.4 million, at an average price per share of $37.38, under its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP). During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company raised $58.1 million under the DRIP.
