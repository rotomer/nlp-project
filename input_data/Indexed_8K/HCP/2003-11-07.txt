Supplemental Financial and Operating Information
As of September 30, 2003
 
INVESTMENT PORTOLIO
 
As of September 30, 2003, the Company's gross investment in properties, including partnership interests and mortgage loans, was approximately $3.2 billion.
 
ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS
 
Total new investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003 are summarized as follows:
 
 
American Retirement Corporation
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company acquired four continuing care retirement communities from American Retirement Corporation (ARC) for $163.5 million. Prior to the acquisition, the Company owned a 9.8% equity interest in the entities that owned these four facilities. Three of the facilities have been leased to ARC. The fourth facility has been leased to a third party that has contracted with ARC to manage the facility. The leases have a ten-year term and an annual lease rate of 9.5% with annual rent increases of 2.75%. In addition, the Company closed a $7 million secured loan to ARC. ARC used the proceeds from these transactions to repay $113 million in first mortgage debt on the properties. After giving credit for Health Care Property Investors' existing minority interest in the properties valued at $3 million, transaction costs and reserves, the remaining net proceeds of $52 million were used by ARC to prepay a portion of Health Care Property Investors' existing mezzanine loan, including accrued interest.
 
In the periods prior to the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company accrued interest at 13.25% on its mezzanine loan to ARC and reserved the difference between 13.25% and the 19.5% contractual rate. During the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company recognized $1.8 million in interest income through the full repayment (including interest accrued to 19.5%) of the portion of the mezzanine loan related to the four properties discussed in the preceding paragraph. The Company also reversed a portion of the reserves on the remaining $76 million mezzanine loan. The interest income generated related to such reversal was $2.9 million and
 
represents the difference between the Company's previous accrual rate of 13.25% and its current 16.5% accrual rate. The Company determines the accrual rate on the ARC mezzanine loan by evaluating the sufficiency of the net asset value (fair value of properties less first mortgage debt and other liabilities) of the Company's collateral.
 
MedCap Properties, LLC
 
On October 2, 2003, the Company and HCP Medical Office Portfolio, a joint venture that was formed in June 2003 by GE Commercial Finance and the Company, completed the $575 million acquisition of MedCap Properties, LLC, which includes ownership interests in 113 medical office buildings. The expected net operating income of the buildings is 9% of the acquisition price during the first twelve months. The acquisition was structured in three components.
 
HCP Medical Office Portfolio acquired 100 of the medical office buildings at an acquisition price of $460 million. The Company is the managing member of HCP Medical Office Portfolio and has a one-third interest therein. In addition to the Company's indirect ownership interest in the medical office buildings through its joint venture interest, the Company will earn acquisition and management fees and an additional return if certain investment hurdles are achieved with respect to these properties. At the time of the acquisition, the joint venture assumed $26 million in mortgage debt at a rate of approximately 7%. The joint venture's future plans include additional mortgage financings that will be primarily long-term, fixed rate debt with a target leverage ratio of 70%.
 
Eight of the acquired medical office buildings, with an investment value of $49 million, were contributed to a joint venture between the Company and senior MedCap management. The joint venture issued 1,064,539 units valued at $45.26 each, which are redeemable for cash or, at the Company's option, HCPI common stock beginning October 2, 2004.
 
The remaining five buildings are construction projects acquired by the Company with scheduled completion dates in 2004 and an expected total cost of $67 million. These assets will be acquired by HCP Medical Office Portfolio upon completion of construction.
 
Acquisition and Construction Commitments
 
As of September 30, 2003, the Company had contractual commitments to acquire or construct an additional $54 million of health care real estate and capital projects excluding the $67 million of construction projects related to the MedCap Properties, LLC acquisition noted above. The Company expects that a significant portion of these commitments will be funded; however, experience suggests that some committed transactions may not close for various reasons including unsatisfied closing conditions, competitive financing sources, final negotiation differences or the operator's inability to obtain required internal or governmental approvals.
 
DISPOSITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company sold five facilities for a net sales price of $12.5 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of $5.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, a total of 14 facilities have been sold for a net sales price of $26.8 million
 
and a net gain on sale of $8.1 million. The Company recognized a total of $11.7 million of impairment losses on 13 facilities during the first nine months of the year, but no impairment losses were recognized during the third quarter.
 
As of September 30, 2003, the Company had 16 facilities classified as discontinued operations that it had not yet sold. The following table presents the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 after giving effect to assets classified as discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2003, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." The classification has no impact on Net Income or Funds From Operations (FFO).
 
 
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 (FAS 150) "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." FAS 150 would require that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments be classified as a liability and valued at the instruments' settlement value as of the balance sheet date. As a result, consolidated partnerships with a limited life would be considered mandatorily redeemable and therefore fall under FAS 150.
 
On October 29, 2003, the FASB met and voted to defer implementation of the provisions of FAS 150 that require the valuation and establishment of a liability for limited life partnerships. Thus, any impact from FAS 150 has been excluded from the Company's operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003.
 
REVIEW OF PORTFOLIO AND SELECTED OPERATORS
 
HOSPITAL PORTFOLIO
 
The Company currently derives 27% of its annualized cash provided by leases and loans (see definition in Footnote 1 under the Supplementary Financial Information Portfolio Overview table), or $100 million, from the 31 hospitals within its portfolio.
 
Tenet Healthcare Corporation
 
As of September 30, 2003, Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet") leased from the Company eight acute care hospitals and one medical office building in which Health Care Property Investors has an aggregate investment of $460 million. Rents from these hospitals constitute approximately 16% of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans. While two of the hospital leases are scheduled to expire on May 31, 2004 and May 31, 2005, Tenet can renew the leases for an additional five years by providing notice six months prior to lease expiration. Tenet exercised five year extensions on the six facility leases with current terms set to expire in February 2004. In October 2003, Tenet transferred one of these six facility leases for a hospital located in Poplar Bluff, Missouri to Health Management Associates (HMA). HMA is a strong health care services operator with hospitals concentrated primarily in the southeast and southwest areas of the United States. Current annual rent on the hospital is $3.7 million.
 
Tenet has recently informed the Company that one of the Company's hospitals located in Tarzana, California, and operated by Tenet under a lease which was recently renewed for an additional five years is affected by State of California Senate Bill 1953 (SB 1953), which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital facilities. The Company and Tenet are currently reviewing the SB 1953 compliance of this hospital, multiple plans of action to cause such compliance, the estimated time for completing the same and the cost of performing necessary remediation of the property. The Company cannot currently estimate the potential costs of SB 1953 compliance with respect to the affected hospital or the final allocation of such costs between the Company and Tenet. Current annual rent on the hospital is $10.8 million and the net book value is $81 million.
 
Tenet announced its adoption of new policies, as of January 1, 2003, for calculating Medicare reimbursement for patients who require high cost treatments ("outlier payments"). Net Tenet rents were $13.9 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002. Cash flow coverage of rents decreased to 4.6 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2003. This is down from a coverage level of 5.1 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2002.
 
Tenet is currently undergoing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to its billing practices and financial and other disclosures. In addition, according to public disclosures by Tenet, the United States Department of Justice is suing Tenet over
 
Medicare fraud allegations; the U.S. Attorney's office is investigating Tenet's use of physician relocation agreements and Medicare outlier payments; a federal grand jury has returned an indictment accusing a subsidiary of Tenet of illegal use of physician relocation agreements; the Internal Revenue Service has assessed a $157 million tax deficiency against Tenet; the United States Senate Finance Committee is investigating Tenant's corporate governance practices with respect to federal health care programs; Tenet is litigating several federal securities class action and shareholder derivative suits and several state law actions; a former executive of Tenet recently received a $253 million judgment against Tenet for certain stock incentive awards; and Tenet is subject to other federal and state investigations regarding its business practices. Tenet is responding to a Justice Department subpoena regarding the outlier payments at the Company's Tarzana facility. The Company cannot predict the impact, if any, that these recent developments may have on individual hospital performance and the related rent.
 
HealthSouth Corporation
 
Five percent of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans is generated from facilities leased to HealthSouth Corporation ("HealthSouth"), primarily from nine rehabilitation hospitals. In March 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged HealthSouth and its former chief executive officer with inflating earnings and overstating assets. HealthSouth has announced that it is undergoing a financial audit and forensic examination to assess the accuracy of its financial information. In October 2003, HealthSouth announced that it paid its semi-annual interest payments to bondholders and announced its intention to remain current on all interest payments. The nine rehabilitation hospitals leased by HealthSouth have an average remaining lease term of four years not taking into account renewal options. The average age of these hospitals is 14 years. Third quarter 2003 occupancy on the nine facilities, as provided by HealthSouth, ranged from 56% to 99%, with an average occupancy of 75%. HealthSouth is current on rent payments through October 2003.
 
The Company is excluding HealthSouth's results from cash flow coverage and operating results presentation for the hospital portfolio until greater assurances about HealthSouth's financial information are received.
 
LONG-TERM CARE PORTFOLIO
 
The Company currently derives 24% of its annualized cash provided by leases and loans, or $87 million, from the long-term care sector. Reduced reimbursements, a nursing shortage and increased liability insurance costs continue to challenge this sector and have caused a diminution in cash flow coverage.
 
Certain temporary Medicare add-on payments expired in October 2002 causing a decline in Medicare reimbursement to nursing homes of approximately 9% as of October 1, 2002. A planned limitation on Medicare Part B rehabilitation therapy procedures went into effect September 1, 2003 and further reduced Medicare reimbursement. However, the annual market basket increase to Medicare rates for long-term care facilities took effect October 1, 2003, partially offsetting the forgoing, and resulting in an aggregate 6% increase in Medicare rates. In addition, most state Medicaid rates were increased slightly providing further revenue and sector stabilization.
 
Centennial HealthCare Corporation
 
In late 2002, the Company sent default and lease termination notices to Centennial HealthCare Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries ("Centennial") for non-payment of rent under 17 leases and non-payment of interest and principal under a secured loan, and to a third party lessee for non-payment of rent on three facilities managed by Centennial. In December 2002, Centennial filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. As of November 30, 2002, the total obligations of Centennial and the third party lessees under the 20 leases and the secured loan were approximately $900,000 per month.
 
The Company's gross investment in the 20 leased facilities and the facility subject to the secured loan was approximately $67 million, and the book value of these properties, net of depreciation as of September 30, 2003, was approximately $40 million. During 2003, the Company successfully transitioned the operations of 11 of the 20 leased facilities to new tenants. Eight facilities are expected to remain with Centennial and one facility is for sale. During the third quarter, the Company received rent for the properties of approximately $530,000 per month. Monthly revenue attributable to the facilities is expected to be approximately $550,000 per month after all lease arrangements and sales are finalized, representing a revenue decrease of $350,000 per month, or approximately $0.07 per diluted share of common stock annually.
 
RETIREMENT AND ASSISTED LIVING PORTFOLIO
 
The Company currently derives 25% of its annualized cash provided by leases and loans, or $90 million, from the retirement and assisted living industry. The assisted living component of this sector is experiencing high vacancies and high insurance costs. However, some occupancies, resident monthly payment rates and bottom line performance have been improving. The retirement component of this sector continues to experience relatively strong census levels as well as bottom line performance.
 
MANAGED MEDICAL OFFICE, HEALTH CARE LABORATORY AND BIOTECH RESEARCH, AND PHYSICIAN GROUP PRACTICE CLINIC PORTFOLIO
 
The Company's 4.2 million square foot managed medical office, health care laboratory and biotech research, and physician group practice clinic portfolio currently produces approximately 16% of the Company's annualized cash provided by leases and loans. Net Operating Income (NOI), defined as Rental Income, Managed Properties net of Managed Properties Operating Expenses, for the third quarter 2003 increased by $1,148,000 from the third quarter 2002 due to 2002 acquisitions and internal growth. The occupancy level within this portfolio was 94% at September 30, 2003.
 
FUTURE OPERATIONS
 
The Company projects Diluted Funds From Operations (FFO) for 2003 to range between $3.25 and $3.27 per share including a $0.29 per share charge related to preferred stock redemptions. Diluted FFO for 2003 is based on diluted earnings per share adjusted in accordance with the NAREIT definition of FFO as detailed in the following table:
 
 
CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY
 
DEBT FINANCING
 
On February 28, 2003 the Company raised gross proceeds of $200 million through the issuance of 6% senior unsecured notes due 2015. Proceeds were utilized to fund acquisitions and for repayment of indebtedness.
 
Borrowings under the Company's $490 million three-year revolving line of credit were $129 million as of September 30, 2003, and averaged $86 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, at an average interest rate of 1.89%. The average bank interest rate was 2.53% for the third quarter of 2002 and average borrowings were $89 million for the same period.

Preferred Stock Redemptions
 
On May 2, 2003, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 8.6% series C preferred stock. The amount paid to redeem the preferred stock was approximately $99.4 million plus accrued dividends. The redemption of the series C preferred stock gave rise to a non-operating charge of $11.8 million in the second quarter.
 
On September 10, 2003, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 7.875% series A preferred stock. The amount paid to redeem the series A preferred stock was approximately $60.9 million plus accrued dividends. The redemption of the series A preferred stock gave rise to a non-operating charge of $2.2 million in the third quarter.
 
On August 28, 2003, the Company announced it would redeem all of its outstanding 8.7% series B preferred stock. The preferred stock balance was reclassified to Redeemable Preferred Stock liability at its settlement value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." On October 1, 2003, the Company redeemed the series B preferred stock. The amount paid to redeem the series B preferred stock was approximately $133.7 million plus accrued dividends. The redemption of the series B preferred stock gave rise to a non-operating charge of $4.6 million in the third quarter.
 
The redemption charges have no impact on net income but are reflected in earnings per common share.
 
COMMON STOCK
 
On July 10, 2003, the Company issued 1,400,000 shares of common stock at a net offering price of $41.50 per share, generating gross proceeds of $58,100,000.
