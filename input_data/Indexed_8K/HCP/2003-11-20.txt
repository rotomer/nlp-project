Item 5.    Other Events
 
On November 19, 2003, we commenced a medium-term note program for the possible issuance, from time to time, of up to $100,000,000 of medium-term notes, Series E, pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-86654, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 10, 2002.
 
On November 19, 2003, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., (the "Distribution Agreement") pursuant to which we appointed each of them as our agent for the purpose of soliciting and receiving offers to purchase the medium-term notes. In addition, any agent may also purchase medium-term notes as principal pursuant to a terms agreement relating to the applicable sale.
 
The medium-term notes are issuable pursuant to an Indenture dated as of September 1, 1993, by and between us and The Bank of New York (the "Indenture"). In connection with the commencement of our medium-term note program and pursuant to the Indenture, we delivered an Officers' Certificate dated November 19, 2003 (the "Officers' Certificate") to The Bank of New York setting forth the terms of the medium-term notes.
 
We are filing with this current report the Distribution Agreement, the Officers' Certificate, a form of fixed rate medium-term note, a form of floating rate medium-term note, the opinions of legal counsel relating to the issuance of the medium-term notes and the statement regarding computation of ratios.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
                    Incorporated
Credit Suisse First Boston LLC
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
Goldman, Sachs & Co.
 
Dear Sirs:
 
Health Care Property Investors, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (each an "Agent" and, collectively, the "Agents") with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of its Medium-Term Notes described herein (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture", which term as used herein includes any instrument establishing the form and terms of the Notes) dated as of September 1, 1993 between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee").
 
As of the date hereof, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of up to $100,000,000 aggregate initial offering price of Notes to or through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of additional Notes and that such additional Notes may be sold to or distributed through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date hereof.
 
This Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company to one or more of the Agents as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers and for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to investors (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and the applicable Agent) in which case the applicable Agent will act as agent of the Company in soliciting Note purchases.
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-86654) for the registration of $975,000,000 aggregate offering price of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, and debt securities, including the Notes, as amended by Amendment Nos. 1, 2 and 3, thereto dated May 21, 2002, June 7, 2002 and June 10, 2002, respectively, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (such rules and regulations, the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been declared effective by the Commission and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). Such registration statement (and any further registration statements which may be filed by the Company for the purpose of registering additional Notes and in connection with which this Agreement is included or incorporated by reference as an exhibit) and the prospectus constituting a part thereof, and any prospectus supplements relating to the Notes, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time amended or supplemented by the filing of documents pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), the 1933 Act or otherwise, are referred to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus", respectively, except that if any revised prospectus and/or prospectus supplement relating to the Notes shall be provided to the Agents by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Notes, whether or not such revised prospectus and/or prospectus supplement relating to the Notes is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus and/or prospectus supplement relating to the Notes from and after the time it is first provided to the Agents for such use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement any prospectus supplement prepared with respect to the offering of a series of debt securities other than the Notes shall not be deemed to have supplemented the Prospectus.
 
SECTION 1. .
Appointment as Agent
 
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to appoint, upon two business days' prior written notice to the Agents, additional persons as "Agents" hereunder (provided that each such additional person agrees to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement (including Schedule A)), the Company hereby agrees that Notes will be sold exclusively to or through the Agents. Each Agent is authorized to engage the services of any other broker or dealer in connection with the offer or sale of the Notes purchased by such Agent as principal for resale to others but is not authorized to appoint sub-agents. In connection with sales by the Agents of Notes purchased by the Agents as principal to other brokers or dealers, the Agents may allot any portion of the discount they have received in connection with such purchase from the Company to such brokers or dealers. The Company agrees that during the period the Agents are acting as the Company's agents hereunder, the Company will not contact or solicit potential investors to purchase the Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may accept offers to purchase Notes through an agent other than the Agents if (i) the Company shall not have solicited such offers, (ii) the Company and such agent shall have entered into an agreement with the same terms as this Agreement (including Schedule A) and (iii) the Company shall have notified the Agents promptly after the acceptance of any such offer and shall have provided the Agents with a copy of such agreement in written form promptly following the execution thereof.
Appointment
 
(b) . The Company shall not sell or approve the solicitation of purchases of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized by the Company from time to time or in excess of the principal amount of Notes registered pursuant to the Registration Statement. The Agents will have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold, or of otherwise monitoring the availability of Notes for sale, under the Registration Statement.
Sale of Notes
 
(c) . No Agent shall have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, but each Agent may agree from time to time to purchase Notes as principal. Any such purchase of Notes by an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof.
Purchases as Principal
 
(d) . If agreed upon by an Agent and the Company, such Agent acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal will solicit purchases of the Notes. Such Agent will communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each reasonable offer to purchase Notes solicited by such Agent on an agency basis, other than those offers rejected by such Agent. Such Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of Notes, as a whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of such Agent's agreement contained herein. The Company may accept or reject any proposed purchase of the Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of the Company's agreement contained herein. Such Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company. Such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such agency purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold such Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to such Agent any commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale.
Solicitations as Agent
 
(e) . The Company and the Agents agree that any Notes purchased by an Agent shall be purchased, and any Notes the placement of which an Agent arranges shall be placed by such Agent, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.

If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discount or commissions received by each applicable Agent, as the case may be, bears to the aggregate initial offering price of such Notes.
 
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the applicable Agent(s) and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the applicable Agent(s) agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, (i) no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount or commission received by such Agent in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any applicable untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In addition, in connection with an offering of Notes purchased from the Company by two or more Agents as principal, the respective obligations of such Agents to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Notes that each such Agent has agreed to purchase from the Company.
 
For purposes of this Section 9, each person, if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Section 10.

(a) The preparation and filing of the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto;
 
(b) The preparation, filing and reproduction of this Agreement;

(f) The qualification of the Notes under state securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(i) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agents in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky Survey and any Legal Investment Survey;
 
(g) The printing and delivery to the Agents in quantities as hereinabove stated of copies of the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto, and of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto (including all documents incorporated by reference therein), and the delivery by the Agents of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto in connection with solicitations or confirmations of sales of the Notes;
 
(h) The preparation, printing, reproducing and delivery to the Agents of copies of the Indenture and all supplements and amendments thereto;
 
(i) Any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Notes;
 
(j) Any advertising and other out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents incurred with the approval of the Company;
 
(k) The cost of providing any CUSIP or other identification numbers for the Notes; and
 
(l) The fees and expenses of any Depositary (as defined in the Indenture) and any nominees thereof in connection with the Notes.
 
SECTION 11.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery.
 
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents or any controlling person of any Agent, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Notes and the termination of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 12.
Termination.
 
(a) . This Agreement (excluding any agreement hereunder by one or more Agents to purchase Notes as principal) may be terminated for any reason, at any time by either the Company or an Agent, as to itself, upon the giving of ten days' written notice of such termination to the other party hereto.
Termination of this Agreement
 
(b) . The applicable Agent(s) may terminate any agreement hereunder by such Agent(s) to purchase Notes as principal, immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto (i) if there has been since the date of such agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States, any outbreak of hostilities or other calamity or crisis or change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of such Agent(s), impracticable to market the Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes, (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the NASDAQ National Market has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been
Termination of Agreement to Purchase Notes as Principal
 
fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by order of the Commission, the NASD or any other governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either federal, New York, Maryland or California authorities, (v) if the rating assigned by any nationally recognized securities rating agency to any debt securities of the Company as of the date of any applicable principal purchase shall have been lowered since that date or if any such rating agency shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company, or (vi) if there shall have come to such Agent(s) attention any facts that would cause such Agent(s) to believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of Notes, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.
 
. In the event of any such termination, neither party will have any liability to the other party hereto, except that (i) the Agents shall be entitled to any commission earned in accordance with the third paragraph of Section 3(b) hereof, (ii) if at the time of termination (a) any Agent shall own any Notes purchased by it as principal with the intention of reselling them or (b) an offer to purchase any of the Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto has not occurred, the covenants set forth in Sections 4 and 7 hereof shall remain in effect until such Notes are so resold or delivered, as the case may be, and (iii) the covenant set forth in Section 4(h) hereof, the provisions of Section 10 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Sections 8 and 9 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 11, 14 and 15 hereof shall remain in effect.

On and after the Initial Redemption Date, if any, this Note may be redeemed at any time in whole or from time to time in part in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal hereof shall be at least $1,000) at the option of the Company at the applicable Redemption Price (as defined below) together with accrued interest hereon at the applicable rate payable to the date of redemption (each such date, a "Redemption Date"), on written notice to the Holder hereof given not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the surrender hereof.

This Note may be subject to repayment at the option of the Holder on any Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, indicated above. If no Optional Repayment Date(s) are set forth above, this Note may not be so repaid at the option of the Holder hereof prior to the Stated Maturity Date.
