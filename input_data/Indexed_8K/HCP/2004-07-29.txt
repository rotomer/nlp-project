HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC. REPORTS RESULTS FOR
 
THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2004
 
LONG BEACH, CA, July 29, 2004  Health Care Property Investors, Inc. (NYSE:HCP), a health care real estate investment trust ("REIT"), today announced operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 totaled $36.3 million, or $0.27 per diluted share of common stock. This compares with net income applicable to common shares of $20.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted share of common stock for the quarter ended June 30, 2003.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO") was $58.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. This compares with FFO of $40.0 million, or $0.33 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Prior to asset impairment charges, FFO was $0.45 and $0.35 per diluted share for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
The Company has revised its presentation of FFO for all periods to include the effect of asset impairment charges, consistent with recent clarifications from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). For the second quarter of 2004 and 2003, asset impairments reduced FFO by $2.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measurement used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate investment trusts.

The Company believes that Funds From Operations (FFO) and Diluted Funds From Operations per share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
 
The Company defines FFO as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income. A reconciliation of net income applicable to common shares to FFO is provided herein.
