"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: The statements contained in this release and in the supplement, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Examples of such forward looking statements include the Company's beliefs and statements regarding net income and FFO guidance for fiscal year 2005. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include competition for the acquisition and financing of health care facilities, competition for lessees and mortgagors (including new leases and mortgages and the renewal or roll-over of existing leases); continuing operational difficulties in the skilled nursing and assisted living sectors; the Company's ability to acquire, sell or lease facilities and the timing of acquisitions, sales and leasings; changes in health care laws and regulations and other changes in the health care industry which affect the operations of the Company's lessees or mortgagors; changes in management; costs of compliance with building regulations; changes in tax laws and regulations; changes in the financial position of the Company's lessees and mortgagors; changes in rules governing financial reporting, including new accounting pronouncements; and changes in economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital, which affect opportunities for profitable investments. Some of these risks, and other risks, are described from time to time in Health Care Property Investors' Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
 
 
 
 
The Company defines FFO as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, and should not be considered an alternative to net income. A reconciliation of net income applicable to common shares to FFO is provided herein.
