NEWS RELEASE
 
HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC.
REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2005
 
LONG BEACH, CA, October 31, 2005  Health Care Property Investors, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:HCP), a healthcare real estate investment trust ("REIT"), today announced operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, was $39.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted share of common stock. This compares with net income applicable to common shares of $29.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share of common stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2004.  Net income applicable to common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, was $115.7 million, or $0.86 per diluted share of common stock, compared to $107.1 million, or $0.80 per diluted share of common stock in the year ago period.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares was $68.8 million, or $0.50 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, compared to FFO applicable to common shares of $48.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. FFO applicable to common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, was $192.0 million, or $1.41 per diluted share of common stock, compared to $160.9 million, or $1.21 per diluted share of common stock in the year ago period.  Prior to impairment charges, FFO applicable to common shares was $0.46 and $1.33 per diluted share of common stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, respectively.  No impairment charges were incurred in 2005.  FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is helpful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts.

PROJECTED FUTURE OPERATIONS (Full Year 2005):
 
 

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Health Care Property Investors, Inc., a Maryland corporation organized in 1985, is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") that, together with its consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, invests in healthcare related properties located throughout the United States.  The Company acquires healthcare facilities and leases them to healthcare providers.  Additionally, the Company provides mortgage financing on healthcare facilities.  References herein to "HCP," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" include Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, unless the context otherwise requires.
 
The Company is organized to invest in income-producing healthcare related facilities.  Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth.  Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles  opportunistic investing, portfolio diversification and conservative financing.
 
  The Company makes real estate investments that are expected to drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.  We attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations where we believe the opportunities meet our goals and investment criteria.  We invest in properties directly and through joint ventures, and provide secured financing, depending on the nature of the investment opportunity.
Opportunistic Investing.
 
  The Company believes in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare related real estate diversified by sector, geography, operator and investment product.  Diversification within the healthcare industry reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business.  This allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics.  While pursuing our strategy of attaining diversification in our portfolio, there are no specific limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property, property type, geographic location or in the number of properties in which we may invest, lease or lend to a single operator.
Portfolio Diversification.
 
  The Company believes a conservative balance sheet provides the ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach and portfolio diversification principles.  We maintain our conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining available sources of liquidity.  Our debt is primarily fixed rate, which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations.  Generally, we attempt to match the long-term duration of our leases with long-term fixed rate financing.
Conservative Financing.
 
As of September 30, 2005 the Company's portfolio of properties, excluding assets held for sale but including investments through joint ventures and mortgage loans, included 542 properties in 42 states and consisted of:
 
28 hospitals
 - 
                 
165 skilled nursing facilities
 - 
                 
138 assisted living and continuing care retirement communities
 - 
                 
184 medical office buildings
 - 
                 
27 other healthcare facilities
 -

.  Assisted living facility.
ALF
 
.  The most recent monthly interest and principal amortization due to HCP as of period end annualized for twelve months.  The Company uses Annualized Debt Service for purposes of determining Debt Service Coverage.
Annualized Debt Service
 
  The annualized future minimum rents due to HCP in the year of lease expiration.
Annualized Expiring Rent.
 
.  The most recent monthly base rent due to HCP as of period end annualized for twelve months plus additional rents received by HCP over the most recent twelve month period as of period end.  The Company uses Annualized Rent for purposes of determining property level Cash Flow Coverage.
Annualized Rent
 
.  Assets of discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, .
Assets Held for Sale
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
.  Hospitals and skilled nursing facilities are measured by licensed bed count.  ALFs and CCRCs are stated in units (e.g., studio, one or two bedroom units).  MOBs and other healthcare facilities are measured in square feet.
Beds/Units/Square Feet
 
.  The carrying amount as reported in the Company's financial statements.
Book Value
 
.  Facility level EBITDAR of the property's operator (not the Company) for the most recent twelve months of available data divided by the Annualized Rent.  Cash Flow Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate cash flow to meet related rent and other obligations to the Company.  However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR.  The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.  Results exclude data related to hospitals leased to HealthSouth until HealthSouth provides assurance about its financial information.  Results also exclude data related to ALFs leased to Emeritus since the operator has elected not to allocate the cost of a recent liability judgment to each of the facilities until the ultimate outcome of that judgment is clear.
Cash Flow Coverage
 
.  Continuing care retirement community.
CCRC
 
.  The periodic payment of interest expense and principal amortization on secured loans.
Debt Service
 
. Facility level EBITDAR of the property's operator (not the Company) for the most recent twelve months of available data divided by the Annualized Debt Service. Debt Service Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet related obligations to the Company under loan agreements.  However, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR.  The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. Results exclude data related to one ALF that secures a loan to Emeritus since the operator has elected not to allocate the cost of a recent liability judgment to this facility until the ultimate outcome of that judgment is clear.
Debt Service Coverage
 
.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for a particular facility accruing to the operator of the property (not the Company). The Company uses Facility EBITDAR in determining Debt Service Coverage and Cash Flow Coverage.  EBITDAR as an analytical tool has limitations similar to EBITDA.  However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's management.  The Company utilizes Facility EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.  Facility EBITDAR includes an imputed management fee of 2% for acute care hospitals and 5% for skilled nursing facilities, ALFs and CCRCs which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries.  All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by lessees and borrowers without verification by the Company.
Facility EBITDAR
 
.  For MOBs and other healthcare properties, facility occupancy represents the percentage of rentable square feet occupied. For hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ALFs and CCRCs, facility occupancy represents the facilities' operating occupancy for each quarter based on the most recent quarter of available data.  The percentages are calculated based on licensed beds, available beds and units for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ALFs and CCRCs, respectively.  The percentages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.  All facility financial performance data were derived solely from information provided by lessees and borrowers.
Facility Occupancy
 
.  Future minimum lease payments to be received by HCP, excluding operating expense reimbursements, from lessees under non-cancelable operating leases as of period end.
Future Minimum Rents
 
.  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
GAAP
 
.  HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture formed between the Company and an affiliate of General Electric Company ("GE"), for which the Company is managing member and has a 33% interest therein.
HCP MOP
 
The carrying amount of real estate assets, including intangibles, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization and the carrying amount of mortgage loans receivable.  Excludes assets held for sale and classified as discontinued operations.
Investment. 
 
.  The total number of outstanding shares of the Company's common stock and convertible partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end plus the total number of outstanding shares of the Company's preferred stock multiplied by the closing price of its preferred stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end.
Market Equity
 
.  Medical office building.
MOB
 
.  Physician group practice clinics, healthcare laboratory and laboratory research facilities, and health and wellness centers.
"Other" Property Type
.  An important component of the Company's evaluation of the operating performance of its properties.  The Company defines its same property portfolio each quarter as those properties that have been in operation throughout the current year and the prior year and that were also in operation at January 1st of the prior year.  Newly acquired assets, developments in process and assets held for sale are excluded from the same property portfolio.  Accordingly, when a property is disposed of to a third party, it will be removed from the same property portfolio for the current and prior year reporting periods, but previously presented quarterly information will not be changed.  Same property statistics allow management to evaluate the NOI of its real estate portfolio as a consistent population from period to period and eliminates the effects of changes in the composition of the properties on performance measures.
Same Property Performance ("SPP")
 
.  Mortgage debt secured by real estate.
Secured Debt
 
.  The square footage for properties either owned directly by the Company or which the Company has a controlling interest (e.g., consolidated joint ventures) and excludes square footage for development properties prior to completion.
Square Feet Owned
 
.  The carrying amount of consolidated debt plus the carrying amount of stockholders' equity.
Total Book Capitalization
 
.  Consolidated debt at Book Value plus total Market Equity.
Total Market Capitalization
 
.  The carrying amount of the Company's real estate assets, including intangibles, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Undepreciated Book Value
 
 
.  Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends.  The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred shareholders for purposes of presenting Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage. However, the usefulness of Adjusted Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
Adjusted Fixed Charges
 
.  EBITDA divided by Adjusted Fixed Charges.  The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred shareholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  However, since this ratio is derived from EBITDA and Adjusted Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted Fixed Charges.  Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage
 
The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity.  The Company's presentation of EBITDA herein is solely as a non-GAAP liquidity measure in connection with the presentation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.  As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA helps investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company. The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA in conjunction with cash flow from operating activities, and other required measures under GAAP, to improve their understanding of the Company's liquidity.  EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations.  EBITDA does not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  Also, EBITDA does not reflect the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the Company's outstanding debt.  The Company believes cash flow from operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA.  EBITDA does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

.  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful.  The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.

.  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common shareholders.
FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share
 
.  A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and same property performance, or "SPP."  The Company defines NOI from continuing operations as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property level operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.  The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis, independent of related secured debt. NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, amortization of other lease intangibles and lease termination fees.  The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP.  The company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.  NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items.  Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
