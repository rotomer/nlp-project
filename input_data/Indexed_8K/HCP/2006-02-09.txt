In addition, the Compensation Committee approved annual incentive bonuses for the 2005 fiscal year for the Company's named executive officers, based upon multiple performance criteria, including subjective evaluations of personal job performance and performance measured against objective business criteria.  The 2005 annual cash incentive bonus amounts for the Company's named executive officers are as follows:  James F.

The Restricted Stock Units are subject in whole or in part to forfeiture in the event the Company does not reach specified targets for funds from operations per share during fiscal 2006.  Those Restricted Stock Units that are not forfeited vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment by Mr. Flaherty through that date and subject to accelerated vesting in connection with certain terminations of employment in accordance with Mr. Flaherty's employment agreement with the Company.
