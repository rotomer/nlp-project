On February 17, 2006, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and UBS Securities LLC (the "Distribution Agreement"), pursuant to which we appointed each of them as our agent for the purpose of soliciting and receiving offers to purchase the medium-term notes. In addition, any agent may also purchase medium-term notes as principal pursuant to a terms agreement relating to the applicable sale.
 
The medium-term notes are issuable pursuant to an Indenture dated as of September 1, 1993, by and between us and The Bank of New York (the "Indenture"). In connection with the commencement of our medium-term note program and pursuant to the Indenture, we delivered an Officers' Certificate dated February 17, 2006 (the "Officers' Certificate") to The Bank of New York setting forth the terms of the medium-term notes.

Exhibit 1.1
 
February 17, 2006
 
Banc of America Securities LLC Barclays Capital Inc. UBS Securities LLC
 
Dear Sirs:
 
Health Care Property Investors, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and UBS Securities LLC (each an "Agent" and, collectively, the "Agents") with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of its Medium-Term Notes described herein (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture", which term as used herein includes any instrument establishing the form and terms of the Notes) dated as of September 1, 1993 between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee").
 
As of the date hereof, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of up to $400,000,000 aggregate initial offering price of Notes to or through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of additional Notes and that such additional Notes may be sold to or distributed through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date hereof.
 
This Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company to one or more of the Agents as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers and for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to investors (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and the applicable Agent) in which case the applicable Agent will act as agent of the Company in soliciting Note purchases.
 
On December 15, 2003, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-111174) for the registration of $1,500,000,000 aggregate offering price of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, and debt securities, including the Notes, under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (such rules and regulations, the "1933 Act Regulations") and the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto as may be required prior to acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes. Such registration statement (as so amended, if applicable) has been declared effective by the Commission and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). Such registration statement (and any further registration statements which may be filed by the Company for the purpose of registering additional Notes and in connection with which this Agreement is included or incorporated by reference as an exhibit) and the prospectus constituting a part thereof, and any prospectus supplements relating to the Notes, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time amended or supplemented pursuant to the 1933 Act by the filing of documents pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), the 1933 Act or otherwise, and the documents otherwise deemed to be part thereof or included therein by the 1933 Act Regulations, are referred to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus", respectively, except that if any revised prospectus and/or prospectus supplement relating to the Notes shall be provided to the Agents by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Notes, whether or not such revised prospectus and/or prospectus supplement relating to the Notes is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus and/or prospectus supplement relating to the Notes from and after the time it is first provided to the Agents for such use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement any prospectus supplement prepared with respect to the offering of a series of debt securities other than the Notes shall not be deemed to have supplemented the Prospectus.
 
SECTION 1.
Appointment as Agent.
 
(a)
                                 
Appointment
. Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to appoint additional persons as "Agents" hereunder at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company (provided that each such additional person agrees to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement (including Schedule A)), the Company hereby agrees that Notes will be sold to or through the Agents. Each Agent is authorized to engage the services of any other broker or dealer in connection with the offer or sale of the Notes purchased by such Agent as principal for resale to others but is not authorized to appoint sub-agents. In connection with sales by the Agents of Notes purchased by the Agents as principal to other brokers or dealers, the Agents may allot any portion of the discount they have received in connection with such purchase from the Company to such brokers or dealers.
 
(b)
                                
Sale of Notes
. The Company shall not sell or approve the solicitation of purchases of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized by the Company from time to time or in excess of the principal amount of Notes registered pursuant to the Registration Statement. The Agents will have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold, or of otherwise monitoring the availability of Notes for sale, under the Registration Statement.
 
(c)
                                 
Purchases as Principal
. No Agent shall have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, but each Agent may agree from time to time to purchase Notes
as principal. Any such purchase of Notes by an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof.
 
(d)
                                
Solicitations as Agent
. If agreed upon by an Agent and the Company, such Agent acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal will solicit purchases of the Notes. Such Agent will communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each reasonable offer to purchase Notes solicited by such Agent on an agency basis, other than those offers rejected by such Agent. Such Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of Notes, as a whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of such Agent's agreement contained herein. The Company may accept or reject any proposed purchase of the Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of the Company's agreement contained herein. Such Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company. Such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such agency purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold such Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to such Agent any commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale.
 
(e)
                                 
Reliance
. The Company and the Agents agree that any Notes purchased by an Agent shall be purchased, and any Notes the placement of which an Agent arranges shall be placed by such Agent, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.

SECTION 9.
Contribution.
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discount or commissions received by each applicable Agent, as the case may be, bears to the aggregate initial offering price of such Notes.
 
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the applicable Agent(s) and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the applicable Agent(s) agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, (i) no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount or commission received by such Agent in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any applicable untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In addition, in connection with an offering of Notes purchased from the Company by two or more Agents as principal, the respective obligations of such Agents to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Notes that each such Agent has agreed to purchase from the Company.
 
For purposes of this Section 9, each person, if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter. With your consent, we have relied upon the foregoing and upon certificates and other assurances of officers of the Company and others as to factual matters without having independently verified such factual matters.
We are opining herein as to the internal laws of the State of California, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state. We understand that certain matters concerning the laws of the State of Maryland are addressed in an opinion of Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll, LLP separately provided to you, and we express no opinion with respect to those matters.
 
Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, when the Notes have been duly executed, issued, authenticated and delivered by or on behalf of the Company against delivery and payment therefor in accordance with the Indenture and the Officers' Certificate and in the circumstances contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, the Notes will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with their terms.
 
The opinion rendered in the foregoing paragraph relating to the enforceability of the Notes is subject to the following exceptions, limitations and qualifications: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, preference, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought; (iii) the unenforceability under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; (iv) restrictions upon non-written modifications and waivers; and (v) we express no opinion concerning the enforceability of: (a) any provision requiring the payment of attorneys' fees, where such payment is contrary to law or public policy; or (b) any provision permitting, upon acceleration of the Notes, collection of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon.
 
With your consent, we have assumed that (i) the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Maryland, and has the corporate power and authority to enter into and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement, the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes (collectively, the ""); (ii) the Notes have been duly authorized for issuance by all necessary corporate action by the Company and the execution, delivery and performance of the Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action by the Company; (iii) the Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by parties thereto, including the Company; (iv) the Documents constitute legally valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto other than the Company, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms; and (v)  the status of the Documents as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto is not affected by any (a) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (b) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (c) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities.
