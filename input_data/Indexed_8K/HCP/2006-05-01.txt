NEWS RELEASE
 
HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC. REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2006
 
LONG BEACH, CA, May 1, 2006  Health Care Property Investors, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:HCP), a healthcare real estate investment trust ("REIT"), today announced operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, was $52.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share of common stock. This compares with net income applicable to common shares of $38.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended March 31, 2005.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares was $73.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, compared to FFO applicable to common shares of $58.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. The Company's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, include income of $7.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share of common stock, resulting from a prepayment premium the Company received upon the early repayment of a secured loan receivable. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is helpful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: The statements contained in this release which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements, which include statements regarding expected yields on properties, are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include competition for the acquisition and financing of healthcare facilities; competition for lessees and mortgagors (including new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases); continuing operational difficulties in the skilled nursing and assisted living sectors; the Company's ability to acquire, sell or lease facilities and the timing of acquisitions, sales and leasings; changes in healthcare laws and regulations and other changes in the healthcare industry which affect the operations of the Company's lessees or mortgagors; changes in management; costs of compliance with building regulations; changes in tax laws and regulations; changes in the financial position of the Company's lessees and mortgagors; changes in rules governing financial reporting, including new accounting pronouncements; and changes in economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital, which affect opportunities for profitable investments. Some of these risks, and other risks, are described from time to time in Health Care Property Investors, Inc.'s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
 
The Company believes that Funds From Operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares, Diluted Funds From Operations applicable to common shares and Basic and Diluted Funds From Operations per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
(1)
  
 
FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. A reconciliation of net income applicable to common shares to FFO applicable to common shares is provided herein.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
Health Care Property Investors, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures (collectively, "HCP" or the "Company"), invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. Health Care Property Investors, Inc. is a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT") organized in 1985. The Company is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with operations in Nashville, Tennessee, and its portfolio includes interests in 534 properties in 42 states. The Company acquires healthcare facilities and leases them to healthcare providers and provides mortgage financing secured by healthcare facilities. The Company's portfolio includes: (i) senior housing, including independent living facilities ("ILFs"), assisted living facilities ("ALFs"), and continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs"); (ii) medical office buildings ("MOBs"); (iii) hospitals; (iv) skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"); and (v) other healthcare facilities, including laboratory and office buildings. For business segment financial data, see our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 
References herein to "HCP," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" include Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, unless the context otherwise requires.
 
The Company is organized to invest in income-producing healthcare related facilities. Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles  opportunistic investing, portfolio diversification and conservative financing.
 
  We make real estate investments that are expected to drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value. We attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations where we believe the opportunities meet our goals and investment criteria. We invest in properties directly and through joint ventures, and provide secured financing, depending on the nature of the investment opportunity.
Opportunistic Investing.
 
    We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare-related real estate diversified by sector, geography, operator and investment product. Diversification within the healthcare industry reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business. This allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics. While pursuing our strategy of maintaining diversification in our portfolio, there are no specific limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property, property type, geographic location or in the number of properties which we may invest, lease or lend to a single operator. With investments in multiple sectors of healthcare real estate, HCP can focus on opportunities with the best risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole, rather than having to choose from transactions within a specific property type.
Portfolio Diversification.
 
   We believe a conservative balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach and portfolio diversification principles. We maintain our conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining available sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of credit. Our debt is primarily fixed rate, which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations. Generally, we attempt to match the long-term duration of our leases with long-term fixed rate financing.
Conservative Financing.
 
In underwriting our investments, we structure and adjust the price of the investment in accordance with our assessment of risk. We may structure transactions as master leases, require indemnifications, obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or security deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk. We finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit or arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for longer-term financing through public offerings or from institutional investors. We may incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred or common stock.
 
We may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we acquire. We may also obtain non-recourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance existing debt on properties acquired.
 
As of March 31, 2006 the Company's portfolio of properties, excluding assets held for sale but including investments through joint ventures and mortgage loans, included 534 properties in 42 states and consisted of:
 
29 hospitals

. Assisted living facility.
ALF
 
. The most recent monthly interest and principal amortization due to HCP as of period end annualized for twelve months. The Company uses Annualized Debt Service for purposes of determining Debt Service Coverage.
Annualized Debt Service
 
The annualized future minimum rents due to HCP in the year of lease expiration.
Annualized Expiring Rent.
 
. The most recent monthly base rent due to HCP as of period end annualized for twelve months plus additional rents received by HCP over the most recent twelve month period as of period end. The Company uses Annualized Rent for purposes of determining property level Cash Flow Coverage.
Annualized Rent
 
. Assets of discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, .
Assets Held for Sale
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
. Hospitals and skilled nursing facilities are measured by licensed bed count. ALFs and CCRCs are stated in units (e.g., studio, one or two bedroom units). MOBs and other healthcare facilities are measured in square feet.
Beds/Units/Square Feet
 
. The carrying amount as reported in the Company's financial statements.
Book Value
 
. Facility level EBITDAR of the property's operator (not the Company) for the most recent twelve months of available data divided by the Annualized Rent. Cash Flow Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate cash flow to meet related rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR. The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. Results exclude data related to hospitals leased to HealthSouth until HealthSouth provides assurance about its financial information. Results also exclude data related to ALFs leased to Emeritus since the operator has elected not to allocate the cost of a recent liability judgment to each of the facilities until the ultimate outcome of that judgment is clear.
Cash Flow Coverage
 
. Continuing care retirement community.
CCRC
 
. The periodic payment of interest expense and principal amortization on secured loans.
Debt Service
 
. Facility level EBITDAR of the property's operator (not the Company) for the most recent twelve months of available data divided by the Annualized Debt Service. Debt Service Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet related obligations to the Company under loan agreements. However, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR. The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. Results exclude data related to one ALF that secures a loan to Emeritus since the operator has elected not to allocate the cost of a recent liability judgment to this facility until the ultimate outcome of that judgment is clear.
Debt Service Coverage
 
. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for a particular facility accruing to the operator of the property (not the Company). The Company uses Facility EBITDAR in determining Debt Service Coverage and Cash Flow Coverage. EBITDAR as an analytical tool has limitations similar to EBITDA. However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's management. The Company utilizes Facility EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company. Facility EBITDAR includes an imputed management fee of 2% for acute care hospitals and 5% for skilled nursing facilities, ALFs and CCRCs which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries. All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by lessees and borrowers without verification by the Company.
Facility EBITDAR
 
. For MOBs and other healthcare properties, facility occupancy represents the percentage of rentable square feet occupied. For hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ALFs and CCRCs, facility occupancy represents the facilities' operating occupancy for each quarter based on the most recent quarter of available data. The percentages are calculated based on licensed beds, available beds and units for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ALFs and CCRCs, respectively. The percentages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. All facility financial performance data were derived solely from information provided by lessees and borrowers.
Facility Occupancy
 
. Future minimum lease payments to be received by HCP, excluding operating expense reimbursements, from lessees under non-cancelable operating leases as of period end.
Future Minimum Rents
 
. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
GAAP
 
. HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture formed between the Company and an affiliate of General Electric Company ("GE"), for which the Company is managing member and has a 33% interest therein.
HCP MOP
 
The carrying amount of real estate assets, including intangibles, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization and the carrying amount of mortgage loans receivable. Excludes assets held for sale and classified as discontinued operations.
Investment.
 
. The total number of outstanding shares of the Company's common stock multiplied by the closing price per share of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end plus the total number of convertible partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end (adjusted for stock splits) plus the total number of outstanding shares of the Company's preferred stock multiplied by the closing price of its preferred stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end.
Market Equity
 
. Medical office building.
MOB
 
. Physician group practice clinics, healthcare laboratory and laboratory research facilities, and health and wellness centers.
"Other" Property Type
. An important component of the Company's evaluation of the operating performance of its properties. The Company defines its same property portfolio each quarter as those properties that have been in operation throughout the current year and the prior year and that were also in operation at January 1st of the prior year. Newly acquired assets, developments in process and assets classified in discontinued operations are excluded from the same property portfolio. Same property statistics allow management to evaluate the NOI of its real estate portfolio as a consistent population from period to period and eliminates the effects of changes in the composition of the properties on performance measures.
Same Property Performance ("SPP")
 
. Mortgage debt secured by real estate.
Secured Debt
 
. The square footage for properties either owned directly by the Company or which the Company has a controlling interest (e.g., consolidated joint ventures) and excludes square footage for development properties prior to completion.
Square Feet Owned
 
. The carrying amount of consolidated debt plus the carrying amount of stockholders' equity.
Total Book Capitalization
 
. Consolidated debt at Book Value plus total Market Equity.
Total Market Capitalization
 
The carrying amount of the Company's real estate assets, including intangibles, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization plus net loans receivable plus investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures.
Undepreciated investments.
. Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends. The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred shareholders for purposes of presenting Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage. However, the usefulness of Adjusted Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations. The Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
Adjusted Fixed Charges
 
. EBITDA divided by Adjusted Fixed Charges. The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred shareholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company. However, since this ratio is derived from EBITDA and Adjusted Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted Fixed Charges. Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage
 
The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity. The Company's presentation of EBITDA herein is solely as a non-GAAP liquidity measure in connection with the presentation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage. As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA helps investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company. The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA in conjunction with cash flow from operating activities, and other required measures under GAAP, to improve their understanding of the Company's liquidity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations. EBITDA does not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. Also, EBITDA does not reflect the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the Company's outstanding debt. The Company believes cash flow from operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA. EBITDA does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

. The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
Funds From Operations ("FFO")
 
. Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period. The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common shareholders.
FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share
. A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and same property performance, or "SPP."  The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property level operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, interest expense and discontinued operations. The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis. NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, amortization of other lease intangibles and lease termination fees. The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP. The company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
