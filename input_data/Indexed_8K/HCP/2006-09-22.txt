ANNUAL MEETINGS  Annual meetings of stockholders for the election of directors to succeed directors whose terms are expiring and the transaction of any business within the powers of the Corporation, shall be held on a date and at a time between April 15 and May 15, inclusive, as designated by the Board of Directors at such place, within or without the State of Maryland, as the Board of Directors by resolution shall determine, and as set forth in the notice of the meeting.
SECTION 2.           SPECIAL MEETINGS  Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or a majority of the Board of Directors, and shall be called by the Secretary or any other officer upon written request of stockholders holding in the aggregate not less than 50% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the business proposed to be transacted thereat.

Unless requested by stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at a meeting of stockholders, a special meeting need not be called to consider any matter which is substantially the same as a matter voted on at any special meeting of the

VOTING  At each annual meeting the stockholders entitled to vote shall elect directors to succeed the directors whose terms are expiring, and the stockholders may transact such other corporate business as may be within the powers of the Corporation., subject to Section 7 of this Article II.  The vote for directors, and, upon the demand of any stockholder entitled to vote on any such matter, the vote upon any question before the meeting, shall be by ballot.  All elections of directors shall be by a plurality of the votes cast, and all questions shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast, except as otherwise provided by the Charter of the Corporation or by the laws of the State of Maryland.
The directors may fix a day not more than ninety (90) days nor less than ten (10) days prior to the holding of any meeting of stockholders as the date as of which stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting shall be determined; and only stockholders of record on such day shall be entitled to notice of or to vote at any such meeting.

SECTION 6.           ACTION WITHOUT MEETING  Any action to be taken by the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, if, prior to such action, all stockholders entitled to vote thereon shall consent in writing to such action being taken, and such consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote at a meeting.

To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or delayed by more than sixty (60) days from such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.

In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 7 (together with the information and consents required pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (a)(2)) shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

The presiding officer of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 7, to declare that such defective nomination or proposal be disregarded.

STOCK CERTIFICATES AND UNCERTIFICATED SHARES    The shares of stock in the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the Corporation's stock shall be uncertificated shares.  Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate theretofore issued until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation.  Every holder of shares of stock of the Corporation, other than uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to a certificate or certificates signed by the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President, and countersigned by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, representing and certifying to the number of shares of stock owned by such holder.  The signatures on certificates of stock may be either manual or facsimile.

In case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer at the date of its issue.  Each certificate representing shares of the capital stock of the Corporation shall bear on its face or back such statements relating to the authority of the Corporation to issue more than one class of stock, the designations and other terms and conditions of each such class of stock and restrictions on transferability of capital stock imposed by the Corporation, or a statement that such information will be provided on request and without charge, all as and to the extent which may be required by the laws of the State of Maryland.

It may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed, or otherwise reproduced.

In lieu of the stock ledger or duplicate stock ledger, a statement may be filed in the principal office stating the name of the custodian of the stock ledger or duplicate stock ledger, and the present and complete post office address (including street and number, if any) where such stock ledger or duplicate stock ledger is kept.
The Board of Directors shall take all reasonable steps to assure that a full and correct annual statement of the affairs of the Corporation is prepared annually, including a balance sheet and a financial statement of operations for the preceding fiscal year which shall be certified by independent certified public accountants, and distributed to stockholders within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the close of the Corporation's fiscal year and a reasonable period of time prior to the annual meeting of stockholders.  Such annual statement shall also be submitted at the annual meeting and shall be filed within twenty (20) days thereafter at the principal office of the Corporation in the State of Maryland.  The Board of Directors shall also be responsible for scheduling the annual meeting of stockholders.
SECTION 5.
