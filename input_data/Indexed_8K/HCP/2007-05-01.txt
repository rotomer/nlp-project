FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HEALTH CARE PROPERTY INVESTORS, INC. REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2007
LONG BEACH, CA, April 30, 2007 -- Health Care Property Investors, Inc. (the "Company" or "We") (NYSE:HCP), today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Funds From Operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares was $102.4 million, or $0.50 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, compared to FFO applicable to common shares of $73.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
FFO applicable to common shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 included the impact of merger-related charges of $0.03 per diluted share of common stock and write-offs of costs related to acquisitions not consummated of $0.01 per diluted share of common stock.  No merger-related charges or write-offs of acquisition costs were incurred in the year ago period.  Merger-related charges in the 2007 period include the amortization of fees associated with our CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. ("CRP") merger financing, severance and retention related compensation, as well as other CRP integration costs. FFO applicable to common shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, includes income of $7.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share of common stock, resulting from a prepayment premium the Company received upon the early repayment of a secured loan receivable. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is helpful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts.
Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, was $140.0 million, or $0.68 per diluted share of common stock. This compares with net income applicable to common shares of $52.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. The Company's net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes a net gain on sales of real estate of $104.0 million. During the quarter ended March 31, 2007, the Company sold 27 properties for net proceeds of $170.1 million.
INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
                  
During the three months ended March 31, 2007, we acquired interests in properties aggregating $449 million with an average yield of 8.2%.

On January 31, 2007, we acquired three long-term acute care hospitals and received proceeds of $36 million in exchange for 11 Skilled Nursing Facilities ("SNFs") valued at $77 million. We recognized a $47 million gain on the sale of these 11 SNFs.  The three acquired properties have an initial lease term of ten years, with two ten-year renewal options, and an initial contractual yield
1
of 12% with escalators based on the lessee's revenue growth.  The acquired properties are included in a new master lease that contains 14 properties leased to the same operator.
                 
On February 9, 2007, we acquired the Medical City Dallas campus, which includes two hospital towers, six medical office buildings, and three parking garages, for approximately $350 million, including non-managing member LLC units ("DownREIT units") valued at $179 million. The initial yield on this campus is approximately 7.2%.
                 
On February 28, 2007, we acquired three medical office buildings for $25 million from the Cirrus Group, LLC ("Cirrus"). The three medical office buildings include approximately 131,000 rentable square feet and have an initial yield of 8.2%.
                  
During the three months ended March 31, 2007, we sold 27 properties for proceeds of $170 million and recognized gains of approximately $104 million. Our 2007 dispositions were made in the following healthcare sectors: (i) 63% SNFs, (ii) 23% senior housing facilities and (iii) 14% other healthcare facilities. These sales included nine SNFs sold for $52 million with gains of approximately $30 million. During the fourth quarter of 2006, tenants for these nine SNFs exercised rights of first refusal to acquire such facilities.
JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTIONS
                 
On January 5, 2007, we formed a senior housing joint venture with an institutional capital partner.  The joint venture includes 25 properties valued at $1.1 billion and encumbered by a $686 million secured debt facility. Upon formation, we received approximately $280 million in proceeds, including a one-time acquisition fee of $5.4 million.  We retained a 35% interest in the venture, will act as the managing member, and will receive ongoing asset management fees.
                 
On April 30, 2007, we formed a medical office building joint venture with an institutional capital partner.

Upon formation, we received approximately $196 million in proceeds, which included a one-time acquisition fee of $3 million.  Including the $122 million of recently placed secured debt discussed below, we received $318 million in total proceeds.

We received net proceeds of $493 million, which were used to fully repay our term loan facility and reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
                 
On April 27, 2007, in anticipation of our joint venture that closed on April 30, 2007, $122 million of 10-year term mortgage notes were placed with an interest rate of 5.53%. The proceeds from the placement of these notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.
                 
OTHER EVENTS
                 
On April 25, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.445 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on May 18, 2007, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 7, 2007.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: The statements contained in this release which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include the Company's estimate of net income per diluted common share, FFO per diluted common share, and FFO per diluted common share before giving effect to merger-related charges for 2007.  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include the ability of the Company to achieve its expected benefits from acquisitions; competition for lessees and mortgagors (including new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases); continuing operational difficulties in the skilled nursing and senior housing sectors; the Company's ability to acquire, sell or lease facilities and the timing of acquisitions, sales and leasings; changes in healthcare laws and regulations and other changes in the healthcare industry which affect the operations of the Company's lessees or mortgagors; changes in management; costs of compliance with building regulations; changes in tax laws and regulations; changes in the financial position of the Company's lessees and mortgagors; changes in rules governing financial reporting, including new accounting pronouncements; and changes in economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital, which affect opportunities for profitable investments. Some of these risks, and other risks, are described from time to time in Health Care Property Investors, Inc.'s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

The Company believes that Funds From Operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares, Diluted Funds From Operations applicable to common shares and Basic and Diluted Funds From Operations per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
(1)
         
FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income.  A reconciliation of net income applicable to common shares to FFO applicable to common shares is provided herein.

PROJECTED FUTURE OPERATIONS (Full Year 2007):
 
(1)
         
Except as otherwise noted above, the foregoing projections reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release. These estimates also include the impact on operating results from potential future property acquisitions and dispositions, but do not reflect the potential impact of future impairments, if any.  By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization or gains and losses associated with real estate disposition activities, but does include impairment charges. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. The aforementioned ranges represent management's best estimate of results based upon the underlying assumptions as of the date of this press release.

About the Company
Health Care Property Investors, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures (collectively, "HCP" or the "Company"), invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States.  Health Care Property Investors, Inc. is a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT") organized in 1985.  The Company is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with operations in Nashville, Tennessee and Orlando, Florida, and its portfolio includes interests in 730 properties.  The Company acquires healthcare facilities and leases them to healthcare providers and provides mortgage financing secured by healthcare facilities. The Company's portfolio includes: (i) senior housing, including independent living facilities ("ILFs"), assisted living facilities ("ALFs"), and continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs"); (ii) medical office buildings ("MOBs"); (iii) hospitals; (iv) skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"); and (v) other healthcare facilities, including laboratory and office buildings. For business segment financial data, see our consolidated information included elsewhere in this report.
References herein to "HCP," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" include Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, unless the context otherwise requires.
The Company is organized to invest in healthcare-related facilities.  Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth.  Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles  opportunistic investing, portfolio diversification and conservative financing.
  We make real estate investments that are expected to drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value. We attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations where we believe the opportunities meet our goals and investment criteria. We invest in properties directly and through joint ventures, and provide secured financing, depending on the nature of the investment opportunity.
Opportunistic Investing
.
  We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare-related real estate diversified by sector, geography, operator and investment product. Diversification within the healthcare industry reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business. This allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics. While pursuing our strategy of maintaining diversification in our portfolio, there are no specific limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property, property type, geographic location or in the number of properties which we may invest, lease or lend to a single operator.  With investments in multiple sectors of healthcare real estate, HCP can focus on opportunities with the best risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole, rather than having to choose from transactions within a specific property type.
Portfolio Diversification
.
  We believe a conservative balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach and portfolio diversification principles. We maintain our conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining available sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of credit. Our debt is primarily fixed rate, which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations. Generally, we attempt to match the long-term duration of our leases with long-term fixed-rate financing.
Conservative Financing
.
In underwriting our investments, we structure and adjust the price of the investment in accordance with our assessment of risk. We may structure transactions as master leases, require indemnifications, obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or security deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk. We finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit or arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for longer-term financing through public offerings or from institutional investors. We may incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred or common stock. We may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we acquire. We may also obtain non-recourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance existing debt on properties acquired.
As of March 31, 2007, the Company's portfolio of properties, excluding assets held for sale and classified as discontinued operations, included 730 properties and consisted of:
331 senior housing facilities
                 
264 medical office buildings
                 
39 hospitals
                 
67 skilled nursing facilities
                 
29 other healthcare facilities

Beds/Units/Square Feet
.  The carrying amount as reported in the Company's financial statements.
Book Value
.  Facility level EBITDAR of the property's operator (not the Company) for the most recent twelve months of available data divided by the Annualized Rent.  Cash Flow Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate cash flow to meet related rent and other obligations to the Company.  However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR.  The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.  Results exclude data related to hospitals leased to HealthSouth until HealthSouth provides assurance about its financial information.   Results also exclude data related to ALFs leased to Emeritus since the operator has elected not to allocate the cost of a recent liability judgment to each of the facilities.

. Facility level EBITDAR of the property's operator (not the Company) for the most recent twelve months of available data divided by the Annualized Debt Service. Debt Service Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet related obligations to the Company under loan agreements.  However, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR.  The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. Results exclude data related to one ALF that secures a loan to Emeritus since the operator has elected not to allocate the cost of a recent liability judgment.
Debt Service Coverage
Direct financing lease.
DFL. 
.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for a particular facility accruing to the operator of the property (not the Company). The Company uses Facility EBITDAR in determining Debt Service Coverage and Cash Flow Coverage.  EBITDAR as an analytical tool has limitations similar to EBITDA.  However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's management.  The Company utilizes Facility EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.  Facility EBITDAR includes the greater of (i) contractual management fees or (ii) an imputed management fee of 2% for acute care hospitals and 5% for skilled nursing facilities, ILFs, ALFs and CCRCs which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries.  All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by lessees and borrowers without verification by the Company.
Facility EBITDAR
.  For MOBs and other healthcare properties, facility occupancy represents the percentage of rentable square feet occupied. For hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ALFs and CCRCs, facility occupancy represents the facilities' operating occupancy for each quarter based on the most recent quarter of available data.  The percentages are calculated based on licensed beds, available beds and units for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ILFs, ALFs and CCRCs, respectively.  The percentages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.  All facility financial performance data

  Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges.  The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred shareholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges.  Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.
The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding minority interests' share of earnings and gains or losses from real estate dispositions.  The Company's presentations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA herein are solely as non-GAAP liquidity measures in connection with the presentation of Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.  As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments.  The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with cash flow from operating activities, and other required measures under GAAP, to improve their understanding of the Company's liquidity.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  Also, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the Company's outstanding debt.  The Company believes cash flow from operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators.  Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
EBITDA. 
.  Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends.  The Company uses Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred shareholders for purposes of presenting Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.  However, the usefulness of Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
Fixed Charges

.  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful.  The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
Funds From Operations ("FFO")
43
.  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common shareholders.
FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share
.  A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and same property performance, or "SPP."  The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property level operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, interest expense and discontinued operations.  The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis.  NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees.  The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP.  The company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.  NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items.  Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI")
