HCP and SEGRO have made customary representations and warranties in the Share Purchase Agreement, which generally survive for 12 months after completion of the Share Purchase, with certain representations lasting for a longer period.  Each party has agreed to indemnify the other against breaches of the representations and warranties causing damages in excess of $25 million, up to a maximum of 4% of the net purchase price, with certain higher limits in respect of breaches of the representations and warranties concerning environmental matters.
HCP and SEGRO have also made customary covenants in the Share Purchase Agreement, including a covenant to use reasonable best efforts to complete the Share Purchase.  SEGRO has also agreed to:
conduct SEUSA's business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice until the Share Purchase is completed;
                 
not directly or indirectly solicit or engage in discussions concerning transactions which compete with the Share Purchase;
                 
not compete with HCP in the ownership, development or operation of life sciences properties in the United States for four years after completion of the Share Purchase, subject to limited exceptions; and
                 
not solicit or hire any of SEUSA's current executives for 10 years after completion of the Share Purchase.
                 
Each party's obligation to complete the Share Purchase is subject to several customary conditions, including approval of SEGRO's shareholders, the material accuracy of the other party's representations and warranties made in the Share Purchase Agreement and the material compliance of the other party with its covenants made in the Share Purchase Agreement.
The Share Purchase Agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of HCP and SEGRO, and the board of directors of SEGRO has recommended that SEGRO shareholders vote to approve the Share Purchase.
The Share Purchase Agreement can be terminated by HCP or SEGRO under certain circumstances.  Upon termination of the Share Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances described in the Share Purchase Agreement, SEGRO may be required to pay HCP or HCP may be required to pay SEGRO a termination fee of $65 million.  If the Share Purchase Agreement is terminated due to SEGRO's shareholders voting against the Share Purchase in the absence of a competing transaction or a breach of the non-solicitation covenants in the Share Purchase Agreement, SEGRO will be required to reimburse HCP for its transaction expenses up to $5 million.
The foregoing description of the Share Purchase and Share Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share Purchase Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  The Share Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about HCP, SEGRO or SEUSA. The Share Purchase Agreement contains representations and warranties that each of HCP and SEGRO have made to the other. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure letter that SEGRO has delivered in connection with signing the Share Purchase Agreement. The disclosure letter contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts at the time they were made or otherwise.
On June 3, 2007, HCP issued a press release in Long Beach, California announcing the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

SEUSA's portfolio is concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego County and comprises 83 existing properties representing approximately 5.2 million square feet of life science / pharma space.  Among these properties are some of the nation's largest corporate life science campuses, including the campuses for Genentech, Inc. and Amgen Inc. in South San Francisco.
In addition to the existing portfolio, SEUSA has an established development infrastructure with a proven track record and a pipeline currently comprised of 3.8 million square feet in the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego County.  The committed development pipeline represents over 500,000 square feet that is 86% preleased to investment grade tenants.  SEUSA also has a significant future development pipeline consisting of approximately 3.3 million square feet of space that will be developed in phases based on market demand.
SEUSA's management team, which averages fifteen years of life science development experience, is expected to continue to manage this portfolio after the acquisition under the leadership of Marshall D. Lees.  Lees will assume expanded responsibilities for management of HCP's existing life science portfolio as Executive Vice President of the newly constituted Life Science Group of HCP.
The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of HCP and SEGRO plc. The aggregate consideration is subject to adjustment based on SEUSA's net assets at closing. Cohen & Steers Capital Advisors, LLC served as financial advisor to HCP and provided a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction.  The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2007.
