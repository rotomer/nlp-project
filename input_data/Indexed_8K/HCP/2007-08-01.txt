Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On July 26, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Health Care Property Investors, Inc. (the "Company") approved a Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Plan") to provide greater consistency between the severance protections afforded certain eligible executives of the Company and to replace certain outstanding employment and change in control agreements with those executives.  The following summary of the CIC Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the CIC Plan, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 of the participant's base salary or average annual bonus for the preceding three years (based only on complete fiscal years in which the participant was employed); (2) a lump sum cash payment equal to the expected cost of COBRA premiums for medical coverage for 12 times the "severance multiplier"; (3) if not then fully-vested, full vesting in the participant's benefits under the Company's non-qualified pension, profit sharing or defined contribution plans plus a lump sum cash payment equal to the participant's then unvested benefits under the Company's 401(k) plan; (4) a lump sum cash payment of the participant's prorated annual bonus amount for the year of termination; (5) continued directors and officers' insurance coverage for six years following the termination date; and (6) full acceleration of vesting of any time-based vesting schedules applicable to the participant's equity awards (with twelve months to exercise options). (For these purposes, the terms "cause," "good reason" and "change in control" are each defined in the CIC Plan.)  In addition, participants will be entitled to a full gross-up for any excise taxes imposed under Section 280G and Section 4999 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") on the benefits payable to the participant in connection with the change in control if a "cut back" of those benefits by not more than $25,000 will not avoid the imputation of those taxes.  A participant's right to receive benefits under the CIC Plan is subject to the execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company upon the termination of the participant's employment.  Participants are subject to confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition restrictive covenants.
Under the CIC Plan, if, during the term of the CIC Plan, a change in control of the Company occurs and a participant's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause or by the participant for good reason within the two year period following the change in control, the participant will generally be entitled to receive the following benefits: (1) a cash lump sum payment equal to the participant's "severance multiplier" (as determined by the Compensation Committee) times the sum of (i) the participant's base salary plus (ii) the greater of 1/3
rd
The Compensation Committee also designated each of the Company's executive officers who was named in the Summary Compensation Table of the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, other than James F. Flaherty III, as a participant in the CIC Plan, subject to the executive's entry into a participation agreement with the Company terminating any existing change in control agreement between the Company and the executive that includes severance provisions.  Each named executive's severance multiplier under the CIC Plan is two times (2x).  Mr. Flaherty was not designated as a participant in the CIC Plan as his Employment Agreement with the Company entered into in October 2005 will continue in effect.

Exhibit 10.1
.  Health Care Property Investors, Inc. (the "") considers it essential to the best interests of its shareholders to foster the continuous employment of key management personnel.  In connection with this, the Corporation's Board of Directors (the "") recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a change in control of the Corporation may exist and that the uncertainty and questions that it may raise among management could result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Corporation and its shareholders.  The Board has decided to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of selected members of the Corporation's management to their assigned duties without the distraction arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Corporation.  In order to induce such members of management to remain in its employ, the Corporation hereby agrees that on and after the Effective Date (as defined in Section 2), subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, Participants (as defined in Section 3) shall be eligible to receive the severance benefits set forth in Section 6 of this Plan in the event that the Participants' employment with the Corporation is terminated under the circumstances described in Section 5 of this Plan subsequent to a Change in Control (as defined in Section 4).  Upon the Effective Date, any prior severance agreement or letter between each participant and the Corporation shall terminate and be of no further effect.

This Plan shall commence on the date of its approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "") and shall continue in effect through December 31, 2008 (the ""); provided, however, commencing on January 1, 2008 and on each January 1 thereafter, the Term shall automatically be extended for one additional year as to each Participant then in the Plan unless, not later than November 30 of the preceding year, the Corporation shall have given notice to the Participant that it does not wish to extend the Term, and if such notice is timely given, the Plan will terminate at the end of the Term then in effect as to each Participant who is timely given such notice (with no extension or further notice, as the case may be); provided, further, that if a Change in Control, occurs during the Term (or the extended Term, as the case may be), the Term shall continue in effect as to each Participant in the Plan at the time of the Change in Control for a period of not less than twenty-four (24) months beyond the month in which such Change in Control occurred.  For purposes of clarity, the Corporation may give notice of termination of the Term to all or only certain Participants. If such notice is given to only certain Participants, the Term shall continue as set forth above as to all other Participants (subject to the Corporation's rights to similarly terminate the Term in accordance with the foregoing on some future date(s) as to any such Participants).  A Participant shall cease to be eligible for benefits under this Plan (and shall cease to be a Participant) at midnight Pacific Time on the last day of the Term applicable to that Participant.  The termination or expiration of the Term as to a Participant shall not affect the Participant's obligations under Section 10 or affect the Participant's right to benefits (if any) pursuant to Section 6 as to any termination of employment that occurred during such Term.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, the Corporation's obligation to make any payment of benefits with respect to a Participant pursuant to Section 6(b) of this Plan (if the Participant is otherwise entitles to such benefits) is subject to the condition precedent that (i) the Participant has fully executed a valid and effective release (in the form attached hereto as or such other form as the Committee may reasonably require in the circumstances, which other form shall be substantially similar to that attached hereto as but with such changes as the Committee may determine to be required or reasonably advisable in order to make the release enforceable and otherwise compliant with applicable laws), (ii) such executed release is delivered by the Participant to the Corporation so that it is received by the Corporation in the time period specified below, and (iii) such release is not revoked by the Participant (pursuant to any revocation rights afforded by applicable law).  In order to satisfy the requirements of this Section 7(a), a Participant's release referred to in the preceding sentence must be delivered by the Participant to the Corporation so that it is received by the Corporation no later than twenty five (25) calendar days after the Participant's Date of Termination (or such later date as may be required for an enforceable release of the Participant's claims under the United States Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (""), to the extent the ADEA is applicable in the circumstances, in which case the Participant will be provided with either twenty one (21) or forty five (45) days, depending on the circumstances of the termination, to consider the release).  In addition, the Corporation may require that the Participant's release be executed no earlier than the date that the Participant's employment with the Corporation terminates.

Each Participant agrees that the general release agreement described in Section 7(a) will require that the Participant acknowledge, as a condition to the payment of any benefits under Section 6(b), that the payments contemplated by Section 6(b) shall constitute the exclusive and sole remedy for any termination of the Participant's employment, and each Participant will be required to covenant, as a condition to receiving any such payment, not to assert or pursue any other remedies, at law or in equity, with respect to any termination of employment.  No Participant shall be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in Section 6 by seeking other employment or otherwise nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in Section 6 be reduced by any compensation earned by the Participant as the result of employment by another employer or self-employment, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the Participant to the Corporation, or otherwise.

Successors; Assigns
The Corporation shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation to expressly assume and agree to perform the obligations under this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.  Failure of the Corporation to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be deemed a material breach of this Plan by the Corporation and shall entitle each Participant to terminate his or her employment and receive compensation from the Corporation in the same amount and on the same terms to which the Participant would be entitled hereunder if the Participant terminates his or her employment for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination.  Unless expressly provided otherwise, "Corporation" as used herein shall mean the Corporation as defined in this Plan and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid.
(a)
          
None of the benefits, payments, proceeds or claims of any Eligible Person or Participant shall be subject to any claim of any creditor and, in particular, the same shall not be subject to attachment or garnishment or other legal process by any creditor, nor shall any such Eligible Person or Participant have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber or assign any of the benefits or payments or proceeds which he or she may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, benefits which are in pay status may be subject to a court-ordered garnishment or wage assignment, or similar order, or a tax levy.  The Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Participant's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees.  If a Participant dies while any amount would still be payable to him or her hereunder had he or she continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid to the Participant's estate in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

.  Each Participant by accepting participation in the Plan expressly agrees to each of the foregoing provisions of this Section 10:
10.
          
Confidentiality, Noncompetition and Non-Solicitation Covenants
.  Each Participant shall not at any time (whether during or after the Participant's employment with the Corporation and whether or not the Participant subsequently ceases to participate in this Plan or is ever entitled to the benefits provided in Section 6) directly or indirectly, other than in the course of the Participant's duties hereunder, disclose or make available to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever, any Confidential Information (as defined below); provided, however, that this Section 10(a) shall not apply when (i) disclosure is required by law or by any court, arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including any committee thereof) with apparent jurisdiction to order the Participant to disclose or make available such information (provided, however, that the Participant shall promptly notify the Corporation in writing upon receiving a request for such information), or (ii) with respect to any other litigation, arbitration or mediation involving this Plan, including but not limited to enforcement of this Plan.  Upon termination of a Participant's employment with the Corporation, all Confidential Information in the Participant's possession that is in written, digital or other tangible form (together with all copies or duplicates thereof, including computer files) shall be returned to the Corporation and shall not be retained by the Participant or furnished to any third party, in any form except as provided herein; provided, however, that the Participant shall not be obligated to treat as confidential, or return to the Corporation copies of any Confidential Information that (x) was publicly known at the time it was disclosed to the Participant, (y) becomes publicly known or available thereafter other than by any means in violation of this Plan or any other duty owed to the Corporation by any person or entity, or (z) is lawfully disclosed to the Participant by a third party.  As used in this Plan, the term "" means: information disclosed to a Participant or known by a Participant as a consequence of or through the Participant's relationship with the Corporation, about the suppliers, customers, employees, business methods, public relations methods, organization, procedures or finances, including, without limitation, information of or relating to supplier lists or customer lists, of the Corporation and its affiliates (collectively, the "").

Thus, to avoid the inevitable disclosure of the Company Group's trade secrets and Confidential Information, and to protect such trade secrets and Confidential Information and the Company Group's relationships and goodwill with customers, during the Participant's employment with the Corporation and for a period of twelve (12) months after the Date of Termination for any reason (the ""), the Participant will not directly or indirectly engage in (whether as an employee, consultant, agent, proprietor, principal, partner, stockholder, corporate officer, director or otherwise), nor have any ownership interest in, or participate in the financing, operation, management or control of, any person, firm, corporation or business anywhere in the United States and Mexico (the "") that competes with any member of the

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event a Participant accepts employment with or provides services to a business (the "") that is affiliated with another business that engages in a Competing Business or which derives a de minimis portion of its gross revenues from Competing Businesses, the Participant's employment by or service to the Service Recipient shall not, in and of itself, constitute a breach by that Participant of his or her obligations pursuant to this Section 10(b) so long as each of the following conditions is satisfied at all times during the Restricted Period and while the Participant is employed by or providing service to the Service Recipient: (i) no more than 10% of the gross revenues of the Service Recipient are derived from Competing Businesses; (ii) no more than 10% of the gross revenues of the Service Recipient and those entities that (directly or through one or more intermediaries) are controlled by, control, or are under common control with such Service Recipient, together on a consolidated basis, are derived from Competing Businesses; and (iii) in the course of the Participant's services for the Service Recipient, a material portion of the Participant's services are not directly involved in or responsible for any Competing Business.  The foregoing covenants in this Section 10(b) shall continue in effect through the entire Restricted Period regardless of whether the Participant is then entitled to receive any severance payments from the Corporation.
Competing Business
Service Recipient
. During the Restricted Period, each Participant shall not to directly or indirectly solicit, induce, attempt to hire, recruit, encourage, take away, or hire any employee or independent contractor of the Company Group whose annual rate of compensation is then $50,000 or more or cause any such Company Group employee or contractor to leave his or her employment or engagement with the Company Group either for employment with the Participant or for any other entity or person.  The foregoing covenants in this Section 10(c) shall continue in effect through the entire Restricted Period regardless of whether the Participant is then entitled to receive any severance payments from the Corporation.
(c)
          
Non-Solicitation of Employees
.  During the Restricted Period, each Participant shall not to directly or indirectly influence or attempt to influence customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors, lessors, joint venturers, associates, consultants, agents, or partners of the Company Group to divert their business away from the Company Group to any Competing Business, and each Participant agrees not to otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business relationships, contractual or otherwise, between any member of the Company Group and any of its customers, suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, joint venturers, associates, officers, employees, consultants, managers, partners, members or investors.  The foregoing covenants in this Section 10(d) shall continue in effect through the entire Restricted Period regardless of whether the Participant is then entitled to receive any severance payments from the Corporation.

Non-Solicitation of Customers
Each Participant, by accepting participation in this Plan represents as follows: the Participant (i) is familiar with the foregoing covenants set forth in this Section 10, (ii) is fully aware of the Participant's obligations hereunder, (iii) agrees to the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage of the foregoing

covenants set forth in this Section 10, (iv) agrees that the Company Group currently conducts business throughout the Restricted Area, (v) agrees that such covenants are necessary to protect the Company Group's confidential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce, and customer relations, (vi) agrees that the Participant's coverage by this Plan for the Term applicable to the Participant is good, valid and sufficient consideration for (among other things) the Participant's agreement to such covenants, and (vii) agrees that such covenants shall continue in effect as to the Participant even if the Participant ceases at any time in the future to participate in the Plan (i.e., the Participant ceases to be a "Participant") and even if the Participant is never entitled to the benefits set forth in Section 6 (and accordingly, the term "Participant" includes a former "Participant" to the extent necessary to effect such covenants).
.  Each Participant's obligations not to disclose or use Confidential Information and to refrain from the solicitations described in this Section 10 are of a special and unique character, which gives them a peculiar value.  The Corporation cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages in an action at law in the event a Participant breaches such obligations, and the breach of such obligations would cause irreparable harm to the Corporation.  Therefore, the Corporation shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief without bond or other security in the event of such breach in addition to any other rights or remedies which the Corporation may possess.  Furthermore, each Participant's obligations and the rights and remedies of the Corporation under this Section 10 are cumulative and in addition to, and not in lieu of, any obligations, rights, or remedies created by applicable law relating to misappropriation or theft of trade secrets or confidential information.
(f)
           
Right to Injunctive and Equitable Relief
.  During each Participant's employment with the Corporation and thereafter, the Participant shall respond to all reasonable inquiries of the Corporation about any matters concerning the Corporation or its affairs that occurred or arose during the Participant's employment by the Corporation, and each Participant shall reasonably cooperate with the Corporation in investigating, prosecuting and defending any charges, claims, demands, liabilities, causes of action, lawsuits or other proceedings by, against or involving the Corporation relating to the period during which the Participant was employed by the Corporation or relating to matters of which the Participant had or should have had knowledge or information.  Further, except as required by law, each Participant will at no time voluntarily serve as a witness or offer written or oral testimony against the Corporation in conjunction with any complaints, charges or lawsuits brought against the Corporation by or on behalf of any current or former employees, or any governmental or administrative agencies related to the Participant's period of employment and will provide the Corporation with notice of any subpoena or other request for such information or testimony.

Arbitration; Dispute Resolution, Etc
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, the Participant, in his or her sole discretion, may elect to have any claim or controversy arising out of or in connection with the Plan and/or a Participation Agreement submitted to binding arbitration and adjudicated in accordance with this Section 12 without first having to exhaust the claims procedures set forth in Article 11.
(a)
          
  The Corporation and, by accepting participation in this Plan, each Participant hereby consent to the resolution by mandatory and binding arbitration of all claims or controversies arising out of or in connection with the Plan and/or the Participant's Participation Agreement that the Corporation may have against the Participant, or that the Participant may have against the Corporation or against any of its officers, directors, employees or agents acting in their capacity as such, and which are not resolved under the terms of Article 11 (or which are not required to be resolved under the terms of Article 11, as the case may be).  Each party's promise to resolve all such claims or controversies by arbitration in accordance with the Plan rather than through the courts is consideration for the other party's like promise.  It is further agreed that the decision of an arbitrator on any issue, dispute, claim or controversy submitted for arbitration, shall be final and binding upon the Corporation and the Participant and that judgment may be entered on the award of the arbitrator in any court having proper jurisdiction.
(b)
          
15
Except as otherwise provided in this procedure or by mutual agreement of the parties, any arbitration shall be before a sole arbitrator (the "") selected from Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc., Los Angeles, California, or its successor (""), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Civil Procedure Code Sections 1280 et. seq. as the exclusive remedy of such dispute.
(c)
          
Arbitrator
JAMS
The Arbitrator shall interpret the Plan, any applicable Corporation policy or rules and regulations, any applicable substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of the state in which the claim arose, or applicable federal law.  If arbitration is brought after the claim or controversy has been submitted for review by the Committee in accordance with Article 11, the Arbitrator shall limit his or her review to whether or not the Committee has abused its discretion in its interpretation of the Plan and such policies, rules, and regulations; provided, however, that the Arbitrator shall apply a de novo standard of review with respect to any claim for benefits hereunder in connection with a Change in Control.  In reaching his or her decision, the Arbitrator shall have no authority to change or modify any lawful Corporation policy, rule or regulation, or the Plan.  Except as provided in Section 12(e), the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive and broad authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Plan, including but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Plan is voidable.  The Arbitrator shall have the authority to decide dispositive motions.  Following completion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision disclosing the essential findings and conclusions upon which the award is based.
(d)
          
Notwithstanding the foregoing, provisional injunctive relief may, but need not, be sought by the Participant or the Corporation in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending, and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally resolved by the Arbitrator in accordance with the foregoing.  Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief which would otherwise be available at law and which the Arbitrator deems just and equitable.  The Arbitrator shall have the authority to award full damages as provided by law.  Any award or relief granted by the Arbitrator hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.
(e)
          
The Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Arbitrator and of a stenographic reporter, if employed.  Each party shall pay its own legal fees and other expenses and costs incurred with respect to the arbitration.

(vii)
        
.  Subject to Section 11, the Committee shall act with respect to the Plan at meetings by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Committee.

A member of the Committee shall not vote or act upon any matter which relates solely to himself or herself as a Participant.  The Chairman or any other member or members of the Committee designated by the Chairman may execute any certificate or other written direction on behalf of the Committee.

Any party may change its address for purposes of giving future notices pursuant to the Plan and any Participation Agreement by notifying the other party in writing of such change in address, such notice to be delivered or mailed in accordance with the foregoing.
.  The Plan and any Participation Agreement hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with ERISA and, to the extent not preempted thereby, the laws of the State of California (unless otherwise expressly provided in the Participant's Participation Agreement, in which case the law of the state specified in the Participant's Participation Agreement shall apply instead of the law of the State of California as to that Participant), without giving effect to any choice of law or conflicting provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than United States federal law and the law of the State of California (or other state, as applicable) to be applied.  In furtherance of the foregoing, applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by applicable federal law, the internal law of the State of California (or other state, as applicable), will control the interpretation and construction of the Plan and any Participation Agreement hereunder, even if under such jurisdiction's choice of law or conflict of law analysis, the substantive law of some other jurisdiction would ordinarily apply.  Any statutory reference in the Plan or any Participation Agreement shall also be deemed to refer to all applicable final rules and final regulations promulgated under or with respect to the referenced statutory provision.

Governing Law
.  The Committee may from time to time amend the Plan or any Participation Agreement in any way it deems to be advisable; provided that no such amendment shall materially and adversely affect the rights of any Participant (or former Participant) under the Plan or Participation Agreement, as applicable, without that Participant's (or former Participant's, as the case may be) consent.  Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of a party to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege under the Plan or any Participation Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise of the same or of any right,

remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any waiver of any right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to any occurrence be construed as a waiver of such right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to any other occurrence.  No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and is signed by the party asserted to have granted such waiver.  No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by the Corporation which are not expressly set forth in this Plan. All references to sections of the Exchange Act or the Code shall be deemed also to refer to any successor provisions to such sections.  The Corporation may withhold (or cause there to be withheld, as the case may be) from any amounts otherwise due or payable under or pursuant to this Plan such federal, state and local income, employment, or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.  Any obligations of the Corporation under Sections 4 and 6 shall survive the expiration of the term of this Agreement. The section headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience only, and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.
.  Participants and their heirs, successors, and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims, or interest in any specific property or assets of the Corporation or any Subsidiary.  No assets of the Corporation shall be held under any trust, or held in any way as collateral security, for the fulfilling of the obligations of the Corporation under this Plan.  Any and all of the Corporation's assets shall be, and remain, the general unpledged, unrestricted assets of the Corporation (unless pledged or restricted with respect to the Corporation's obligations other than the Plan).  The Corporation's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Corporation to pay money and benefits in the future, and the rights of the Participants and their heirs or successors as to benefits under the Plan shall be no greater than those of unsecured general creditors of the Corporation.

Unsecured General Creditor
.  All payments, benefits and amounts provided under the Plan shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any pension rights under the any tax-qualified pension or retirement plan in which the Participant participates, and any disability, workers' compensation or other Corporation benefit plan distribution that a Participant is entitled to (other than severance benefits), under the terms of any such plan, at the time the Participant ceases to be employed by the Corporation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan shall not create an inference that any duplicate payments shall be required.  Payments received by a person under the Plan shall not be deemed a part of the person's compensation for purposes of the determination of benefits under any other employee pension, welfare or other benefit plans or arrangements, if any, provided by the Corporation, except where explicitly provided under the terms of such plans or arrangements.

In the event any provision of the Plan or any Participation Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable under any present or future law, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of the Plan or Participation Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Furthermore, in lieu of such invalid or unenforceable provision there will be added automatically as a part of the Plan or Participation Agreement, as applicable, a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of the Plan or Participation Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Unless the Participant shall have given prior written notice to the Corporation to effectuate a reduction in the Payments if such a reduction is required, the Corporation shall reduce or eliminate the Payments by first reducing or eliminating any cash severance benefits, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of other equity-based awards, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining Payments.

Determination of Gross-Up
Except as provided in Section 3, the determination that a Payment is subject to an Excise Tax, and in such event, whether a Gross-Up Payment or a reduction in Payments is required pursuant to Section 1(a) and Section 1(b), shall be made in writing by a nationally recognized accounting firm or executive compensation consulting firm selected by the Corporation (the "").

Accounting Firm
For purposes of determining whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, and if so, the amount of any such Gross-Up Payment, the Participant shall be deemed to pay Federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of Federal individual income taxation in the calendar year in which the Payment is to be made.  Such highest marginal rate shall take into account the loss of itemized deductions by the Participant and shall also include the Participant's share of the hospital insurance portion of FICA and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of individual income taxation in the state and locality of the Participant's residence on the date that the Payment is made, net of the maximum reduction in Federal income taxes that could be obtained from the deduction of such state and local taxes.

Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than 30 days after the Participant receives written notice of such claim and shall apprise the Corporation of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid; provided, however, that if the Participant fails to give such notice within such 30-day period it shall not result in a waiver or forfeiture of any of the Participant's rights under this Exhibit C except to the extent of actual damages suffered by the Corporation as a result of such failure.  the Participant shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 15-day period following the date on which the Participant gives such notice to the Corporation (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes, interest, penalties or additions to tax with respect to such claim is due).  If the Corporation notifies the Participant in writing prior to the expiration of such 15-day period (regardless of whether such claim was earlier paid as contemplated by the preceding parenthetical) that it desires to contest such claim, the Participant shall:

provided, however, that the
Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 3, and to the extent its actions do not unreasonably interfere with or prejudice the Participant's disputes with the Taxing Authority as to other issues, the Corporation shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, in its reasonable discretion, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the Taxing Authority in respect of such claim and may, at its or in their sole option, either direct the Participant to pay the tax, interest or penalties claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Participant agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Corporation shall determine; provided, however, that if the Corporation directs the Participant to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Corporation shall advance an amount equal to such payment to the Participant, on an interest-free basis, and shall indemnify and hold the Participant harmless, on an after-tax basis, from all taxes (including, without limitation, income and excise taxes), interest, penalties and additions to tax imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance, as any such amounts are incurred; and, further, provided, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes, interest, penalties or additions to tax for the Participant's taxable year with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount; and, provided, further, that any settlement of any claim shall be reasonably acceptable to the Participant, and the Corporation's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Participant shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue.
(b)
          
C-3
If, after the Participant receives an amount advanced by the Corporation pursuant to Section 3(a), the Participant receives any refund with respect to such claim, the Participant shall (subject to the Corporation's compliance with the requirements of this Exhibit C) promptly pay to the Corporation an amount equal to such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereof after taxes applicable thereto), net of any taxes (including, without limitation, any income or excise taxes), interest, penalties or additions to tax and any other costs incurred by the Participant in connection with such advance, after giving effect to such repayment.
