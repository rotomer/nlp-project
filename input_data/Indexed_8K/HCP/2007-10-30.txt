FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
HCP REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2007
 
LONG BEACH, CA, October 29, 2007  HCP (the "Company" or "we") (NYSE:HCP) announced results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.  Funds From Operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares was $109.0 million, or $0.52 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, compared to FFO applicable to common shares of $69.4 million, or $0.50 per diluted share of common stock, in the year ago period.  FFO applicable to common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $331.9 million, or $1.60 per diluted share of common stock, compared to FFO applicable to common shares of $207.1 million, or $1.50 per diluted share of common stock, in the year ago period.
 
FFO applicable to common shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 includes the impact of merger-related charges of $0.05 and $0.08 per diluted share of common stock, respectively.  Merger-related charges in 2007 include the amortization and write-off of fees associated with our CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. ("CRP") and Slough Estates USA Inc. ("SEUSA") merger financing, severance and retention related compensation, as well as other CRP and SEUSA integration costs.

FFO applicable to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2007 includes income of $0.04 per diluted share of common stock, resulting from our change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight-line rental income from Summerville Senior Living, Inc., which was acquired by Emeritus Corporation.

In October 2007, we made aggregate payments of approximately $1.4 billion, reducing the outstanding principal balance of the bridge loan to $1.35 billion.

During the three months ended September 30, 2007, excluding the acquisition of SEUSA, we made investments of $118 million with an average yield of 7.8%.

JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION
On September 28, 2007, HCP Ventures IV, LLC, a joint venture formed on April 30, 2007, acquired an MOB valued at $35 million and concurrently placed $23 million of secured debt.  The acquisition was funded pro-rata by the partners to this joint venture.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: The statements contained in this release which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements include the Company's estimate of net income per diluted common share, FFO per diluted common share, and FFO per diluted common share before giving effect to merger-related charges for the full year of 2007.

The Company believes that Funds From Operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares, Diluted Funds From Operations applicable to common shares and Basic and Diluted Funds From Operations per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
 
FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from the Company. A reconciliation of net income applicable to common shares to FFO applicable to common shares is provided herein.

PROJECTED FUTURE OPERATIONS (Full Year 2007):
 
(1)
            
Except as otherwise noted above, the foregoing projections reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release. These estimates also include the impact on operating results from potential future property acquisitions and dispositions, but do not reflect the potential impact of future impairments, if any.  By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization or gains and losses associated with real estate disposition activities, but does include impairment charges. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. The aforementioned ranges represent management's best estimate of results based upon the underlying assumptions as of the date of this press release.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
HCP, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures (collectively, "HCP" or the "Company"), invests directly, or through joint ventures, in healthcare-related facilities located primarily throughout the United States.  HCP is a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT") organized in 1985.  The Company is headquartered in Long Beach, California, with operations in Nashville, Tennessee, Chicago, Illinois and San Francisco, California, and its portfolio includes interests in 753 properties.  The Company acquires healthcare-related facilities and leases them and provides mortgage financing. The Company's portfolio includes: (i) senior housing, including independent living facilities ("ILFs"), assisted living facilities ("ALFs"), and continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs"); (ii) medical office buildings ("MOBs"); (iii) life science facilities, including laboratory and office buildings; (iv) hospitals; (v) skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"); and (vi) other healthcare facilities, including physician group practice clinics and health and wellness centers. For business segment financial data, see our consolidated information included elsewhere in this report.
 
References herein to "HCP," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" include HCP, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures, unless the context otherwise requires.
 
The Company is organized to invest in healthcare-related facilities.  Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth.  Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles  opportunistic investing, portfolio diversification and conservative financing.
 
Opportunistic Investing
.
  We make real estate investments that are expected to drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value. We attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations where we believe the opportunities meet our goals and investment criteria. We invest in healthcare-related facilities directly and through joint ventures, and provide secured financing, depending on the nature of the investment opportunity.
 
Portfolio Diversification
.
  We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare-related real estate diversified by sector, geography, operator and investment product. Diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business. This allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics. While pursuing our strategy of maintaining diversification in our portfolio, there are no specific limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property, property type, geographic location or in the number of properties which we may invest, lease or lend to a single operator.  With investments in multiple sectors of healthcare real estate, HCP can focus on opportunities with the best risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole, rather than having to choose from transactions within a specific property type.
 
Conservative Financing
.
 We believe a conservative balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute our opportunistic investing principles and portfolio diversification principles. We maintain our conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining available sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of credit. Generally, we attempt to match the long-term duration of our leases with long-term fixed-rate financing.
 
In underwriting our investments, we structure and adjust the price of the investment in accordance with our assessment of risk. We may structure transactions as master leases, require indemnifications, obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or security deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk. We finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit or arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for longer-term financing through public offerings of securities or from institutional investors. We may issue debt securities or preferred or common stock. We may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we acquire. We may also obtain non-recourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance existing debt on properties acquired.
 
As of September 30, 2007, the Company's portfolio of properties, excluding assets held for sale and classified as discontinued operations, included 753 properties and consisted of:
 
 - 
                 
271 senior housing facilities,
 - 
                 
265 medical office buildings,
 - 
                 
99 life science facilities,
 -

Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.
  Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges.  The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges.  Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. 
The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding minority interests' share of earnings and gains or losses from real estate dispositions.  The Company's presentations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA herein are solely as non-GAAP liquidity measures in connection with the presentation of Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.  As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments.  The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with cash flows from operating activities, and other required measures under GAAP, to improve their understanding of the Company's liquidity.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  Also, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the Company's outstanding debt.  The Company believes cash flows from operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators.  Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
 
Fixed Charges.
 Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends.  The Company uses Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred stockholders for purposes of presenting Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.  However, the usefulness of Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO").
  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful.  The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
 
FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share.
  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio per common share provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common stockholders.
Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI").
  A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and same property performance, or "SPP."  The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property level operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, interest expense and discontinued operations.  The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis.  NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees.  The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP.  The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.  NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items.  Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
