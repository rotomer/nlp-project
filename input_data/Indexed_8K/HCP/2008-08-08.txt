Dear Sirs:
 
HCP, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with each of the Underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 10 hereof), for whom J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"), with respect to the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of 13,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") and with respect to the grant by the Company to the Underwriters of the option described in Section 2(b) hereof to purchase all or any part of 1,950,000 additional shares of Common Stock.  The aforesaid 13,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Initial Securities") to be purchased by the Underwriters and all or any part of the 1,950,000 shares of Common Stock subject to the option described in Section 2(b) hereof (the "Option Securities") are collectively hereinafter called the "Securities."
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-137225), which registration statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the rules and regulations of the Commission (the "1933 Act Regulations") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
 
amended (the "1933 Act").  Such registration statement covers the registration of the Securities (among others) under the 1933 Act.  Such registration statement, in the form in which it became effective, as amended through the date hereof, including the information deemed pursuant to Rule 430B under the 1933 Act Regulations to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness ("Rule 430B Information") and all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein through the date hereof, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement."  The Company proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations the Prospectus Supplement (as defined in Section 3(k) hereof) relating to the Securities and the prospectus dated September 8, 2006 (the "Base Prospectus"), and has previously advised you of all further information (financial and other) with respect to the Company set forth therein.  The Base Prospectus together with the Prospectus Supplement, in their respective forms on the date hereof (being the forms in which they are to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations), including all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein through the date hereof, are hereinafter referred to as, collectively, the "Prospectus," except that if any revised prospectus or prospectus supplement shall be provided to you by the Company for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities which differs from the Prospectus (whether or not such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations), the term "Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement, as the case may be, from and after the time it is first provided to you for such use.  The term "Pre-Pricing Prospectus," as used in this Agreement, means the preliminary prospectus supplement dated August 6, 2008 and filed with the Commission on August 6, 2008 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, together with the Base Prospectus used with such preliminary prospectus supplement in connection with the marketing of the Securities, in each case as amended or supplemented by the Company.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Agreement to documents, financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included," "stated," "described in" or "referred to" in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus (and all other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such documents, financial statements and schedules and other information which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), after the date of this Agreement which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.
 
The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as the Representatives deem advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered.

Indemnification of the Underwriters
 
(i)         against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information or any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h) under the 1933 Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(a) under the 1933 Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii)        against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii)       against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 6(c) hereof, the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
 
provided
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus or any Pre-Pricing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or made in reliance upon the Trustee's Form T-1 filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
however
 
(b)           .  Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the
Indemnification of the Company, Directors and Officers
meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus or any Pre-Pricing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
(c)           .  Each indemnified party shall give written notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions Against Parties; Notification
provided
however
 
(d)           .  If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
(e)           .  For purposes of this Section 6, all references to the Registration Statement, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any
EDGAR
amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, shall be deemed to include, without limitation, any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR.
 
Section 7.  .  If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions that the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it were offered exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Section 8.  .  All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.

As used in this Section 9(a), the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities.
(b)           If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof.  Notwithstanding any such termination, the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 7 and 8 shall remain in effect.

(b)           if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the total number of Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, shall have the right to postpone Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.  As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.

In our capacity as tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries, including an examination of originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion.  For purposes of our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the above

In addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of all representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification.  In our examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of natural persons executing such documents and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.
 
We are opining herein only as to the federal income tax laws of the United States, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, the laws of any state or other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any other local agencies within any state.

Any such change may affect the conclusions stated herein.  Also, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Officer's Certificates may affect the conclusions stated herein.  As described in the Prospectus Supplement, the Company's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon the Company's ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual annual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by Latham & Watkins LLP.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operation for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements.
