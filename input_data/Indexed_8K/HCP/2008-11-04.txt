LONG BEACH, CA, November 4, 2008  HCP (the "Company" or "we") (NYSE:HCP) announced results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.  Funds from operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares was $175.1 million, or $0.71 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, compared to FFO applicable to common shares of $109.0 million, or $0.52 per diluted share of common stock, in the year ago period.
 
FFO applicable to common shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 includes the impact of $0.17 per diluted share of common stock of the following i) lease termination fees of $0.07 per diluted share of common stock resulting from the early termination of three leases in our life science segment and a related impairment of $0.01 per diluted share of common stock; and ii) income of $0.11 per diluted share of common stock related to the settlement of various disputes with Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet").  FFO applicable to common shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 includes the impact of $0.01 per diluted share of common stock of the following i) merger-related charges of $0.05 per diluted share of common stock; and ii) straight-line rental income of $0.04 per diluted share of common stock, resulting from our change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight-line rental income. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is helpful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts.
 
Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 was $120.1 million, or $0.49 per diluted share of common stock, compared to net income applicable to common shares of $316.9 million, or $1.53 per diluted share of common stock, in the year ago period. Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 includes gain on sales of real estate of $27.4 million, compared to gain on sales of real estate of $286.2 million in the year ago period.
INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, we sold three hospitals valued at $116 million and made investments aggregating $89 million through the purchase of debt securities and a joint venture interest, and funding of construction and other capital projects.
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, two of our life science facilities located in South San Francisco were placed into service representing 147,000 square feet.
 
FINANCING TRANSACTIONS
 
On August 11, 2008, we issued 14.95 million shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds of $481 million, which were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our bridge loan facility.
 
In September 2008, we placed mortgage financing on senior housing assets through Fannie Mae aggregating $319 million, which was comprised of $140 million of five-year mortgage financing on four assets and $179 million of eight-year financing on 12 assets. The assets are cross-collateralized and the debt has a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 6.39%. We received net proceeds aggregating $312 million, which were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility.
 
On October 24, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a $200 million unsecured term loan. The term loan accrues interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00%, based on our current debt ratings, and matures in August 2011. The net proceeds of $197 million received by us from the term loan were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our bridge loan facility, reducing the outstanding balance to $320 million.
 
OTHER EVENTS
 
On July 30, 2008, we received and recognized lease termination fees of $18 million from a tenant in connection with the early termination of three leases representing 149,000 square feet in our life science segment. Upon termination of the leases, we recognized an impairment of $4 million related to intangible assets associated with these leases, which resulted in a net FFO impact of $14 million.
 
On September 19, 2008, we completed the restructuring of our hospital portfolio leased to Tenet and settled various disputes. The settlement provided for, among other things, the sale of our hospital in Tarzana, California, valued at $89 million, the purchase of Tenet's minority interest in a joint venture valued at $29 million and the extension of the terms of three other hospitals leased by us to Tenet. As a result of the sale of our hospital in Tarzana, California and the settlement of our legal disputes with Tenet, we recognized income of $47 million, of which $29 million, or $0.11 per diluted share of common stock, was included in FFO.
 
DIVIDEND
 
On October 30, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.455 per share. The dividend will be paid on November 21, 2008 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 10, 2008.
 
FUTURE OPERATIONS
 
For the full year 2008, we presently expect net income applicable to common shares to range between $1.88 and $1.92 per diluted common share, FFO applicable to common shares to range between $2.31 and $2.35 per diluted common share, and FFO applicable to common shares, before giving effect to merger-related charges and impairments, to range between $2.38 and $2.42 per diluted common share.

Cash Flow Coverage is a supplemental measure of a property's ability to generate cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related rent and other obligations to the Company.  However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM.  The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.

Debt Service Coverage
("DSC").
  Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM for the most recent twelve months of available data divided by Annualized Debt Service. Debt Service Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related obligations to the Company under loan agreements.  However, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM.

Management's estimate of the date the core and shell structure improvements are expected to be or have been completed.
 
 
Facility EBITDAR ("EBITDAR").

The Company uses Facility EBITDAR in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage.  Facility EBITDAR has limitations as an analytical tool.  Facility EBITDAR does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  In addition, Facility EBITDAR does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators.  However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management.  The Company utilizes Facility EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.  Facility EBITDAR includes the greater of (i) contractual management fees or (ii) an imputed management fee of 2% for acute care hospitals and 5% for skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries.  All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.

Newly acquired assets, developments and redevelopments in process and assets classified in discontinued operations are excluded from the same property portfolio.  Same property statistics allow management to evaluate the NOI of its real estate portfolio as a consistent population from period to period and eliminates the effects of changes in the composition of the properties on performance measures.

Yield.
  Yield is calculated as Net Operating Income, as adjusted, divided by total investment.  For acquisitions, initial yields are calculated as projected Net Operating Income, twelve months forward, as adjusted, as of the closing date divided by total acquisition cost.  The total acquisition cost basis includes the initial purchase price, the effects of adjusting assumed debt to market, lease intangible adjustments and all transaction costs.

Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.
  Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges.  The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges.  Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
The following table details the calculation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage:

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
 The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding minority interests' share in earnings, impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure both its operating performance and liquidity.  The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from its operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions.  By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure the Company's operating performance independent of its capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of its operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare its operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries.  The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful supplemental measure for reviewing its comparative performance with other companies because, by excluding non-cash depreciation expense, Adjusted EBITDA can help the investing public compare the performance of a real estate company to that of companies in other industries. As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments.  The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with net income (the primary measure of the Company's performance) and the other required GAAP measures of its performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of the Company's operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of its performance between periods and as against other companies.  By excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions when assessing the Company's financial performance, an investor is assessing the earnings generated by the Company's operations, but not taking into account the eliminated expenses or gains or losses from real estate dispositions incurred in connection with such operations.  As a result, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  Also, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the Company's outstanding debt.  While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity.  Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA from net cash provided by operating activities:

Financial Leverage.
 
Total Debt divided by Total Gross Assets. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies.  The Company believes that the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated gross assets is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Financial Leverage.  The Company's computation of its Financial Leverage may not be identical to the computations of financial leverage reported by other companies.  The Company's share of total debt is not intended to reflect its actual liability or ability to access assets should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.
 
Fixed Charges.
 Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends.  The Company uses Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred stockholders for purposes of presenting Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.  However, the usefulness of Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO").
  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful.  The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that
do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
For a reconciliation of FFO to net income, please refer to the slide in this supplemental information package captioned "Consolidated Funds From Operations."
 
FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share.
  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common stockholders.  FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share is subject to the same limitations noted in the definition of FFO above.
 
Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI").
  A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and SPP.  The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses. NOI excludes gain on sale of real estate interest, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, interest expense and discontinued operations.  The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis.  NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. NOI, as adjusted, is sometimes referred as "adjusted NOI" or "cash basis NOI."  The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP.  The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.  NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items.  Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
 
The following table reconciles NOI from net income:
