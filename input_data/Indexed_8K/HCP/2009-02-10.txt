The term loan accrues interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00%, based on our current debt ratings, and matures in August 2011.

On December 1, 2008, we completed the transfer of an 11-property senior housing portfolio to Emeritus Corporation ("Emeritus"). As previously announced, in connection with the transfer, we recognized impairments of lease related intangible assets of $12 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.

The Company believes that funds from operations applicable to common shares, diluted funds from operations applicable to common shares and basic and diluted funds from operations per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term funds from operations ("FFO") was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
 
FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from the Company. A reconciliation of net income applicable to common shares to FFO applicable to common shares is provided herein.

("CRP"), severance and retention-related compensation, as well as other CRP integration costs.

Except as otherwise noted above, the foregoing projections reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels, development activities, property dispositions and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release. Expect as otherwise noted, these estimates do not reflect the potential impact of future property acquisitions, impairments, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company's operators, lessees, borrowers or other obligors, the effect of any restructuring of the Company's contractual relationships with such entities, realized gains or losses on marketable securities, ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, offerings of debt or equity securities or existing and future litigation matters. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization or gains and losses associated with real estate disposition activities, but does include impairments. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. The aforementioned ranges represent management's best estimate of results based upon the underlying assumptions as of the date of this press release. Except as otherwise required by law, management assumes no, and hereby disclaims any, obligation to update any of the foregoing projections as a result of new information or new or future developments.

  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company).  The Company uses Facility EBITDAR in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage.  Facility EBITDAR has limitations as an analytical tool.  Facility EBITDAR does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  In addition, Facility EBITDAR does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators.  However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management.  The Company utilizes Facility EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.  Facility EBITDAR includes the greater of (i) contractual management fees or (ii) an imputed management fee of 2% for acute care hospitals and 5% for skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries.  All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.

  Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges.  The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges.  Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
 The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding minority interests' share in earnings, impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure both its operating performance and liquidity.  The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from its operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions.  By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure the Company's operating performance independent of its capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of its operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare its operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries.  The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful supplemental measure for reviewing its comparative performance with other companies because, by excluding non-cash depreciation expense, Adjusted EBITDA can help the investing public compare the performance of a real estate company to that of companies in other industries. As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments.  The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with net income (the primary measure of the Company's performance) and the other required GAAP measures of its performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of the Company's operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of its performance between periods and as against other companies.  By excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions when assessing the Company's financial performance, an investor is assessing the earnings generated by the Company's operations, but not taking into account the eliminated expenses or gains or losses from real estate dispositions incurred in connection with such operations.  As a result, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  Also, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the Company's outstanding debt.  While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity.  Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

Financial Leverage.
 
Total Debt divided by Total Gross Assets. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies.  The Company believes that the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated gross assets is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Financial Leverage.  The Company's computation of its Financial Leverage may not be identical to the computations of financial leverage reported by other companies.  The Company's share of total debt is not intended to reflect its actual liability or ability to access assets should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.
 
Fixed Charges.
 Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends.  The Company uses Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred stockholders for purposes of presenting Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.  However, the usefulness of Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO").
  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful.  The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
For a reconciliation of FFO to net income, please refer to the slide in this supplemental information package captioned "Consolidated Funds From Operations."
 
FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share.
  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common stockholders.  FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share is subject to the same limitations noted in the definition of FFO above.
 
Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI").  
A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and SPP.  The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses. NOI excludes investment management fee income, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain on sale of real estate interest, interest and other income, net, interest expense, income taxes, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests' share in earnings and discontinued operations.  The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis.  NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. NOI, as adjusted, is sometimes referred as "adjusted NOI" or "cash basis NOI."  The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP.  The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.  NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items.  Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
