Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On May 5, 2009, HCP, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it agreed to sell 18,000,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten offering.  The Company also granted the underwriters a thirty-day option to purchase up to 2,700,000 additional shares to cover over-allotments, if any.  The specific terms of the offering will be described in a prospectus supplement, dated May 5, 2009, relating to the offering to be filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on or about May 5, 2009.
 
The Company hereby updates its guidance for funds from operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares (diluted) and net earnings applicable to common shares (diluted) issued last week to give effect to the final terms and size of the offering as follows, excluding and including the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters:
 
 
The foregoing guidance does not reflect the potential impact of future property acquisitions, impairments, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company's operators, lessees, borrowers or other obligors, the effect of any restructuring of the Company's contractual relationships with such entities, realized gains or losses on marketable securities, ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, other offerings of debt or equity securities or existing and future litigation matters. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization or gains and losses associated with real estate disposition activities, but does include impairments. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. The aforementioned ranges represent management's best estimate of results based upon the underlying assumptions as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The Company believes that diluted FFO per common share is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
 
FFO is defined as net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from the Company
.
 
The information in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section and shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of HCP under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in any such filing.
