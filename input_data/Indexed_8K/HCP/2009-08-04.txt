LONG BEACH, CA, August 4, 2009  HCP (the "Company" or "we") (NYSE:HCP) announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Funds from operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares was $146.1 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, compared to FFO applicable to common shares of $119.1 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago period.
FFO applicable to common shares for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 included the offsetting impact of the following: i) impairments of $0.02 per diluted share; and ii) income of $0.02 per diluted share resulting from an adjustment to the cost allocation of certain assets acquired in 2006. FFO applicable to common shares for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 included the negative impact of $0.07 per diluted share of the following: i) impairments and merger-related charges of $0.05 per diluted share; ii) a write down in the carrying value of marketable securities of $0.01 per diluted share; and iii) an ineffectiveness charge of $0.01 per diluted share relating to the settlement of two forward-starting interest-rate swaps. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is helpful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts.
Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 was $91.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to net income applicable to common shares of $225.9 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 includes gain on sales of real estate of $30.5 million, compared to gain on sales of real estate of $190.5 million in the year-ago period.
INVESTMENTS
During the quarter ended June 30, 2009, we funded $30 million, for construction and other capital projects, primarily in our life science segment.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2009, we sold two hospitals with an aggregate value of $46 million and recognized gains of $30.5 million, which are excluded from FFO.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2009, we also sold marketable debt securities of $5 million.
On August 3, 2009, we purchased a $720 million participation in first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare at a discount for approximately $590 million. The $720 million participation bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% and represents 45% of the $1.6 billion most senior tranche of HCR ManorCare's mortgage debt incurred as part of the financing for The Carlyle Group's acquisition of Manor Care, Inc. in December 2007. The mortgage debt matures in January 2012, with a one-year extension available at the borrower's option subject to certain conditions, and is secured by a first lien on 331 facilities located in 30 states. We obtained favorable financing to fund 72% of the purchase price, resulting in a net cash payment by HCP of $165 million.
FINANCING
On May 8, 2009, we completed a $440 million public offering of 20.7 million shares of our common stock at a price per share of $21.25. We received net proceeds of $422 million, which were used to repay all amounts of indebtedness outstanding under our bridge loan credit facility, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes.
On June 12, 2009, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract (pay float and receive fixed) with a notional amount of $250 million that terminates in September 2011. This interest-rate swap contract reduces our net floating rate asset exposure, which increased as a result of the repayment of our floating rate bridge loan credit facility.
Our financial leverage improved to 44% at June 30, 2009 from 48% at December 31, 2008. Our adjusted fixed charge coverage for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 improved to 2.6x from 2.3x for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
OTHER EVENTS
On June 18, 2009, we announced that the management agreements on 15 communities operated by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. or its subsidiaries ("Sunrise") have been terminated effective October 1, 2009, for Sunrise's failure to achieve certain performance thresholds. The termination of the agreements does not require the payment of a termination fee by the Company or our tenants. We intend to enter into new arrangements with senior housing operators for the 15 communities, reducing the Sunrise-managed communities in the Company's portfolio to 75 from the original 101 communities the Company acquired in the 2006 CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. transaction. We expect these arrangements to improve the operating margins of the communities in a manner similar to the Company's successful transition of 11 former Sunrise communities to Emeritus Corporation in December 2008. On June 30, 2009, we recognized impairments of $6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to intangible assets associated with 12 of the 15 communities.
On June 29, 2009, we, together with three of our tenants, filed complaints against Sunrise based on Sunrise's defaults under management and related agreements covering 64 of the remaining 75 Sunrise-managed communities owned by the Company. The complaints allege, among other things, that Sunrise systematically breached various contractual and fiduciary duties. In addition to equitable relief and monetary damages relating to the defaults, we are seeking judicial confirmation of rights to terminate the agreements on the 64 communities.
DIVIDEND
On July 29, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.46 per share. The dividend will be paid on August 19, 2009 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 6, 2009.
 
 
FUTURE OPERATIONS
For the full year 2009, we presently expect net income applicable to common shares to range between $0.98 and $1.04 per diluted share, FFO applicable to common shares to range between $2.13 and $2.19 per diluted share, and FFO applicable to common shares, before giving effect to impairments, to range between $2.15 and $2.21 per diluted common share. The increase to the above guidance amounts was due to our HCR ManorCare investment on August 3, 2009.

These statements include among other things the expected improvement in operating margins resulting from the transfer of 15 Sunrise-managed communities, net income applicable to common shares on a diluted basis, FFO applicable to common shares on a diluted basis, FFO applicable to common shares on a diluted basis before giving effect to impairments, gain on sales of real estate, real estate depreciation and amortization, and joint venture adjustments for the full year of 2009. These statements are made as of the date hereof and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factorsmany of which are out of the Company's control and difficult to forecastthat could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: national and local economic conditions, including the possibility of a prolonged recession; continued volatility in the capital markets, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital, which changes and volatility affect opportunities for profitable investment; the Company's ability to access external sources of capital when desired and on reasonable terms; the Company's ability to manage its indebtedness levels; changes in the terms of the Company's indebtedness; the Company's ability to maintain its credit ratings; the potential impact of existing and future litigation matters, including related developments; the Company's ability to achieve the expected benefits from acquisitions, including integrating and preserving the goodwill of the acquired companies; the Company's ability to sell its properties when desired and on profitable terms; competition for lessees and mortgagors (including new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases); the Company's ability to reposition its properties on the same or better terms if existing leases are not renewed or the Company exercises its right to replace an existing operator or tenant upon default; continuing reimbursement uncertainty in the skilled nursing segment; competition in the senior housing segment specifically and in the healthcare industry in general; the ability of the Company's operators and tenants to maintain or increase occupancy levels at, and rental income from, the senior housing segment; the Company's ability to realize the benefits of its mezzanine investments; the ability of the Company's lessees and mortgagors to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations to the Company and other third parties; the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of the Company's operators, lessees, borrowers or other obligors; changes in healthcare laws and regulations, including the impact of future or pending healthcare reform, and other changes in the healthcare industry which affect the operations of the Company's lessees or obligors; the Company's ability to recruit and retain key management personnel; costs of compliance with regulations and environmental laws affecting the Company's properties; changes in tax laws and regulations; the Company's ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a REIT; changes in rules governing financial reporting, including new accounting pronouncements; and other risks described from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Presentation and certain computational changes have been made for the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1, to compute earnings per share and funds from operations per share under the two-class method.
Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities,
 
(2)
   
The Company believes funds from operations applicable to common shares, diluted funds from operations applicable to common shares and basic and diluted funds from operations per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term funds from operations ("FFO") was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
 
FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from the Company.

Merger-related charges in the periods ended June 30, 2008 include the amortization of fees associated with our acquisition financing for Slough Estates USA Inc. ("SEUSA"), as well as other SEUSA integration costs.

Except as otherwise noted above, the foregoing projections reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels, development activities, property dispositions and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release. Expect as otherwise noted, these estimates do not reflect the potential impact of future acquisitions, impairments, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company's operators, lessees, borrowers or other obligors, the effect of any restructuring of the Company's contractual relationships with such entities, realized gains or losses on marketable securities, ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, offerings of debt or equity securities or existing and future litigation matters. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization or gains and losses associated with real estate disposition activities, but does include impairments. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. The aforementioned ranges represent management's best estimate of results based upon the underlying assumptions as of the date of this press release. Except as otherwise required by law, management assumes no, and hereby disclaims any, obligation to update any of the foregoing projections as a result of new information or new or future developments.
 
 
Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.
Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges. The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company. However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges. Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
 
Consolidated Debt
represents the carrying amount of bank line of credit, bridge and term loans, senior unsecured notes, mortgage debt and other debt as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Consolidated Gross Assets
represents the carrying amount of total assets, excluding investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization, as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Consolidated Secured Debt
represents mortgage debt secured by real estate as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
represents the real estate industry' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure both its operating performance and liquidity. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from its operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure the Company's operating performance independent of its capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of its operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare its operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments. The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with net income (the primary measure of the Company's performance) and the other required GAAP measures of its performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of the Company's operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of its performance between periods and as against other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity. Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
 
Financial Leverage
represents Total Debt divided by Total Gross Assets. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. The Company believes that the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated gross assets is the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") measure to Financial Leverage. The Company's computation of its financial leverage may not be identical to the computations of financial leverage reported by other companies. The Company's share of total debt is not intended to reflect its actual liability or ability to access assets should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.
 
Investment Management Platform ("IMP")
includes the following unconsolidated joint ventures: (i) HCP Life Science, (ii) HCP Ventures II, (iii) HCP Ventures III, LLC and (iv) HCP Ventures IV, LLC.
 
Total Debt
represents Consolidated Debt plus the Company's pro rata share of debt from the Investment Management Platform.
 
Total Gross Assets
represents the Consolidated Gross Assets plus the Company's pro rata share of total assets from the Investment Management Platform, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization.

Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.
  Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges.  The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges.  Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.

Cash Flow Coverage is a supplemental measure of a property's ability to generate cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related rent and other obligations to the Company.  However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM.

Debt Service Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related obligations to the Company under loan agreements.  However, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDA(R) or Facility EBITDA(R)M.  The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
 The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure both its operating performance and liquidity.  The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from its operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions.  By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure the Company's operating performance independent of its capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of its operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare its operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments. The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with net income (the primary measure of the Company's performance) and the other required GAAP measures of its performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of the Company's operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of its performance between periods and as against other companies.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity.  Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
 
The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA from net income:

Facility EBITDAR ("EBITDA(R)").
  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company), for the trailing twelve months and one quarter in arrears from the date presented. The Company uses Facility EBITDA(R) in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage.  Facility EBITDA(R) has limitations as an analytical tool.  Facility EBITDA(R) does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  In addition, Facility EBITDA(R) does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators.  However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management.  The Company utilizes Facility EBITDA(R) as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.  Facility EBITDA(R) includes the greater of (i) contractual management fees or (ii) an imputed management fee of 2% for acute care hospitals and 5% for skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries.  All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
 
Facility EBITDA(R)M ("EBITDA(R)M").
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company
), for the trailing twelve months and one quarter in arrears from the date presented.  The Company uses Facility EBITDA(R)M in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage.  Facility EBITDA(R)M has limitations as an analytical tool.  Facility EBITDA(R)M does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  In addition, Facility EBITDA(R)M does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators.  However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management.  The Company utilizes Facility EBITDA(R)M as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.  All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
 
Financial Leverage.
 
Total Debt divided by Total Gross Assets. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies.  The Company believes that the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated gross assets is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Financial Leverage.  The Company's computation of its Financial Leverage may not be identical to the computations of financial leverage reported by other companies.  The Company's share of total debt is not intended to reflect its actual liability or ability to access assets should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.
 
Fixed Charges.
 Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends.  The Company uses Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred stockholders for purposes of presenting Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.  However, the usefulness of Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO").
  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP.  FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful.  The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies.  While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
For a reconciliation of FFO to net income, please refer to the slide in this supplemental information package captioned "Consolidated Funds From Operations."
 
FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share.
  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common stockholders.  FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share is subject to the same limitations noted in the definition of FFO above.
 
 
 
HCP Life Science.
  Includes three unconsolidated joint ventures between the Company and an institutional capital partner for which the Company is the managing member.  HCP Life Science includes the following partnerships: (i) Torrey Pines Science Center LP (50%), (ii) Britannia Biotech Gateway LP (55%) and (iii) LASDK LP (63%).  The unconsolidated joint ventures were acquired as part of the Company's purchase of Slough Estates USA Inc. on August 1, 2007.

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals ("LTACHs").
  LTACHs provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require longer stays and more intensive care, monitoring or emergency back-up than that available in most skilled nursing-based programs.
 
Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI").
  A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and SPP.  The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses.  NOI excludes investment management fee income, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, interest and other income, net, interest expense, income taxes, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures and discontinued operations.  The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis.  NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL interest accretion, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. NOI, as adjusted, is sometimes referred as "adjusted NOI" or "cash basis NOI."  The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP.  The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.  NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items.  Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
The following table reconciles NOI from net income:

Occupancy
.
  For MOBs and life science facilities, occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased where rental payments have commenced, including month-to-month leases, as of the end of the period reported. For hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities, occupancy represents the facilities' average operating occupancy for the trailing twelve months and one quarter in arrears from the date reported. The percentages are calculated based on licensed beds, available beds and units for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities, respectively.  The percentages shown exclude newly completed facilities under lease-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.  All facility financial performance data were derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company. For the same property portfolio, occupancy for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities are presented based on the average operating occupancy for trailing three-month period one quarter in arrears from the date reported.
Owned Portfolio.
  Represents owned properties subject to operating leases and DFLs and debt investments, and excludes properties under and land held for future development.
 
Pooled Leases.

.
 
Same Period Rent.
  The base rent plus additional rent due to the Company over the most recent trailing twelve-month period as of period end.  The Company uses Same Period Rent for purposes of determining property-level Cash Flow Coverage.
 
Same Property Portfolio ("SPP").
  An important component of the Company's evaluation of the operating performance of its properties.  The Company defines its same property portfolio each quarter as those properties that have been in operation throughout the current year and the prior year and that were also in operation at January 1st of the prior year.  Newly acquired assets, developments and redevelopments in process and assets classified in discontinued operations are excluded from the same property portfolio.  Same property statistics allow management to evaluate the NOI of its real estate portfolio as a consistent population from period to period and eliminates the effects of changes in the composition of the properties on performance measures.
 
Senior Housing.
  ALFs, ILFs and CCRCs.  For reporting purposes, the Company's senior housing portfolio also includes a school formerly operated as an assisted living facility and six health and wellness centers.
