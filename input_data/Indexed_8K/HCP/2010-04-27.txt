LONG BEACH, CA, April 27, 2010  HCP (the "Company" or "we") (NYSE:HCP) announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. Funds from operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares, before giving effect to income from impairment recoveries of $11.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, was $146.8 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. No impairments or impairment recoveries were incurred in the year-ago period. FFO applicable to common shares was $158.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, compared to FFO applicable to common shares of $128.0 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is helpful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts.
 
Net income applicable to common shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 was $74.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to net income applicable to common shares of $43.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the year-ago period.
 
INVESTMENTS
During the quarter ended March 31, 2010, we made investments of $36 million, which included the acquisition of a senior housing facility for $9 million and funding of $27 million for construction and other capital projects, primarily in our life science segment.
 
During the quarter ended March 31, 2010, three life science facilities located in South San Francisco were placed in service representing 329,000 square feet.
FINANCINGS
On March 10, 2010, we repaid the total outstanding indebtedness of $200 million under our term loan. The term loan, with an original maturity of August 1, 2011, was repaid primarily with funds available under our revolving line of credit facility. As a result of the early repayment of the term loan, we recognized a charge of $1.3 million, related to unamortized issuance costs.
 
ERICKSON SETTLEMENT
In February 2010, we entered into a settlement agreement with Erickson Retirement Communities ("Erickson"), which filed for bankruptcy in October 2009. On April 15, 2010, the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement and confirmed Erickson's final plan of reorganization. The settlement agreement and plan of reorganization provide that we will, concurrently with the closing of the sale of Erickson's assets, be entitled to: (i) retain deposits held by us with balances of $5 million as of March 31, 2010; and (ii) receive an additional $9.6 million. The closing is expected to occur on April 30, 2010, and remains subject to customary closing conditions. As a result, during the quarter ended March 31, 2010, we recognized aggregate income of $11.9 million, which represents impairment recoveries of portions of previous impairment charges related to investments in three direct financing leases and a participation interest in a senior construction loan related to Erickson.
 
DIVIDEND
On April 22, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.465 per share. The dividend will be paid on May 18, 2010 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 3, 2010.
 
OUTLOOK
For the full year 2010, we expect FFO applicable to common shares to range between $2.11 and $2.17 per diluted share, before giving effect to impairment recoveries; FFO applicable to common shares to range between $2.15 and $2.21 per diluted share; and net income applicable to common shares to range between $1.04 and $1.10 per diluted share. These estimates do not include possible future gains or losses, the impact on operating results from possible future acquisitions or dispositions, or possible future impairments or recoveries.

The Company believes funds from operations applicable to common shares, diluted funds from operations applicable to common shares and basic and diluted funds from operations per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term funds from operations ("FFO") was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
 
FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from the Company.
 
 
 
(1)
 
The Company believes Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI") provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis. NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and SPP. The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
 
NOI is defined as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses. NOI excludes investment management fee income, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, litigation provision, impairments, impairment recoveries, interest and other income, net, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures and discontinued operations. NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL interest accretion, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. NOI, as adjusted, is sometimes referred as "adjusted NOI" or "cash basis NOI."
 
(2)
 
The Company believes same property portfolio ("SPP") is an important component of the Company's evaluation of the operating performance of its properties. The Company defines its same property portfolio each quarter as those properties that have been in operation throughout the current year and the prior year and that were also in operation at January 1st of the prior year. Newly acquired assets, developments and redevelopments in process and assets classified in discontinued operations are excluded from the same property portfolio. Same property statistics allow management to evaluate the NOI of the Company's real estate portfolio as a consistent population from period to period and eliminates the effects of changes in the composition of the properties on performance measures. SPP NOI excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.

Except as otherwise noted above, the foregoing projections reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels, development activities, property dispositions and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release. Except as otherwise noted, these estimates do not reflect the potential impact of future acquisitions, impairments, impairment recoveries, the future bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company's operators, lessees, borrowers or other obligors, the effect of any future restructuring of the Company's contractual relationships with such entities, realized gains or losses on marketable securities, ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, offerings of debt or equity securities or existing and future litigation matters including the possibility of larger than expected litigation costs and related developments. By definition, FFO does not include real estate-related depreciation and amortization or gains and losses associated with real estate disposition activities, but does include impairments. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. The aforementioned ranges represent management's best estimate of results based upon the underlying assumptions as of the date of this press release. Except as otherwise required by law, management assumes no, and hereby disclaims any, obligation to update any of the foregoing projections as a result of new information or new or future developments.

Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.
  Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges.  The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company.  However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges.  Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
 
The following table details the calculation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage:
 
 
Annualized Debt Service
.
  The most recent monthly interest and principal amortization due to HCP as of period end annualized for twelve months.  The Company uses Annualized Debt Service for purposes of determining Debt Service Coverage.
 
Annualized Revenues.
  The most recent monthly base rent (including add rent floors), income from direct financing leases and/or interest income annualized for twelve months.  Annualized Revenues do not include tenant recoveries, additional rents in excess of floors and non-cash revenue adjustments (i.e., straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, interest accretion and deferred revenues).  The Company uses Annualized Revenues for the purpose of determining Relationship Concentrations, Lease Expirations and Debt Investment Maturities.
 
Assets Held for Sale
.
  Assets of discontinued operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, .
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
Assisted Living Facility ("ALF"). 
A senior housing facility that predominantly consists of assisted living units is classified by the Company as an ALF.
 
Beds/Units/Square Feet.
  Senior housing facilities are measured in units (e.g., studio, one or two bedroom units).  MOBs and life science facilities are measured in square feet. Hospitals and skilled nursing facilities are measured in licensed bed count.
 
Cash Flow Coverage ("CFC"). 
Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM for the most recent twelve months of available data divided by the Same Period Rent.  Cash Flow Coverage is a supplemental measure of a property's ability to generate cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related rent and other obligations to the Company.  However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM.  The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.
 
Consolidated Assets.
  Total assets as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Consolidated Debt.
  The carrying amount of bank line of credit, bridge and term loans (if applicable), senior unsecured notes, mortgage and other secured debt, and other debt as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Debt Service
. 
The periodic payment of interest expense and principal amortization on secured loans.
 
Debt Service Coverage
("DSC").
  Facility EBITDA(R) or Facility EBITDA(R)M for the most recent twelve months of available data divided by Annualized Debt Service. Debt Service Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related obligations to the Company under loan agreements.  However, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDA(R) or Facility EBITDA(R)M.  The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.
 
Development.
  Includes ground-up construction and redevelopments.
 
Direct Financing Lease ("DFL").
  The Company uses the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs.  For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable.  The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income.  Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield.
 
Estimated Completion Date.
 
For development projects, management's estimate of the date the core and shell structure improvements are expected to be or have been completed.  For redevelopment projects, management's estimate of the time in which major construction activity in relation to the scope of the project has been substantially completed.
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
 The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure both its operating performance and liquidity.  The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from its operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, impairments, impairment recoveries, litigation provision and gains or losses from real estate dispositions.  By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure the Company's operating performance independent of its capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of its operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare its operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments. The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with net income (the primary measure of the Company's performance) and the other required GAAP measures of its performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of the Company's operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of its performance between periods and as against other companies.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity.  Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
 
The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA from net income (loss):
 
 
Facility EBITDA(R) ("EBITDA(R)").
 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company), for the trailing twelve months and one quarter in arrears from the date presented. The Company uses Facility EBITDA(R) in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage.  Facility EBITDA(R) has limitations as an analytical tool.  Facility EBITDA(R) does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  In addition, Facility EBITDA(R) does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators.  However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management.  The Company utilizes Facility EBITDA(R) as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.  Facility EBITDA(R) includes the greater of (i) contractual management fees or (ii) an imputed management fee of 2% for acute care hospitals and 5% for skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries.  All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
 
Facility EBITDA
(R)
M ("EBITDA
(R)
M").
 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company
), for the trailing twelve months and one quarter in arrears from the date presented.  The Company uses Facility EBITDA(R)M in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage.  Facility EBITDA(R)M has limitations as an analytical tool.  Facility EBITDA(R)M does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments.  In addition, Facility EBITDA(R)M does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators.  However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management.  The Company utilizes Facility
EBITDA
(R)M as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.  All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
 
Financial Leverage.
 
Total Debt divided by Total Gross Assets. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies.  The Company believes that the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated gross assets is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Financial Leverage.  The Company's computation of its Financial Leverage may not be identical to the computations of financial leverage reported by other companies.  The Company's share of total debt is not intended to reflect its actual liability or ability to access assets should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.
 
Fixed Charges.
 Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends.  The Company uses Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred stockholders for purposes of presenting Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.  However, the usefulness of Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO").
  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP.  FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful.  The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies.  While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
For a reconciliation of FFO to net income, please refer to the slide in this supplemental information package captioned "Consolidated Funds From Operations."
 
FFO Payout Ratio.
  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common stockholders.  FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share is subject to the same limitations noted in the definition of FFO above.
 
HCP Life Science.
  Includes three unconsolidated joint ventures between the Company and an institutional capital partner for which the Company is the managing member.  HCP Life Science includes the following partnerships: (i) Torrey Pines Science Center LP (50%), (ii) Britannia Biotech Gateway LP (55%) and (iii) LASDK LP (63%).  The unconsolidated joint ventures were acquired as part of the Company's purchase of Slough Estates USA Inc. on August 1, 2007.
 
HCP Ventures II.
  An unconsolidated joint venture formed on January 5, 2007 between the Company and an institutional capital partner, for which the Company is the managing member and has a 35% interest.
 
HCP Ventures III. 
An unconsolidated joint venture formed on October 27, 2006 between the Company and an institutional capital partner, for which the Company is the managing member and has an effective 25.5% interest.
 
HCP Ventures IV.
  An unconsolidated joint venture formed on April 30, 2007 between the Company and an institutional capital partner, for which the Company is the managing member and has a 20% interest.
 
Independent Living Facility ("ILF").
  A senior housing facility that predominantly consists of independent living units.

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals ("LTACHs").
  LTACHs provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require longer stays and more intensive care, monitoring or emergency back-up than that available in most skilled nursing-based programs.
Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI").
  A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and SPP.  The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses.  NOI excludes interest income, investment management fee income, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, litigation provision, impairments, impairment recoveries, other income, net, interest expense, income taxes, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures and discontinued operations.  The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis.  NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL interest accretion, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. NOI, as adjusted, is sometimes referred as "adjusted NOI" or "cash basis NOI."  The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP.  The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.  NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items.  Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
 
The following table reconciles NOI from net income:
 
 
Occupancy
.
  For MOBs and life science facilities, occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased where rental payments have commenced, including month-to-month leases, as of the end of the period reported. For hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities, occupancy represents the facilities' average operating occupancy for the trailing twelve months and one quarter in arrears from the date reported. The percentages are calculated based on licensed beds, available beds and units for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities, respectively. The percentages shown exclude newly completed facilities under lease-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.  All facility financial performance data were derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company. For the same property portfolio, occupancy for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities are presented based on the average operating occupancy for trailing three-month period one quarter in arrears from the date reported.
 
Owned Portfolio.
  Represents owned properties subject to operating leases and DFLs and debt investments, and excludes properties under development, including redevelopment, and land held for future development.
 
Pooled Leases.
  Two or more leases to the same operator/tenant or their subsidiaries under which their obligations are combined by virtue of a master lease, or multiple master leases, a pooling agreement, or multiple pooling agreements, or cross-guaranties. Sunrise Senior Living percentage pooled consists of 75 assets under 11 separate pools.
 
Redevelopment Projects.
  Properties that require significant capital expenditures (generally more than 25% of acquired cost or existing basis) to achieve stabilization or to change the use of the properties.
 
Rehabilitation Hospitals ("Rehab").
  Rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses, such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, head injuries, orthopedic problems, work-related disabilities and neurological diseases.
 
Rental Revenues.
  Represents rental and related revenues, tenant recoveries and
income from direct financing leases.
 
Retention Rate.
  The Company defines retention rate as the ratio of total square feet expiring and available for lease to total renewed square feet, excluding the square feet for tenant leases terminated for default or buy-out prior to the expiration of their lease
.
 
Same Period Rent.
  The base rent plus additional rent due to the Company over the most recent trailing twelve-month period as of period end.  The Company uses Same Period Rent for purposes of determining property-level Cash Flow Coverage.
 
Same Property Portfolio ("SPP").
  An important component of the Company's evaluation of the operating performance of its properties.  The Company defines its same property portfolio each quarter as those properties that have been in operation throughout the current year and the prior year and that were also in operation at January 1st of the prior year.  Newly acquired assets, developments and redevelopments in process and assets classified in discontinued operations are excluded from the same property portfolio.  Same property statistics allow management to evaluate the NOI of the Company's real estate portfolio as a consistent population from period to period and eliminates the effects of changes in the composition of the properties on performance measures. SPP NOI excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
Senior Housing.
  ALFs, ILFs and CCRCs.  For reporting purposes, the Company's senior housing portfolio also includes a school formerly operated as an assisted living facility and six health and wellness centers.
 
Specialty Hospitals.
  Specialty hospitals are licensed as acute care hospitals but focus on providing care in specific areas such as cardiac, orthopedic and women's conditions, or specific procedures such as surgery and are less likely to provide emergency services.
 
Square Feet.
  The square footage for properties, excluding square footage for development or redevelopment properties prior to completion.
 
Stabilization.
  Assets are considered stabilized at the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy or one year from the completion of development or redevelopment activities.

Total Secured Debt.
 Consolidated secured debt plus the Company's pro rata share of mortgage debt from the Investment Management Platform.
 
Yield.
  Yield is calculated as Net Operating Income, as adjusted, divided by total investment.  For acquisitions, initial yields are calculated as projected Net Operating Income, twelve months forward, as adjusted, as of the closing date divided by total acquisition cost.  The total acquisition cost basis includes the initial purchase price, the effects of adjusting assumed debt to market, lease intangible adjustments and all transaction costs.
