 Item 2.02.             Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On October 12, 2010, HCP, Inc. (the "Company") concluded that its 35% interest in HCP Ventures II, an unconsolidated joint venture that owns 25 senior housing properties (the "Properties") leased by Horizon Bay Communities or certain of its affiliates (collectively "Horizon Bay"), was impaired. The impairment resulted from the deterioration of the recent and projected operating performance of the Properties. For the third quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $72 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, related to its investment in HCP Ventures II. In addition, HCP Ventures II concluded it should not recognize non-cash rents (i.e., straight-line rents, including deferred rental payments) from Horizon Bay effective July 1, 2010. HCP Ventures II's determination to cease recognizing straight-line rents from Horizon Bay is expected to reduce the Company's share in earnings from HCP Ventures II by $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the second half of 2010. The Company maintains its estimated full-year 2010 FFO guidance range before net impairments of $2.10 - $2.16 per diluted share.
 
The Company acquired the Properties as part of its October 2006 acquisition of CNL Retirement Properties, Inc.  On January 5, 2007, the Company contributed the Properties (then valued at $1.1 billion and encumbered by a secured debt facility of $686 million) to form a joint venture with an institutional capital partner; the Company retained a 35% interest in the unconsolidated joint venture and the role of managing member.
