On November 17, 2010, Kenneth B. Roath, a member of the Board of Directors of HCP, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plan on behalf of his family trust (the "Sales Plan").  Under the Sales Plan, Mr. Roath has instructed his broker to sell up to 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock during the period between December 3, 2010 and October 31, 2011 so long as the market price of the Company's common stock is higher than minimum threshold prices specified in the Sales Plan.
 
The Sales Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
 
Transactions under the Sales Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
