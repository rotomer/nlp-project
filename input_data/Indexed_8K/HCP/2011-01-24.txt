Section 7.  .

Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions that the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it were offered exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each agent of an Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Section 8.  .  All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.

As used in this Section 9(a), the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities.

(b)           if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, shall have the right to postpone Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.  As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.

and 6.750% Senior Notes due 2041
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to HCP, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering by the Company of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.700% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes"), $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.750% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes"), $1,200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.375% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.750% Senior Notes due 2041 (together with the 2014 Notes, the 2016 Notes and the 2021 Notes, the "Securities") issuable pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 1, 1993 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 24, 2011 (the "Supplemental Indenture," and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company N.A., as successor trustee to The Bank of New York (the "Trustee").  The Company entered into an underwriting agreement, dated as of January 19, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to the sale of the Securities by the Company to the Underwriters.
 
This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act").
 
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of:
 
(i)
                                    
the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-161721) of the Company relating to the Securities and other securities of the Company filed on September 4, 2009 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the "Rules and Regulations"), including the information deemed to be a part of the registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B of the Rules and Regulations (such registration statement, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement");

an executed copy of the Base Indenture;
 
(iii)
                              
an executed copy of the Supplemental Indenture;
 
(iv)
                             
the certificates evidencing each of the Securities (the "Note Certificates");

an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement; and

the certificates of J. Alberto Gonzalez-Pita, Executive Vice President, General Counsel, and Thomas M. Herzog, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the Company, dated the date hereof, relating to the Securities pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 of the Indenture.
 
We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth below.
 
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.  In making our examination of executed documents, we have assumed that the parties thereto had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and the execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties.  We have also assumed that the Company has complied and will comply with all aspects of the laws of all relevant jurisdictions (including the laws of the State of Maryland) in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Indenture and the Registration Statement.  As to any facts material to the opinion expressed herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others and of public officials.
 
The opinion set forth below is subject to the following further qualifications, assumptions and limitations:
 
(a)           the Company has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform all its obligations under each of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and each Note Certificate;
 
(b)           each of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and each Note Certificate has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Companyand duly executed and delivered by the Company under the laws of the State of Maryland;
 
(c)           we do not express any opinion as to the effect of the opinion expressed herein of (i) the compliance or noncompliance of any party to the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the Securities (other than with respect to the Company to the extent necessary to render the opinion set forth herein) with any state, federal or other laws or regulations applicable to it or them or (ii) the legal or regulatory status or the nature of the business of any such party (other than with respect to the Company to the extent necessary to render the opinion set forth herein);
 
(d)           the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance of its obligations under, the Securities and the Indenture will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its properties is subject; (ii) any law, rule or regulation to which the Company or any of its properties is subject; (iii) any judicial or regulatory order or decree of any governmental authority; or (iv) any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority;
 
(e)           the validity or enforcement of any agreements or instruments may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
 
(f)            we do not express any opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer, preference or similar law on each of the Securities or any transactions contemplated thereby;
 
(g)           we do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to indemnification or contribution that may be violative of the public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation);
 
(h)           we do not express any opinion as to the enforceability in certain circumstances under California law of provisions in the Indenture or the Securities that
 
impose penalties, forfeitures, late payment charges, interest-on-interest or an increase in interest rate upon delinquent payment or the occurrence of a default;
 
(i)            to the extent any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of California law and choice of California forum provisions of the Indenture or the Securities, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon Section 1646.5 of the California Civil Code and Section 410.40 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction;
 
(j)            we note that we have assumed that each party to the Indenture, the Note Certificates or the Underwriting Agreement will enforce its rights in a commercially reasonable manner;
 
(k)           we do not express any opinion with respect to the effect of California Civil Code Section 711 on any provisions that could be a restraint on alienation of property; and
 
(l)            we have assumed that the Indenture, the Note Certificates and the Underwriting Agreement accurately reflect the intention of the parties.
 
Our opinion set forth herein is limited to those laws of the State of California and the State of New York that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law").  We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such law (other than Opined on Law) on the opinion herein stated.  Insofar as the opinion expressed herein relates to matters governed by laws other than Opined on Law, we have assumed, without having made any independent investigation, that such laws do not affect the opinion set forth herein.  The opinion expressed herein is based on laws in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable laws.
 
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
When duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, being filed on the date hereof, and incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.  We hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Validity of the Notes" in the prospectus supplement dated January 19, 2011 and filed with the Commission.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations.

(viii)
       
such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein.
 
In addition, you have provided us with, and we are relying upon, a certificate containing certain factual statements, factual representations and covenants of officers of HCP (the "") relating to, among other things, the actual and proposed operations of HCP and the entities in which it holds, or has held, a direct or indirect interest (collectively, the "").  These representations and covenants relate, in some cases, to transactions and investments for which we did not act as the Company's primary counsel.  For purposes of our opinion, we have not independently verified all of the facts, statements, representations and covenants set forth in the Officers' Certificate, the Offering Documents or in any other document.  In particular, we note that the Company may engage in transactions in which we have not provided legal advice, and have not reviewed, and of which we may be unaware.  We have, consequently, assumed and relied on your representation that the statements, representations and covenants contained in the Officers' Certificate, the Offering Documents and other documents, or otherwise furnished to us, accurately and completely describe all material facts relevant to our opinion.  We have assumed that such facts, statements, representations and covenants are true without regard to any qualification as to knowledge, belief, intent or materiality.  Our opinion is conditioned on the continuing accuracy and completeness of such facts, statements, representations and covenants.  We are not aware of any facts inconsistent with such statements, representations and covenants.  We have, at the Company's request, also assumed for purposes of our opinion that any legal opinion received by the Company on or beforeNovember 8, 2010, to the effect that the Company was taxable as a real estate investment trust (a "") under Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), is correct. Any material change or inaccuracy in the facts referred to, set forth or assumed herein or in the Officers' Certificate, including the correctness of any such prior legal opinion, may affect our conclusions set forth herein.

In our review of certain documents in connection with our opinion as expressed below, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic or electronic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.  Where documents have been provided to us in draft form,
we have assumed that the final executed versions of such documents will not differ materially from such drafts.
 
Our opinion is also based on the correctness of the following assumptions: (i) HCP and each of the entities comprising the Company has been and will continue to be operated in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was formed and in the manner described in the relevant organizational documents, (ii) there will be no changes in the applicable laws of the State of Maryland or of any other jurisdiction under the laws of which any of the entities comprising the Company have been formed and (iii) each of the written agreements to which the Company is a party has been and will be implemented, construed and enforced in accordance with its terms.
 
In rendering our opinion, we have considered and relied upon the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder (""), administrative rulings and other Treasury interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the Internal Revenue Service (""), all as they exist at the date hereof.  It should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect.  A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our conclusions set forth herein.  In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel's best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position if asserted by the IRS.

We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States.  We express no opinion on any issue relating to HCP or any investment therein, other than as expressly stated herein.
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, commencing with HCP's taxable year that ended on December 31, 1985, HCP has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation through the date of this letter has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will continue to enable, it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code thereafter.  As noted in the Offering Documents, HCP's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual operating results, certain requirements relating to the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and various other qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us.  Accordingly, no
assurance can be given that the actual results of HCP's operation for any one taxable year will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
 
We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form 8-K, filed with the Commission on January 24, 2011 and to the reference to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP under the caption "Supplemental Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission.  This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.
