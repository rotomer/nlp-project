Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
.
 
On March 11, 2011, HCP, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("HCP," "Company," "we" or "our"), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement"), by and among the Company, as borrower, the lenders referred to therein, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The New Credit Agreement replaces the Company's existing $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement, the Company has the right to increase the facility by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, so long as no default or event of default is continuing and other customary conditions have been satisfied. Any such increase will be syndicated on a best efforts basis and no lender is required to increase its commitment under the New Credit Agreement to facilitate such increase. The New Credit Agreement includes sublimits of (i) up to $150 million for letters of credit, (ii) up to 10% of the facility for swingline loans, (iii) up to $250 million for loans in certain alternative currencies and (iv) up to 50% of the facility for certain negotiated rate loans.
 
The New Credit Agreement matures on the fourth anniversary of the closing date. However, at its sole option, the Company may elect a one-time 12-month extension of the maturity of the New Credit Agreement, so long as no default or event of default exists at the time of the request or on the fourth anniversary of the closing date, the Company pays a fee equal to the product of 0.30% multiplied by the then aggregate commitments under the facility and other customary conditions have been satisfied.
 
The Company's obligations under the New Credit Agreement rank pari passu with other unsecured, unsubordinated general obligations of the Company. Loans outstanding under the New Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.325% to 2.00% based on the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of the Company. Negotiated rate loans pursuant to the New Credit Agreement bear interest at the rate agreed to between the Company and the applicable lender. The Company is also obligated to pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the revolving commitments (regardless of usage thereof) at a rate per annum ranging from 0.275% to 0.50% based on its senior unsecured long-term debt ratings and a fronting fee of 0.125% on alternative currency loans and letters of credit.
 
The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the New Credit Agreement were made only for purposes of the New Credit Agreement and as of the specific date (or dates) set forth therein, and were solely for the benefit of the parties to the New Credit Agreement and may be subject to certain limitations as agreed upon by the contracting parties. In addition, the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the New Credit Agreement may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries of the New Credit Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants contained therein, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of the Company. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date (or dates) of the New Credit Agreement, which subsequent developments may not be fully reflected in the Company's public disclosure.
 
Certain of the lenders party to the New Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates engage in financial advisory, investment banking, commercial banking or other transactions of a financial nature with the Company and its subsidiaries, including the provision of advisory services for which they receive certain fees, expense reimbursement or other payments.
 
The foregoing description of the New Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the New Credit Agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 7.01
                                          
Regulation FD Disclosure.
On March 15, 2011, we issued a press release updating our fullyear 2011 guidance as set forth below. The text of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is specifically incorporated by reference herein.
 
In connection with the participation of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Flaherty, at Citi's 2011 Global Property CEO Conference, we are updating our full-year 2011 guidance as follows: we expect Funds From Operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares to range between $2.49 and $2.55 per share; FFO as adjusted applicable to common shares to range between $2.62 and $2.68 per share; Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") applicable to common shares to range between $2.05 and $2.11 per share; and net income applicable to common shares to range between $1.61 and $1.67 per share.
 
Our 2011 FFO guidance was increased by $0.04 per share to reflect the net effect of the following recent developments:
 
(i) a combined positive impact of $0.06 per share from the early repayment of our debt investments in Genesis Corporation (anticipated on or about April 1, 2011), which impact includes:
 
(a)
        
$0.09 per share related to the recognition of the remaining unamortized loan discounts and a termination fee,
(b)
        
$0.04 per share related to the anticipated benefit from the use of the $330 million of repayment proceeds, partially offset by
(c)
         
($0.07) per share related to the loss of interest from these loans;
 
(ii)
         
a negative impact of ($0.04) per share resulting from our March 2011 decision to place the Cirrus loan on non-accrual status of accounting as the amount and timing of payments from this loan have become less certain; and
 
(iii) $0.02 per share net benefit representing numerous other items.
 
Guidance Range for 2011
 
 
(1)
   
Except as otherwise noted above, the foregoing projections reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels, development items, and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this report. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. The aforementioned ranges represent management's best estimate of results based upon the underlying assumptions as of the date of this report. Except as otherwise required by law, management assumes no, and hereby disclaims any, obligation to update any of the foregoing projections as a result of new information or new or future developments.
 
(2)
   
Merger-related items of $0.13 per share related to the previously announced HCR ManorCare acquisition include the following:
 
(i) $0.06 per share of direct transaction costs, which consists of: (a) $0.03 per share of professional fees and (b) $0.03 per share of amortization of costs associated with the bridge loan commitment;
(ii) $0.13 per share of negative carry related to prefunding the transaction, which includes the impact of: (a) the $1.472 billion, or 46 million shares, common stock offering completed on December 20, 2010 on the calculation of weighted average shares and (b) the additional interest expense and amortization of fees associated with the $2.4 billion senior unsecured notes offering completed on January 24, 2011. Proceeds from these offerings will be used to fund the cash consideration of the HCR ManorCare acquisition; which are partially offset by
(iii) ($0.06) per share of income related to gains upon the reinvestment of the Company's debt investment in HCR ManorCare and other miscellaneous items.
 
The Company believes FFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
 
FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or "GAAP"), excluding gains or losses from real estate transactions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from the Company.
 
FFO as adjusted represents FFO before the impact of impairments, recoveries, merger-related items (described above) and litigation provision. Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income.
 
Funds Available for Distribution is defined as FFO as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) straight-line rents; (ii) amortization of acquired above/below market lease intangibles; (iii) amortization of debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs; (iv) amortization of stockbased compensation expense; (v) accretion and depreciation related to direct financing leases; and (vi) deferred revenues. Further, FAD is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and includes similar adjustments to compute the Company's share of FAD from its unconsolidated joint ventures. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating FAD, and accordingly, HCP's FAD may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although HCP's FAD computation may not be comparable to that of other REITs, management believes FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of the Company's ability to fund its ongoing dividend payments. In addition, management believes that in order to further understand and analyze the Company's liquidity, FAD should be compared with cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP and presented in its consolidated financial statements. FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP, and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indication of the Company's performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, or as a measure of the Company's liquidity.

Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of all such funds, the Administrative Agent shall disburse to the Borrower on such date such Negotiated Rate Loan in like funds at the Borrower's account specified in the relevant Negotiated Rate Loan Notice.

If the Administrative Agent makes such advance, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from the Lender on whose behalf such advance was made, and if such Lender does not pay the Administrative Agent the amount of such advance on demand, the Borrower shall promptly repay such amount to the Administrative Agent.  Until such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent by such Lender or the Borrower, such advance shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Negotiated Rate Loan made by the Administrative Agent.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Negotiated Rate Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

General
.  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative
 
Currency, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States.  If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein, including without limitation the Alternative Currency Fronting Lender's Alternative Currency Funding Applicable Percentage of any payment made with respect to any Revolving Loan as to which any Alternative Currency Participating Lender has not funded its Alternative Currency Risk Participation) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, such due date shall be extended to the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the Loans constituting such Borrowing.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  In the event the Borrower pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall reduce the principal amount of such Borrowing.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Revolving Loan included in such Committed Borrowing.  Any payment by

.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Revolving Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Revolving Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans and Alternative Currency Risk Participations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Revolving Loans or such other amounts owing them, as applicable, that:

HCP ENTERS INTO $1.5 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT
AND UPDATES FULL-YEAR 2011 GUIDANCE
 
LONG BEACH, CA  March 15, 2011  HCP, Inc. (NYSE:HCP) entered into a new $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility on Friday, March 11, 2011, which replaced the existing facility that was scheduled to mature in August 2011.
 
HCP's new facility has a four-year term with a one-year committed extension option.  Based on HCP's current credit ratings, the facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 165 basis points and has a facility fee of 35 basis points.  HCP has the right to increase the commitments under the new facility by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, subject to customary conditions.
 
Bank of America, N.A., serves as administrative agent with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, Citibank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and UBS Loan Finance, LLC, as co-documentation agents and a syndicate of banks, as lenders.
 
UPDATED FULL-YEAR 2011 GUIDANCE
 
In connection with the participation of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Flaherty, at Citi's 2011 Global Property CEO Conference, we are updating our full-year 2011 guidance as follows: we expect Funds From Operations ("FFO") applicable to common shares to range between $2.49 and $2.55 per share; FFO as adjusted applicable to common shares to range between $2.62 and $2.68 per share; Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") applicable to common shares to range between $2.05 and $2.11 per share; and net income applicable to common shares to range between $1.61 and $1.67 per share.
 
Our 2011 FFO guidance was increased by $0.04 per share to reflect the net effect of the following recent developments:
 
(i) a combined positive impact of $0.06 per share from the early repayment of our debt investments in Genesis Corporation (anticipated on or about April 1, 2011), which impact includes:
 
(a)
        
$0.09 per share related to the recognition of the remaining unamortized loan discounts and a termination fee,
(b)
        
$0.04 per share related to the anticipated benefit from the use of the $330 million of repayment proceeds, partially offset by
(c)
         
($0.07) per share related to the loss of interest from these loans;
 
(ii)   a negative impact of ($0.04) per share resulting from our March 2011 decision to place the Cirrus loan on non-accrual status of accounting as the amount and timing of payments from this loan have become less certain; and

The Company believes FFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
 
FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or "GAAP"), excluding gains or losses from real estate transactions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash
 
needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from the Company.
 
FFO as adjusted represents FFO before the impact of impairments, recoveries, merger-related items (described above) and litigation provision. Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income.
 
Funds Available for Distribution is defined as FFO as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) straight-line rents; (ii) amortization of acquired above/below market lease intangibles; (iii) amortization of debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs; (iv) amortization of stockbased compensation expense; (v) accretion and depreciation related to direct financing leases; and (vi) deferred revenues. Further, FAD is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and includes similar adjustments to compute the Company's share of FAD from its unconsolidated joint ventures. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating FAD, and accordingly, HCP's FAD may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although HCP's FAD computation may not be comparable to that of other REITs, management believes FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of the Company's ability to fund its ongoing dividend payments. In addition, management believes that in order to further understand and analyze the Company's liquidity, FAD should be compared with cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP and presented in its consolidated financial statements. FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP, and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indication of the Company's performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, or as a measure of the Company's liquidity.
