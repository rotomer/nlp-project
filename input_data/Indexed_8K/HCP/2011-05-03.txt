HCP VENTURES II ACQUISITION
 
On January 14, 2011, we acquired our partner's 65% interest in a joint venture that owns 25 senior housing facilities, becoming the sole owner of the portfolio. In connection with the closing of this acquisition, we paid approximately $136 million for the interest and assumed our partner's share of $650 million of Fannie Mae secured debt with a weighted average fixed-rate of 5.66% and weighted average maturity of 5.3 years. At closing, we valued the joint venture's assets at approximately $850 million.
 
OTHER INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
 
During the quarter ended March 31, 2011, we made additional investments of $121 million as follows: (i) acquisition of four life science facilities, representing 200,000 rentable square feet, for approximately $67 million, including assumed debt of $48 million; (ii) acquisition of a medical office building, representing 132,000 rentable square feet for approximately $32 million; and (iii) funding construction and other capital projects of $22 million, primarily in our life science and medical office segments.
 
On April 15, 2011, we purchased the Cove, the premier 20-acre parcel of land situated at the gateway of South San Francisco and adjacent to our 900,000 square foot Oyster Point campus. The land was acquired for $65 million and represents the largest undeveloped site in the city. Development activities of this site commenced in late April 2011.
 
GENESIS HEALTHCARE EARLY PAYOFF
 
On April 1, 2011, we received $330.4 million from the early repayment of our debt investments in Genesis HealthCare ("Genesis"). In conjunction with this prepayment, in the second quarter of 2011, we will recognize additional interest income of $35 million, which represents the related unamortized discount and termination fee. These debt investments were acquired in September and October 2010 for $290 million. We realized an annualized internal rate of return of 40% on these investments.
 
HCR MANORCARE ACQUISITION
 
On April 7, 2011, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of privately-owned HCR ManorCare, Inc., for a purchase price of $6.1 billion. We acquired 334 post-acute, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities located in 30 states, with the highest concentrations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois and Michigan. A wholly-owned subsidiary of HCR ManorCare will continue to operate the assets pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement supported by a guaranty from HCR ManorCare. Additionally, we exercised our option to purchase a 9.9% equity interest in the operations of HCR ManorCare for $95 million.
 
FINANCINGS
 
During the quarter ended March 31, 2011, in connection with our prefunding of the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, we completed $3.7 billion in debt and common stock offerings as follows:
 
                 
On January 24, 2011, we issued $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes as follows: (i) $400 million of 2.70% notes due 2014; (ii) $500 million of 3.75% notes due 2016; (iii) $1.2 billion of 5.375% notes due 2021; and (iv) $300 million of 6.75% notes due 2041. The notes have a weighted average maturity of 10.3 years and a weighted average yield of 4.83%. The net proceeds from the offering were $2.37 billion.
 
                 
In March 2011, we completed a $1.273 billion public offering of 34.5 million shares of common stock.
 
On March 11, 2011, we entered into a new $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the existing facility that was scheduled to mature in August 2011. Our new facility has a four-year term with a one-year committed extension option. Based on HCP's current credit ratings, the facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 150 basis points and has a facility fee of 30 basis points. We have the right to increase the commitments under the new facility by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, subject to customary conditions.
DIVIDEND
 
On April 28, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 24, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 9, 2011.
 
OUTLOOK
 
For the full year 2011, we expect FFO applicable to common shares to range between $2.47 and $2.53 per diluted share; FFO as adjusted applicable to common shares to range between $2.62 and $2.68 per diluted share; FAD applicable to common shares to range between $2.06 and $2.12 per diluted share; and net income applicable to common shares to range between $1.59 and $1.65 per diluted share.
 
Estimates of FFO and net income to common shares include the impact of the HCR ManorCare Acquisition that closed on April 7, 2011 and the corresponding merger-related items. FFO as adjusted and FAD applicable to common shares exclude the impact of merger-related items, which include: (i) direct transaction costs, net; (ii) negative carrying costs related to prefunding the HCR ManorCare Acquisition; and, partially offset by, (iii) the gain upon the reinvestment of our HCR ManorCare debt investments and other miscellaneous items. See the "Projected Future Operations" section of this report for additional information regarding the above estimates.

The Company believes FFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue.
 
FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or "GAAP"), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions and upon consolidation of joint venture, plus real estate and DFL depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from the Company.
 
FFO as adjusted represents FFO before the impact of impairments, impairment recoveries and merger-related items (defined above). Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income.

Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.
  Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges. The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company. However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges. Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
 
The following table details the calculation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage:

Cash Flow Coverage ("CFC"). 
Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM for the most recent 12 months of available data divided by the Same Period Rent. Cash Flow Coverage is a supplemental measure of a property's ability to generate cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM. The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.

Debt Service Coverage is a supplemental measure of the property's ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related obligations to the Company under loan agreements. However, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDA(R) or Facility EBITDA(R)M. The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.
 
Development.
  Includes ground-up construction and redevelopments.
 
Direct Financing Lease ("DFL").
  The Company uses the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield.
 
Estimated Completion Date.
 
For development projects, management's estimate of the date the core and shell structure improvements are expected to be or have been completed. For redevelopment projects, management's estimate of the time in which major construction activity in relation to the scope of the project has been substantially completed.
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
 The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure both its operating performance and liquidity. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from its operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, impairments, impairment recoveries, and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure the Company's operating performance independent of its capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of its operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare its operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments. The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with net income (the primary measure of the Company's performance) and the other required GAAP measures of its performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of the Company's operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of its performance between periods and as against other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity. Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
 
The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA from net income:
 
In thousands
Facility EBITDA(R) ("EBITDA(R)").
 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company), for the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date presented. The Company uses Facility EBITDA(R) in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage. Facility EBITDA(R) has limitations as an analytical tool.  Facility EBITDA(R) does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, Facility EBITDA(R) does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management. The Company utilizes Facility EBITDA(R) as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company. Facility EBITDA(R) includes the greater of (i) contractual management fees or (ii) an imputed management fee of 5% for senior housing facilities and post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and 2% for acute care hospitals which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries. All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
 
Facility EBITDA
(R)
M ("EBITDA
(R)
M").
 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company
), for the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date presented.  The Company uses Facility EBITDA(R)M in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage. Facility EBITDA(R)M has limitations as an analytical tool. Facility EBITDA(R)M does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, Facility EBITDA(R)M does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management. The Company utilizes Facility EBITDA(R)M as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company. All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
 
Financial Leverage.
 
Total Debt divided by Total Gross Assets. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. The Company believes that the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated gross assets is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Financial Leverage. The Company's computation of its Financial Leverage may not be identical to the computations of financial leverage reported by other companies. The Company's share of total debt is not intended to reflect its actual liability or ability to access assets should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.
 
Fixed Charges.
 Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends. The Company uses Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred stockholders for purposes of presenting Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage. However, the usefulness of Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
 
Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD").
  Funds Available for Distribution is defined as FFO as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) straight-line rents; (ii) amortization of acquired above/below market lease intangibles; (iii) amortization of debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs; (iv) amortization of stockbased compensation expense; (v) accretion and depreciation related to direct financing leases; and (vi) deferred revenues. Further, FAD is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and includes similar adjustments to compute the Company's share of FAD from its unconsolidated joint ventures. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating FAD, and accordingly, HCP's FAD may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although HCP's FAD computation may not be comparable to that of other REITs, management believes FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of the Company's ability to fund its ongoing dividend payments. In addition, management believes that in order to further understand and analyze the Company's liquidity, FAD should be compared with cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP and presented in its consolidated financial statements. FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company's performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company's liquidity.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO").
  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP.  FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions and upon consolidation of joint venture, plus real estate and DFL depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful.  The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate and DFL depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies.  While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future
cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
For a reconciliation of FFO to net income, please refer to the slide in this supplemental information package captioned "Consolidated Funds From Operations."
 
FFO as adjusted represents FFO before the impact of impairments, impairment recoveries and merger-related items.  Merger-related items include estimated acquisition pursuit costs that consist primarily of professional fees and the impact of common stock offering which increases the weighted average shares outstanding, when such proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration of the Company's pending acquisitions.  Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement.  This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income.
 
FFO Payout Ratio.
  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common stockholders.  FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share is subject to the same limitations noted in the definition of FFO above.

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals ("LTACHs").
  LTACHs provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require longer stays and more intensive care, monitoring or emergency back-up than that available in most skilled nursing-based programs.
 
Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI").
  A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and SPP.  The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses.  NOI excludes interest income, investment management fee income, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, impairments, impairment recoveries, other income, net, income taxes, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures and discontinued operations.  The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis.  NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL interest accretion, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. NOI, as adjusted, is sometimes referred to as "adjusted NOI" or "cash basis NOI."  The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP.  The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.  NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items.  Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
 
The following table reconciles NOI from net income:

Occupancy
.
  For life science facilities and MOBs, occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased where rental payments have commenced, including month-to-month leases, as of the end of the period reported. For senior housing facilities, post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, occupancy represents the facilities' average operating occupancy for the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date reported. The percentages are calculated based on licensed beds, available beds and units for senior housing facilities, post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, respectively. The percentages shown exclude newly completed facilities under lease-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. All facility financial performance data were derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company. For the same property portfolio, occupancy for senior housing facilities, post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are presented based on the average operating occupancy for trailing three-month period one quarter in arrears from the date reported.

.
 
Same Period Rent.
  The base rent plus additional rent due to the Company over the most recent trailing twelve-month period as of period end.  The Company uses Same Period Rent for purposes of determining property-level Cash Flow Coverage.
 
Same Property Portfolio ("SPP").
  Same property statistics allow management to evaluate the performance of the Company's leased property portfolio under a consistent population, which eliminates the changes in the composition of the Company's portfolio of properties. The Company identifies its same property portfolio as stabilized properties that are, and remained, in operations for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods presented.  Accordingly, it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations to be included in the Company's same property portfolio.  SPP NOI excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
 
Senior Housing.
  ALFs, ILFs and CCRCs.  For reporting purposes, the Company's senior housing portfolio also includes a school formerly operated as an assisted living facility.

Square Feet.
  The square footage for properties, excluding square footage for development or redevelopment properties prior to completion.
 
Stabilized.
  Newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease up (typically when the tenant(s) controls the physical use of 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. Newly completed developments, including redevelopments, are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service.
