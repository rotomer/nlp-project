or deduction, the amounts set forth hereinafter as Minimum Rent during the Term.  Payments of Minimum Rent shall be made by wire transfer of funds initiated by Lessee to Lessors account or to such other Person as Lessor from time to time may designate in writing.  For the avoidance of doubt, Lessee shall have no right to prepay all or any portion of the Rent hereunder prior to the Commencement Date.
 
           (ii) the last monthly payment of Minimum Rent shall be prorated as to any partial calendar month at the end of the Term.

Late Payment of Rent
 
LESSEE HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LATE PAYMENT BY LESSEE TO LESSOR OF RENT WILL CAUSE LESSOR TO INCUR COSTS NOT CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER, THE EXACT AMOUNT OF WHICH IS PRESENTLY ANTICIPATED TO BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN.  ACCORDINGLY,  IF ANY INSTALLMENT OF RENT OTHER THAN ADDITIONAL CHARGES PAYABLE TO A PERSON OTHER THAN LESSOR SHALL NOT BE PAID WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER ITS DUE DATE, LESSEE WILL PAY LESSOR ON DEMAND A LATE CHARGE EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF (I) THREE PERCENT (3%) OF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH INSTALLMENT OR (II) THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT PERMITTED BY LAW.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS LATE CHARGE REPRESENTS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS THAT LESSOR WILL INCUR BY REASON OF LATE PAYMENT BY LESSEE.  THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT SUCH LATE CHARGE IS RENT AND NOT INTEREST AND SUCH ASSESSMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A LENDER OR BORROWER/CREDITOR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LESSOR AND LESSEE.  IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT UNPAID, INCLUDING ANY
 
 
31
 
LATE CHARGES, SHALL BEAR INTEREST AT THE OVERDUE RATE COMPOUNDED MONTHLY FROM THE DUE DATE OF SUCH INSTALLMENT TO THE DATE OF PAYMENT THEREOF, AND LESSEE SHALL PAY SUCH INTEREST TO LESSOR ON DEMAND.  THE PAYMENT OF SUCH LATE CHARGE OR SUCH INTEREST SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE WAIVER OF, NOR EXCUSE OR CURE, ANY DEFAULT UNDER THIS LEASE, NOR PREVENT LESSOR FROM EXERCISING ANY OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO LESSOR.

Lessee shall make such payments directly to the taxing authorities where feasible, and promptly furnish to Lessor copies of official receipts or other satisfactory proof evidencing such payments.  Subject to Article XII regarding permitted contests, Lessees obligation to pay Impositions shall be absolutely fixed upon the date such Impositions become a lien upon the Leased Property, any Capital Additions or any part(s) thereof.

32
 
refund shall be paid over to or retained by Lessor and applied to the payment of Lessees obligations under this Lease in such order of priority as Lessor shall determine.

Billings for reimbursement by Lessee to Lessor of personal property or real property taxes shall be accompanied by copies of a bill therefor and payments thereof which identify the personal property or real property with respect to which such payments are made.
 
4.1.6           Lessor shall give prompt notice to Lessee of all Impositions payable by Lessee hereunder of which Lessor has knowledge (including, without limitation, those in respect of which Lessor has received written notice), but Lessors failure to give any such notice shall in no way diminish Lessees obligations hereunder to pay such Impositions.
 
4.1.7           Impositions imposed or assessed in respect of the tax-fiscal period during which the Term terminates with respect to any Facility shall be adjusted and prorated between Lessor and Lessee with respect to such Facility, whether or not such Imposition is imposed or assessed before or after such termination, and Lessees obligation to pay its prorated share thereof shall survive such termination with respect to such Facility.

In the event of a transfer of Lessors interest in the Leased Property of any Facility or an assignment of Lessors interest in this Lease with respect to any Facility, Lessor shall have the right to transfer to the transferee the amounts deposited by Lessee in any impound account established by Lessor pursuant to this Section 4.4 with respect to such Facility and thereupon shall, without any further agreement between the parties, be released by Lessee from all liability therefor, and it is agreed that the provisions hereof shall apply to every transfer or assignment of such amounts to such a transferee/assignee.  The amounts deposited by Lessee in any impound account established by Lessor pursuant to this Section 4.4 may also be assigned as security in connection with a Facility Mortgage, provided that the same shall be subject to the terms of any applicable subordination and non-disturbance agreement entered into between Lessee and the applicable Facility
 
 
34
 
Mortgagee.  Nothing contained in this Section 4.4 shall be deemed to affect any right or remedy of Lessor hereunder.
 
4.5           
Tax Service
.  During the Term, to the extent in Lessees possession, Lessee shall provide Lessor with copies of reports provided by a third party tax reporting service or consultant monitoring the timely payment of Impositions by Lessee under this Lease promptly upon Lessors request for such reports, but in no event more frequently than quarterly.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessor shall retain the right at any time during the Term, at its election and expense, to separately engage a third party tax reporting service or consultant for the purpose of monitoring the timely payment of Impositions by Lessee under this Lease and Lessee shall reasonably cooperate with Lessor and any such a third party tax reporting service or consultant engaged by Lessor.
 
 
5.1           .
No Termination, Abatement, etc
  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Lease, Lessee shall remain bound by this Lease in accordance with its terms and shall not seek or be entitled to any abatement, deduction, deferment or reduction of Rent, or set-off against the Rent.  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Lease, the respective obligations of Lessor and Lessee shall not be affected by reason of (i) any damage to or destruction of the Leased Property, any Capital Additions and/or any part(s) thereof from whatever cause and/or any Condemnation of the Leased Property, any Capital Additions and/or any part(s) thereof; (ii) the lawful or unlawful prohibition of, or restriction upon, Lessees use of the Leased Property, any Capital Additions and/or any part(s) thereof, or the interference with such use by any Person (other than Lessor in contravention of this Lease) or by reason of eviction by paramount title; (iii) any claim that Lessee has or might have against Lessor by reason of any default or breach of any warranty by Lessor hereunder or under any other agreement between Lessor and Lessee or to which Lessor and Lessee are parties (except, and then only to the extent that, Lessors actions materially and adversely impair Lessees use or operation of a Facility in contravention of this Lease); (iv) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, winding up or other proceedings affecting Lessor or any assignee or transferee of Lessor; or (v) for any other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to any of the foregoing, other than a discharge of Lessee from any such obligations as a matter of law.  Lessee hereby specifically waives all rights arising from any occurrence whatsoever which may now or hereafter be conferred upon it by law (a) to modify, surrender or terminate this Lease or quit or surrender the Leased Property, any Capital Additions and/or any part(s) thereof; or (b) which may entitle Lessee to any abatement, reduction, suspension or deferment of the Rent or other sums payable by Lessee hereunder, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Lease.  The obligations of Lessor and Lessee hereunder shall be separate and independent covenants and agreements and the Rent and all other sums payable by Lessee hereunder shall continue to be payable in all events unless the obligations to pay the same shall be terminated pursuant to the express provisions of this Lease or by termination of this Lease other than by reason of an Event of Default.
 
5.2           
Termination with Respect to Fewer than All of the Facilities
.  Wherever in this Lease the action of terminating the Lease with respect to any Facility (or action of similar
 
 
35
 
import) is discussed, such action shall mean the termination of Lessees rights in and to the Leased Property relating to such Facility.  Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, if this Lease shall be terminated by Lessor or Lessee with respect to any Facility in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Lease, such termination shall not affect the applicable Term of this Lease with respect to the balance of the Facilities not so terminated, and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect with respect to each other such Facility, except that the total Minimum Rent payable hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of Allocated Minimum Rent with respect to such Facility as to which this Lease has so terminated.  Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall serve in any way (a) to limit Lessors ability, pursuant to and solely in accordance with Section 16.2 below, to terminate this Lease with respect to any or all of the Facilities if an Event of Default shall have occurred under this Lease, regardless of whether such Event of Default emanated primarily from a single Facility, or (b) in the event of a termination because of an Event of Default, to recover damages or otherwise exercise its remedies with respect to such Facility(ies) as provided in Article XVI.
 
 
6.1           
Ownership of the Leased Property
.  Lessee acknowledges that the Leased Property is the property of Lessor and that Lessee has the right to the exclusive possession and use of the Leased Property only upon the terms and conditions of this Lease.  Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease with respect to any Facility Lessee shall, at its expense, repair and restore the Leased Property relating to such Facility to the condition required by Section 9.1.4.
 
6.2           
Personal Property
.  During the Term, Lessee shall, as necessary to operate and maintain each Facility in accordance with all material terms of this Lease, and at its expense, install, affix or assemble or place on any parcels of the Land or in any of the Leased Improvements, any items of Lessees Personal Property and replacements thereof which shall be the property of and owned by Lessee.  Except as provided in Sections 6.3 and 16.9, Lessor shall have no rights to Lessees Personal Property or Intangible Property.  With respect to each Facility, Lessee shall provide and maintain during the entire Term applicable to such Facility all Personal Property necessary in order to operate such Facility (i) in compliance with all Required Governmental Approvals, and (ii) in material compliance with all Legal Requirements and all Insurance Requirements and otherwise in accordance with customary practice in the industry for the Primary Intended Use.
 
6.3           
Transfer of Personal Property and Capital Additions to Lessor
.  Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease with respect to any Facility, all Capital Additions not owned by Lessor shall become the property of Lessor, free of any encumbrance and all or any portion of Lessees Personal Property (including motor vehicles used to transport residents/patients) relating to such Facility shall, if so elected by Lessor, become the property of Lessor, free of any encumbrance, and Lessee shall execute all documents and take any actions reasonably necessary to evidence such ownership and discharge any encumbrance thereon.  If Lessor does not so elect to acquire any portion of the Lessees Personal Property, Lessee shall remove any such items of Lessees Personal Property that Lessor has not so elected to acquire upon such expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.  Notwithstanding anything to the
 
 
36
 
contrary in this Lease, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease with respect to any Facility, Lessor shall not be obligated to reimburse Lessee for any replacements, rebuildings, alterations, additions, substitutions, and/or improvements that are surrendered as part of or with the Leased Property or Capital Additions of such Facility.
 
 
7.1           
Condition of the Leased Property
.  Lessee acknowledges receipt and delivery of possession of the Leased Property and confirms that Lessee has examined and otherwise has knowledge of the condition of the Leased Property prior to the execution and delivery of this Lease and has found the same to be in good order and repair, free from Hazardous Substances not in compliance with Legal Requirements, and satisfactory for its purposes hereunder.  Regardless, however, of any examination or inspection made by Lessee and whether or not any patent or latent defect or condition was revealed or discovered thereby, Lessee is leasing the Leased Property AS IS in its present condition.  Lessee waives any claim or action against Lessor in respect of the condition of the Leased Property including any defects or adverse conditions not discovered or otherwise known by Lessee as of the date hereof.  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, LESSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN RESPECT OF THE LEASED PROPERTY OR ANY PART THEREOF, EITHER AS TO ITS FITNESS FOR USE, DESIGN OR CONDITION FOR ANY PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE, OR AS TO THE NATURE OR QUALITY OF THE MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP THEREIN, OR THE EXISTENCE OF ANY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE, MOLD OR MOLD CONDITION, IT BEING AGREED THAT ALL SUCH RISKS, LATENT OR PATENT, ARE TO BE BORNE SOLELY BY LESSEE INCLUDING ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR ANY (I) ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND (II) MOLD REMEDIATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH ALL MOLD REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS.
 
7.2           .
Use of the Leased Property
 
7.2.1           Lessee covenants that it will obtain and maintain all Required Governmental Approvals with respect to each Facility (including for any Capital Additions to such Facility).
 
7.2.2           Lessee shall use or cause to be used the Leased Property, all Capital Additions and the improvements thereon of each Facility only for the Primary Intended Use of such Facility and for no other uses, except for areas reasonably required for office, storage space or ancillary service uses incidental to the Primary Intended Use.  No change to the Primary Intended Use of any Facility shall be permitted hereunder without the prior written consent of Lessor.  Lessors consent to any requested change to the Primary Intended Use of any Facility may be granted or withheld in its reasonable discretion as long as the proposed use is for a skilled nursing, assisted living, in-patient hospice, long-term acute care facility, post-acute rehabilitation facility, continuing care retirement community, adult day care facility, out-patient physical rehabilitation facility or clinical laboratories, but Lessor shall have a sole discretion approval right with respect to any other proposed changes in use.  Additionally, in connection
 
 
37
 
with any request for a change in the Primary Intended Use, Lessee acknowledges and agrees that Lessors withholding of its consent to any such request shall be deemed to have been reasonable if based (in whole or in part) on the fact that the contemplated change in use could (at the time of determination) reasonably be expected to materially impair the then Fair Market Value of the Facility and all Capital Additions thereto.
 
7.2.3           Subject to any reasonable interruptions in operations as a result of (i) casualty or condemnation and the restoration thereof in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 14 and/or Section 15 hereof, or (ii) the remediation of any environmental condition in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 37.3 hereof, Lessee shall operate continuously the entire Leased Property and all Capital Additions of each Facility in accordance with the Primary Intended Use of such Facility.  Lessee shall devote the entirety of each Facility and all Capital Additions thereto to the Primary Intended Use, except for areas reasonably required for office, storage space or ancillary service uses incidental to the Primary Intended Use.  Lessee shall not modify the services offered or take any other action (e.g., removing patients or residents from any Facility or directing patients or residents, or prospective patients or residents, to another facility) which would materially reduce gross revenues or the fair market value of any Facility.
 
7.2.4           Lessee shall conduct its business at each Facility in conformity with standards that meet or exceed the standards of Lessees operations as of the Commencement Date and in a manner consistent with normal and customary standards of patient or resident care practice (as the same may change from time to time during the Term) provided in similar facilities in the State.
 
7.2.5           Lessee shall not commit any physical waste on the Leased Property and/or on or to any Capital Additions.
 
7.2.6           Lessee shall not permit the Leased Property, any Capital Additions, or any part(s) thereof, or Lessees Personal Property, to be used in such a manner as (i) is reasonably likely to impair Lessors title thereto or to any portion thereof or (ii) may make reasonably likely a claim of adverse use or possession, or an implied dedication of the Leased Property, any Capital Additions or any part(s) thereof.
 
           Except with respect to the bed transfers set forth on Schedule 7.2.7, Lessee shall not voluntarily reduce the number of licensed beds for any Facility from that number set forth on , , , and attached hereto other than voluntary reductions of not more than ten percent (10%) of the number of beds set forth on , , , and attached hereto in the aggregate during the Term, provided that such voluntary reductions are (i) transfers of beds, (a) to any other Facilities covered by this Lease or (b) to any development project or new facility that is subject to a Covered Transaction or (ii) a result of the removal of beds from service at a particular Facility without reducing the number of licensed beds at such Facility and while retaining the right to return any such beds to service at the same Facility (so called bed banking).  Lessee shall provide Lessor written notice within ten (10) Business Days following the completion of
7.2.7
Exhibit A-1
Exhibit A-2
Exhibit A-3
Exhibit A-4
Exhibit A-1
Exhibit A-2

(x) each of the bed transfers set forth on Schedule 7.2.7, and (y) any other voluntary bed transfer permitted under this Section 7.2.7.
 
           set forth on , , , and (as applicable)
7.2.8
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section7.2.7 above, upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is thirty (30) days after the Commencement Date, or (ii) the effective date of the transfer of beds to the Dublin and Twinsburg facilities described on Schedule 7.2.7, Lessor shall have the right (at its election, in its sole discretion) to (a) amend the Allocated Minimum Rent
Exhibit A-1
Exhibit A-2
Exhibit A-3
Exhibit A-4
for the Rocky River, Maidera and  Mt. Airy Facilities so as to redistribute up to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) per year of the total Allocated Minimum Rent attributable to such Facilities among them on such basis and in such amounts as Lessor may determine, and/or (b) re-allocate any one or more of the Rocky River, Maidera and  Mt. Airy Facilities to other Facility pools or exchange such Facilities with Facilities in another pool.  In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 7.2.7 above,  with respect to the Centerburg, Euclid, N. Olmsted, Rocky River, Madeira, Mt Airy, and Victorian Village Facilities, additional transfers of licensed beds without Lessor's consent (which may be granted or withheld in Lessors sole discretion) shall be limited to five percent (5%) at any of such Facilities in the aggregate during the Term.
 
7.3           .
Lessor to Grant Easements, etc
  Lessor shall, from time to time so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the request of Lessee and at no cost or expense to Lessor, but subject to the approval of Lessor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (i) grant easements and other rights in the nature of easements; (ii) release existing easements or other rights in the nature of easements which are for the benefit of the Leased Property; (iii) dedicate or transfer unimproved portions of the Leased Property for road, highway or other public purposes; (iv) execute petitions to have the Leased Property annexed to any municipal corporation or utility district; (v) execute amendments to any covenants, conditions and restrictions affecting the Leased Property; and (vi) execute and deliver to any Person any instrument appropriate to confirm or effect such grants, releases, dedications and transfers to the extent of its interest in the Leased Property, but only upon delivery to Lessor of an Officers Certificate stating that such grant release, dedication, transfer, petition or amendment is reasonably necessary to for the use, maintenance and/or operation of the Leased Property and would not be reasonably expected to materially reduce the value of the Leased Property.
 
7.4           
Preservation of Facility Value
.  Lessee acknowledges that a fair return to Lessor on its investment in the Leased Property is dependent, in part, on the concentration on the Leased Property and all Capital Additions during the Term of, as applicable, the assisted living and skilled nursing businesses of the Lessee Parties in the geographical area of the Leased Property.  Lessee further acknowledges that diversion of residents and/or patients, as applicable, from any Facility to other facilities or institutions and/or reemployment by Lessee of management or supervisory personnel working at any Facility following the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease at other facilities or institutions owned, operated or managed, whether directly or indirectly, by the Lessee Parties could reasonably be expected to have a material
 
 
39
 
adverse impact on the value and utility of the Leased Property and all Capital Additions.  Accordingly, Lessor and Lessee agree as follows:
 
           this Section 7.4.1 shall not be deemed violated if (i) any Lessee Partys interest in a facility or institution located within a five (5) mile radius outward from the outside boundaries of the Land shall arise by virtue of any Lessee Partys acquisition of the operation, ownership, management or other ownership interest in a portfolio, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, comprised of a minimum of twenty-five (25) facilities or institutions of which less than twenty percent (20%) of such facilities or institutions are located within a five (5) mile radius outward from the outside boundaries of the Land or (ii) such facility is listed on attached hereto and made a part hereof.
7.4.1
Other than as set forth below, during the Term, none of the Lessee Parties, directly or indirectly, shall operate, own, manage or have any ownership interest in any other facility or institution providing services or similar goods to those provided in connection with any Facility and its Primary Intended Use, within a
 
five (5)
 
mile radius outward from the outside boundaries of the Land on which any Facility is located.  All distances shall be measured on a straight line rather than on a driving distance basis.  In the event that any portion of such other facility or institution is located within such restricted area the entire facility or institution shall be deemed located within such restricted area.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Schedule 7.4.1
 
           this Section 7.4.2 shall not be deemed violated if, in the aggregate, not more than ten percent (10%) of all such
7.4.2
During the last year of the applicable Fixed Term and any Extended Term and for a period of two (2) years following expiration of the Term, no Lessee Party shall, without the prior written consent of Lessor, which consent may be given or withheld in Lessors sole discretion, hire, engage or otherwise employ any facility level management or supervisory personnel working on or in connection with any Facility; provided, however, that
management or supervisory personnel are hired by any one or more of the Lessee Parties during the above described time periods.
 
7.4.3           Except as required for medically appropriate reasons, at any time during the last three (3) years of the applicable Fixed Term and of any Extended Terms, with respect to any or all of the Facilities, Lessee shall not, without the prior written consent of Lessor, which consent may be given or withheld in Lessors sole discretion, recommend or solicit the removal or transfer of more than three percent (3%) of the total residents or patients at any Facility to any other facility or institution (including, without limitation, any other Facility that is subject to this Lease).
 
 
8.1           
Compliance with Legal and Insurance Requirements, Instruments, etc.
  Subject to Article XII regarding permitted contests, Lessee, at no expense to Lessor, shall promptly (i) comply with all material Legal Requirements and material Insurance Requirements regarding the use, operation, maintenance, repair and restoration of the Leased Property, Lessees Personal Property and all Capital Additions whether or not compliance therewith may require structural changes in any of the Leased Improvements or any Capital Additions or interfere with the use and enjoyment of the Leased Property and (ii) procure, maintain and
 
 
40
 
comply with all Required Governmental Approvals.  At any time following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lessor may, but shall not be obligated to, enter upon the Leased Property and all Capital Additions and take such actions and incur such costs and expenses to effect such compliance as it deems advisable (exercising its commercially reasonable judgment) to protect its interest in the Leased Property and all Capital Additions, and Lessee shall reimburse Lessor for all such costs and expenses so incurred by Lessor in connection with such actions.  Lessee covenants and agrees that the Leased Property, Lessees Personal Property and all Capital Additions shall not be used for any unlawful purpose.
 
 
9.1           .
Maintenance and Repair
 
9.1.1           Lessee shall, at no expense to Lessor, maintain the Leased Property, and every portion thereof, Lessees Personal Property and all Capital Additions, and all private roadways, sidewalks and curbs appurtenant to the Leased Property, and which are under Lessees control in good order and repair (to the extent necessary to maintain continued operation of the same in a manner consistent with the standard set forth in Section 7.2.4) whether or not the need for such repairs occurs as a result of Lessees use, any prior use, the elements or the age of the Leased Property, Lessees Personal Property and all Capital Additions, and, with reasonable promptness, Lessee shall make or cause to be made all necessary and appropriate repairs thereto of every kind and nature, including those necessary to comply with changes in any material Legal Requirements, subject to Article XII regarding permitted contests, whether interior or exterior, structural or non-structural, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen or arising by reason of a condition existing prior to the Commencement Date.  All repairs shall be at least equivalent in quality to the original work.  Lessee will not take or omit to take any action the taking or omission of which could reasonably be expected to materially impair the value or the usefulness of the Leased Property, any Capital Additions, or any part(s) thereof for continued operation thereof, in a manner consistent with the standard set forth in Section 7.2.4, for the Primary Intended Use.
 
9.1.2           Lessor shall not under any circumstances be required to (i) build or rebuild any improvements on the Leased Property or any Capital Additions; (ii) make any repairs, replacements, alterations, restorations or renewals of any nature to the Leased Property, whether ordinary or extraordinary, structural or non-structural, foreseen or unforeseen, or to make any expenditure whatsoever with respect thereto; or (iii) maintain the Leased Property or any Capital Additions in any way.  Lessee hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law, the right to make repairs at the expense of Lessor pursuant to any law in effect at the time of the execution of this Lease or hereafter enacted.
 
9.1.3           Nothing contained in this Lease and no action or inaction by Lessor shall be construed as (i) constituting the consent or request of Lessor, expressed or implied, to any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, materialman or vendor to or for the performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other property for the construction, alteration, addition, repair or demolition of or to the Leased Property, any Capital Additions or any part(s) thereof; or (ii) giving Lessee any right, power or permission to contract
 
 
41
 
other than Permitted Encumbrances and inchoate mechanics liens resulting from work permitted to be done at the Leased Properties in accordance with this Lease, subject to the terms hereof with respect thereto
for or permit the performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as would permit the making of any claim against Lessor in respect thereof or to make any agreement that may create any right, title, interest, lien, claim or other encumbrance upon the estate of Lessor in the Leased Property, any Capital Additions or any part(s) thereof
.
 
9.1.4           Unless Lessor shall convey any of the Leased Property to Lessee pursuant to the provisions of this Lease, Lessee shall, upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, vacate and surrender the Leased Property, Lessees Personal Property, and all Capital Additions to Lessor in the condition in which the Leased Property was originally received from Lessor and Lessees Personal Property and any Capital Additions were originally introduced to each Facility, except as repaired, rebuilt, restored, altered or added to as permitted or required by the provisions of this Lease and except for ordinary wear and tear.
 
9.2           
Encroachments, Restrictions, Mineral Leases, etc.
  If any of the Leased Improvements or Capital Additions shall, at any time, encroach upon any property, street or right-of-way, or shall violate any restrictive covenant or other agreement affecting the Leased Property, any Capital Additions or any parts thereof, or shall impair the rights of others under any easement or right-of-way to which the Leased Property is subject, or the use of the Leased Property or any Capital Additions is impaired, limited or interfered with by reason of the exercise of the right of surface entry or any other provision of a lease or reservation of any oil, gas, water or other minerals, then promptly upon the request of Lessor or any Person affected by any such encroachment, violation or impairment, Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, but subject to its right to contest the existence of any such encroachment, violation or impairment, shall protect, indemnify, save harmless and defend Lessor from and against all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts fees and expenses) based on or arising by reason of any such encroachment, violation or impairment.  In the event of an adverse final determination with respect to any such encroachment, violation or impairment, Lessee shall either (i) obtain valid and effective waivers or settlements of all claims, liabilities and damages resulting from each such encroachment, violation or impairment, whether the same shall affect Lessor or Lessee; or (ii) make such changes in the Leased Improvements and any Capital Addition, and take such other actions, as Lessee in the good faith exercise of its judgment deems reasonably practicable, to remove such encroachment or to end such violation or impairment, including, if necessary, the alteration of any of the Leased Improvements or any Capital Addition, and in any event take all such actions as may be necessary in order to be able to continue the operation of the Leased Improvements and any Capital Addition for the Primary Intended Use substantially in the manner and to the extent the Leased Improvements and Capital Additions were operated prior to the assertion of such encroachment, violation or impairment.  Lessees obligations under this Section 9.2 shall be in addition to and shall in no way discharge or diminish any obligation of any insurer under any policy of title or other insurance and, to the extent the recovery thereof is not necessary to compensate Lessor for any damages incurred by
 
 
42
 
any such encroachment, violation or impairment, Lessee shall be entitled to a credit for any sums recovered by Lessor under any such policy of title or other insurance.
 
9.3           
Deferred Maintenance
.  During each of the tenth (10) and twentieth (20) Lease Years, Lessor shall obtain, at Lessors cost, updated property condition assessments (each a PCA) for each of the Facilities.  Based on the PCAs, Lessor shall (i) identify to Lessee items of deferred maintenance (each a Required Maintenance Project) that Lessee will be required to complete during the next two (2) Lease Years (i.e., Lease Years eleven (11) and twelve (12) and twenty one (21) and twenty two (22), as applicable), and (ii) exercising Lessors reasonable discretion, reset the Annual Minimum Project Amount.  Lessor shall provide Lessee with written notice detailing any Required Maintenance Projects and the new Annual Minimum Project Amount within a reasonable time after Lessors receipt of the PCAs for all Facilities. Any dispute regarding Lessors determination of the Required Maintenance Projects or the new Annual Minimum Project Amount shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of Section 44.1.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Lessor acknowledges and agrees that Lessee shall be entitled to expend funds constituting the Annual Minimum Project Amount to complete any Required Maintenance Projects (all of which shall be deemed Capital Projects purposes of Section 9.5 below).

O&M Plan
 
9.4.1           With respect to each Facility identified on hereto, Lessee shall institute, within ninety (90) days after the Commencement Date, an operations and maintenance plan (each a Maintenance Program) designed by an environmental consultant reasonably satisfactory to Lessor, with respect to asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), consistent with Guidelines for Controlling Asbestos-Containing Materials in Buildings (USEPA, 1985) and any other applicable Environmental Laws, and each such Maintenance Program will remain in effect throughout the Term with respect to each such Facility.  In furtherance of the foregoing, Lessee shall inspect and maintain all ACMs on a regular basis and ensure that all ACMs shall be maintained in a condition that prevents exposure of residents to ACMs at all times.  Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Lessor may require (i) periodic notices or reports to Lessor in form, substance and at such intervals as Lessor may reasonably specify, (ii) a reasonable amendment to each such Maintenance Program to address changing circumstances, laws or other matters, (iii) at Lessees sole expense (provided, that Lessee shall not be required to pay for the same more than one (1) time in any twelve (12) month period unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and is then continuing), reasonable supplemental examination of the Leased Property by consultants specified by Lessor, and (iv) reasonable variation of any such Maintenance Program in response to the reports provided by any such consultants.

Ongoing Capital Projects
.
 
9.5.1           Without in any way limiting Lessees obligations under this Article IX (including Section 9.3 hereof), Lessee shall expend during each Lease Year, no less than the Annual Minimum Capital Project Amount for Capital Projects. Such Capital Projects shall be performed and completed in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Lease. Promptly
 
 
43
 
following the expiration of each Lease Year, Lessee shall furnish to Lessor reasonable documentary evidence as to the completion of all Capital Projects for such Lease Year required pursuant to this Section 9.5, together with the costs thereof.  If Lessee fails to expend during any Lease Year the applicable Annual Minimum Capital Project Amount for Capital Projects, then Lessee shall promptly deposit with Lessor as a repair and replacement reserve (the Replacement Reserve) for Capital Projects, an amount equal to (x) the Annual Minimum Capital Project Amount less (y) the sum of (i) the amounts expended by Lessee during such Lease Year on account of Capital Projects and (ii) the Annual Minimum Capital Project Amount Overage, and, so long as Lessee otherwise maintains the Facilities in the condition required by this Lease, once such deposit has been made Lessee shall not be deemed to be in default of its obligations under this Section 9.5 for Lessees failure to expend during such Lease Year the applicable Annual Minimum Capital Project Amount for Capital Projects; provided, however, that (A) Lessee shall not be permitted to deposit into the Replacement Reserve in any one Lease Year an amount equal to more than five percent (5%) of the Annual Minimum Capital Project Amount for such Lease Year, and (B) to the extent that Lessee makes a deposit into the Replacement Reserve in any Lease Year, in the next Lease Year thereafter Lessee shall expend sufficient funds in excess of the Annual Minimum Capital Project Amount in order to permit Lessee to draw and apply the balance of such reserved funds in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.5.2.

14.2.3           If a casualty results in Insurance Proceeds in excess of the Proceeds Threshold and the cost of the repair or restoration exceeds the amount of Insurance Proceeds received by Lessor from the insurance required to be carried hereunder, Lessee shall contribute any excess amounts needed to restore such Facility.  Such difference shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor together with any other Insurance Proceeds (unless the same are not required to be paid to Lessor pursuant to Section 14.1 regarding the Proceeds Threshold), for application to the cost of repair and restoration.

56
 
destruction shall not terminate this Lease with respect to such Facility or any other Facility.

If at any time during the Term, Lessor has terminated this Lease with respect to a number of Facilities equal to seven percent (7%) or more (in the aggregate) of the number of Facilities then subject to this Lease pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 16.2, then if any additional Event(s) of Default shall occur thereafter, Lessor may terminate this Lease with respect any one or more (including all, if so elected by Lessor) of the Facilities, regardless of the cause of nature of such Event of Default, by giving Lessee notice of such termination and the Term shall terminate and all rights of Lessee under this Lease shall cease with respect to all such Facilities as to which Lessor has elected to so terminate this Lease.  Any such notice of termination may, at Lessors option, be given and exercised concurrently with any notice of Event of Default given by Lessor to Lessee hereunder.  In such event, such termination shall be effective immediately upon the occurrence of the Event of Default subject to Legal Requirements, including, without limitation, any requirement that the occupant needs to be the holder of any applicable health care licenses.  In addition to the foregoing, if any Event of Default pursuant to Section 16.1(g) or (h) shall occur, Lessor shall have the immediate right, at its election in its sole discretion, to terminate this Lease with respect any one or more (including all, if so elected by Lessor) of the Facilities.  In all such events, Lessor shall have all rights at law and in equity available to Lessor as a result of any Event of Default.  Lessee shall pay as Additional Charges all costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Lessor, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, as a result of any Event of Default hereunder.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, whether or not this Lease has been terminated with respect to any one or more (including all, if so elected by Lessor and permitted in accordance with the terms hereof) of the Facilities pursuant to this Section 16.2, Lessee shall, to the extent permitted by law, if required by Lessor so to do, immediately surrender to Lessor possession of the Leased Property and any Capital Additions of the Facilities as to which Lessor has so elected to terminate this Lease and quit the same and Lessor may enter upon and repossess such Leased Property and such Capital Additions by reasonable force,
 
 
61
 
summary proceedings, ejectment or otherwise, and may remove Lessee and all other Persons and any of Lessees Personal Property from such Leased Property and such Capital Additions.
 
16.3           
Damages
 
.  (i) The termination of this Lease with respect to any one or more of the Facilities; (ii) the repossession of the Leased Property and any Capital Additions of any Facility; (iii) the failure of Lessor, notwithstanding reasonable good faith efforts, to relet the Leased Property or any portion thereof; (iv) the reletting of all or any portion of the Leased Property; or (v) the failure or inability of Lessor to collect or receive any rentals due upon any such reletting, shall not relieve Lessee of its liabilities and obligations hereunder, all of which shall survive any such termination, repossession or reletting.  In addition, the termination of this Lease with respect to any one or more of the Facilities shall not relieve Lessee of its liabilities and obligations hereunder with respect to such terminated Facility(ies) that are intended to survive the termination of this Lease, including, without limitation, the obligations set forth in this Section 16.3 and Sections 16.5, 23.1, 37.4 and 45.1.8.  If any such termination occurs, Lessee shall forthwith pay to Lessor all Rent due and payable with respect to the Facility(ies) terminated to and including the date of such termination.  Thereafter, following any such termination, Lessee shall forthwith pay to Lessor, at Lessors option, as and for liquidated and agreed current damages for an Event of Default by Lessee, the sum of:
 
(a)           the worth at the time of award of the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination with respect to the terminated Facility(ies),
 
(b)           the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination with respect to the terminated Facility(ies) until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided,
 
(c)           the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term for the terminated Facility(ies) after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Lessee proves could be reasonably avoided, plus
 
(d)           any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by Lessees failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.
 
As used in clauses (a) and (b) above, the worth at the time of award shall be computed by allowing interest at the Overdue Rate.  As used in clause (c) above, the worth at the time of award shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus One Percent (1%).
 
Alternatively, if Lessor does not elect to terminate this Lease with respect to any Facility, then Lessee shall pay to Lessor, at Lessors option, as and for agreed damages for such Event of Default without termination of Lessees right to possession of the Leased Property and any Capital Additions or any portion thereof, each installment of said Rent and other sums payable by Lessee to Lessor under the Lease as the same becomes due and payable, together
 
 
62
 
with interest at the Overdue Rate from the date when due until paid, and Lessor may enforce, by action or otherwise, any other term or covenant of this Lease.
 
16.4           
Receiver
.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and upon commencement of proceedings to enforce the rights of Lessor hereunder, Lessor shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to the appointment of a receiver or receivers acceptable to Lessor of the Leased Property and any Capital Additions of the revenues, earnings, income, products and profits thereof, pending the outcome of such proceedings, with such powers as the court making such appointment shall confer.
 
16.5           
Lessees Obligation to Purchase
.  Upon the occurrence of a Put Event with respect to any Facility, Lessor shall be entitled to require Lessee to purchase the Leased Property of such Facility or Facilities with respect to which such Put Event emanated, if any (provided, that any Event of Default giving rise to a Put Event that relates to Lessees performance hereunder generally and is not  limited to circumstances at any specified Facility(ies), expressly including, without limitation, any Event of Default for failure to pay Minimum Rent, shall, at Lessors election in its reasonable discretion, constitute a Put Event requiring Lessee to purchase any or all of the Facilities), on the first Minimum Rent Payment Date occurring not less than thirty (30) days after the date specified in a notice from Lessor requiring such purchase for an amount equal to the greater of (i) the Fair Market Value of such Facility(ies), or (ii) the Minimum Repurchase Price of such Facility(ies), plus, in either event, all Rent then due and payable (excluding any portion of the installment of Minimum Rent equal to the Allocated Minimum Rent for such Facility(ies) due on the purchase date) with respect to such Facility(ies).  The purchase price shall also be increased by the amount of any Built-in Gains in a manner to make Lessor whole as a result of any Built-in Gains tax incurred by Lessor.  If Lessor exercises such right, Lessor shall convey the Leased Property of such Facility(ies) to Lessee on the date fixed therefor in accordance with the provisions of Article XVIII upon receipt of the purchase price therefor and this Lease shall thereupon terminate with respect to such Facility(ies).  Any purchase by Lessee of the Leased Property of a Facility pursuant to this Section shall be in lieu of the damages specified in Section 16.3 with respect to such Facility.
 
16.6           
Waiver
.  If Lessor initiates judicial proceedings or if this Lease is terminated by Lessor pursuant to this Article with respect to a Facility, Lessee waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) any right of redemption, re-entry or repossession; and (ii) the benefit of any laws now or hereafter in force exempting property from liability for rent or for debt.
 
16.7           
Application of Funds
.  Any payments received by Lessor under any of the provisions of this Lease shall be applied to Lessees obligations in the order which Lessor may determine or as may be prescribed by the laws of the applicable State(s).

Intentionally Omitted

16.9           
Grant of Security Interest
; Appointment of Collateral Agent
.  The parties intend that if an Event of Default occurs under this Lease, Lessor will control Lessees Personal Property and the Intangible Property (subject to the rights of the lender under the Working
 
 
63
 
Capital Facility) so that Lessor or its designee or nominee can operate or re-let each Facility intact for its Primary Intended Use.  Accordingly, to implement such intention, and for the purpose of securing the payment and performance obligations of Lessee hereunder, Lessor and Lessee agree as follows:
 
16.9.1           .
Grant of Security Interest
 
           This clause shall be self-operative and no further instrument of subordination shall be require
(a)
Lessee, as debtor, hereby grants to Collateral Agent, as secured party, for the benefit of Lessor, a security interest and an express contractual lien upon all of Lessees right, title and interest in and to Lessees Personal Property and any and all products, rents, proceeds and profits thereof (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding Lessees Intangible Property) in which Lessee now owns or hereafter acquires an interest or right, including any leased Lessees Personal Property (collectively, the Collateral).  This Lease constitutes a security agreement covering all such Collateral.  The security interest granted to Collateral Agent with respect to Lessees Personal Property in this Section 16.9 is intended by Lessor and Lessee to be subordinate to any security interest granted in connection with the purchase money financing or leasing of all or any portion of the Lessees Personal Property so long as the lessor or financier of such Lessees Personal Property agrees to give Lessor written notice of any default by Lessee under the terms of such lease or financing arrangement, to give Lessor a reasonable time following such notice to cure any such default and consents to Lessors written assumption of such lease or financing arrangement upon Lessors curing of any such defaults.  
d.  This security agreement and the security interest created herein shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease with respect to any or all of the Facilities.

If, in connection with obtaining financing or refinancing for the Leased Property and/or any such Capital Additions, a Facility Mortgagee or prospective Facility Mortgagee shall request reasonable modifications to this Lease as a condition to such financing or refinancing, Lessee shall not withhold or delay its consent thereto, provided that any such modifications shall not increase Lessees obligations or decrease Lessees rights under this Lease other than, in each case, to a de minimis extent.  Further, Lessee shall reasonably cooperate with Lessor in connection with Lessors efforts to encumber any Facility with a Facility Mortgage and with Lessors negotiations with any such prospective Facility Mortgagee.

Lessee acknowledges that any Facility Mortgage Documents executed by Lessor will impose certain obligations on the Borrower thereunder to comply with or cause the operator and/or lessee of the Facilities to comply with all representations, covenants and warranties contained therein relating to such Facilities and the operator and/or lessee of such Facilities, including, covenants relating to (a) the maintenance and repair of the Facilities, (b) maintenance and submission of financial records and accounts of the operation of each Facility and related financial and other information regarding the operator and/or lessee of such Facilities and the Facilities themselves, (c) the procurement of insurance policies with respect to the Facilities and (d) without limiting the foregoing, compliance with all Legal Requirements relating to the Facilities and the operation thereof for their Primary Intended Use.  For so long as any Facility Mortgages encumber the Leased Property, or any portion thereof, Lessee covenants and agrees (x) that it shall provide copies of any notice of any claimed breach or default by Lessor hereunder to any Facility Mortgagee for which Lessee has been provided a notice address and any such Facility Mortgage shall have the right, at its election in accordance with the terms of the applicable Facility Mortgage Documents, to cure any such claimed breach or default of Lessor hereunder on the same terms as if Lessor had performed such cure on its own behalf and Lessee shall recognize and accept any such performance by a Facility Mortgagee, and (y) at its sole cost and expense and for the express benefit of Lessor, to operate the Facilities in strict compliance with the terms and conditions of the Facility Mortgage Documents (other than payment of any indebtedness evidenced or secured thereby) and to timely perform all of the obligations of Lessor relating thereto, or to the extent that any of such duties and obligations may not properly be performed by Lessee or extend beyond the obligations imposed on Lessee under this Lease (other than to a de minimis extent), Lessee shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Lessor in the performance thereof (other than payment of any indebtedness evidenced or secured thereby); provided, however, that the duties and obligations imposed upon Lessee by the Facility Mortgage Documents relating thereto and this Section 36.3  shall not be more burdensome (other than to a de minimis extent) to Lessee than Lessees obligations to Lessor under this Lease and shall not adversely affect Lessees rights under this Lease other than to a de minimis extent (provided, that, Lessee acknowledges and agrees that commercially reasonable and customary mortgagee rights and protections relating to notices, cure periods and similar lender protections granted to any Facility Mortgagee pursuant to a subordination and non-disturbance agreement shall be deemed not to have any such prohibited effect on Lessees rights or obligations under this Lease).
 
36.3.2           Without limiting Lessees obligations pursuant to any other provision of this Section 36.3, during the Term of this Lease, Lessee acknowledges and agrees
 
 
87

During the Term of this Lease and provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing hereunder, Lessee shall, subject to the terms and conditions of such Facility Mortgage Reserve Account and the requirements of the Facility Mortgagee(s) thereunder, have access to and the right to apply or use (including for reimbursement) to the same extent of Lessor all monies held in each such Facility Mortgage Reserve Account for the purposes and subject to the limitations for which such Facility Mortgage Reserve Account is maintained, and Lessor agrees to reasonably cooperate with Lessee in connection therewith.
 
36.4           
Superior Leases

Lessee acknowledges that it shall have no interest in the Leased Property of any Facility subject to a Superior Lease, and that Lessor has no ability to grant or convey any interest therein, beyond the interest granted to Lessor as the tenant/lessee under such Superior Lease.  This Lease shall be subject and subordinate in all respect to each Superior Lease now in effect. At any Superior Lessors request, Lessee shall attorn to such Superior Lessor, or any successor-in-interest to such Superior Lessor.  This clause shall be self-operative and no further instrument of subordination shall be required; provided that upon the request of Lessee, Lessor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Superior Lessor to deliver to Lessee a non-disturbance agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lessee and such Superior Lessor.  Lessee acknowledges that any Superior Lease imposes certain obligations on the tenant or lessee thereunder to comply with or cause the operator and/or sublessee of the Facilities to comply with all representations, covenants and warranties contained therein relating to such Facilities and the operator and/or sublessee of such Facilities, including, covenants relating to (a) the maintenance and repair of the Facilities, (b) maintenance and submission of financial records and accounts of the operation of each Facility and related financial and other information regarding the operator and/or lessee of such Facilities and the Facilities themselves, (c) the procurement of insurance
 
 
88
 
policies with respect to the Facilities, and (d) without limiting the foregoing, compliance with all Legal Requirements relating to the Facilities and the operation thereof for their Primary Intended Use.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Lessees liability for Environmental Costs to the extent arising from the acts of third parties unrelated to the Lessee Parties shall be limited to a period of two (2) years following the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, but only to the extent that Lessee did not have knowledge of (nor should it reasonably have been expected to have knowledge of) the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to such Environmental Costs at any time during the Term.

The purchase price will be increased by the amount of any Built-in Gains in a manner to make Lessor whole as a result of any Built-in Gains tax incurred by Lessor.

Lessor shall have the right to enter and inspect the Leased Property (or any portion thereof) and all Capital Additions, conduct any reasonable testing, sampling and analyses it deems necessary in a manner and time that does not unreasonably interfere with the Primary Intended Use and shall have the right to inspect materials brought into the Leased Property (or any portion thereof) or any such Capital Additions.  Lessor may, in its discretion, retain such experts to conduct the inspection, perform the tests referred to herein, and to prepare a written report in connection therewith.  All costs and expenses incurred by Lessor under this Section shall be paid by Lessor; provided, however, that following the occurrence and during the
 
 
92
 
continuance of any Event of Default, Lessee shall pay all such costs and expenses on demand by Lessor as Additional Charges hereunder.  Failure to conduct an inspection or to detect unfavorable conditions if such inspection is conducted shall in no fashion be intended as a release of any liability for conditions subsequently determined to be associated with or to have occurred during Lessees tenancy.  Pursuant to the terms set forth herein, Lessee shall remain liable for any environmental condition, Mold or Mold Condition related to or having occurred during or prior to its tenancy regardless of when such conditions are discovered and regardless of whether or not Lessor conducts an inspection at the termination of this Lease, except to the extent expressly limited in Section 37.4.  The obligations set forth in this Article shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease, except to the extent expressly limited in Section 37.4 and to the extent related to acts or omissions of other Persons (that are not any of the Lessee Parties or any of their respective Affiliates) after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term.

Lessee shall pay all reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses of recording any memoranda, quitclaim deeds and other recordable instruments recorded pursuant to this Section.

If Lessee exercises the right or has the obligation to purchase the Leased Property or any portion thereof pursuant to the terms herein, and if Lessor determines not to sell such Leased Property or any portion thereof pursuant to the above sentence, then Lessee shall purchase such Leased Property or any portion thereof, upon and subject to all applicable terms and conditions
 
 
93
 
set forth in this Lease, at such time as the transaction, upon the advice of Lessors counsel, would be a sale of property (to the extent the Leased Property is a real estate asset) described in Section 857(b)(6)(C), or functionally equivalent successor provision, of the Code, and would not result in an unacceptable amount of gross income for purposes of the Ninety-Five Percent (95%) gross income test contained in Section 856(c)(2), or functionally equivalent successor provision of the Code and until such time Lessee shall lease the Leased Property and all Capital Additions from Lessor at the Fair Market Rental.

Severability

It is specifically agreed that no constituent partner in Lessor or officer, director or employee of Lessor shall ever be personally liable for any such judgment or for the payment of any monetary obligation to Lessee.  The provision contained in the foregoing sentence is not intended to, and shall not, limit any right that Lessee might otherwise have to obtain injunctive relief against Lessor, or any action not involving the personal liability of Lessor.

Lessee shall not commit any act that would jeopardize the Required Governmental Approvals for such Facility, and Lessee shall reasonably comply with all requests for an orderly transfer of the same upon the expiration or early termination of the Term applicable to such Facility.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following shall apply:
 
(a)           If requested by Lessor or a proposed replacement operator for such Facility, Lessee hereby agrees to enter into a reasonable operations transfer agreement (which shall provide for Lessor or such Successor Operators reimbursement of Lessees reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in performing its obligations under any such transfer agreement) with Lessor or such Successor Operator as is customary in the transfer to a successor operator of the operations of a facility similar to such Facility; provided that the term of any such operations transfer agreement shall not exceed a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of this Lease.  Lessee shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent to entering into any interim subleases or management agreements as may be necessary to effectuate an early transfer of the operations of such Facility prior to the time that Lessor or such Successor Operator holds all Required Governmental Approvals.
 
(b)           If requested by Lessor, Lessee shall, subject to compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, continue to manage one or more Facilities after the termination of this Lease and for so long thereafter as is necessary for Lessor or such Successor Operator to obtain all Required Governmental Approvals (provided that the term of any such continued management shall not exceed a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of this Lease), on such reasonable terms (which shall include an agreement to pay a commercially reasonable fee and to reimburse Lessee for its reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses and reasonable and administrative costs) as Lessor shall request.

Force Majeure
 
 
100
 
reasonable substitutes for such labor or materials, act of God, governmental restrictions, regulations or controls, enemy or hostile government action, civil commotion, riot or insurrection, fire or other casualty or other events similar or dissimilar to those enumerated in this paragraph beyond Lessees reasonable control, then such failure to perform shall be excused and shall not be deemed a breach of this Lease and the time for Lessee to perform such term, covenant or condition shall be extended by an amount of time equal to the delay caused by the event(s) described in this Section 45.1.6, but in no event shall any the time for performance of any such required term, covenant or condition be extended by more than sixty (60) days in the aggregate.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessor and Lessee acknowledge and agree that this Lease itself will be a publicly filed document; provided, however,  no schedules and/or exhibits hereto shall be publicly filed unless Lessor receives advice of counsel that filing is necessary to comply with applicable Legal Requirements.  In connection with any disclosures made pursuant to item (a) above, Lessor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidentiality agreements from any parties to whom it discloses financial information or other sensitive business information regarding Lessee.

If Lessor elects to remove and dispose of any such items abandoned by Lessee, the cost of such removal and disposal shall be an Additional Charge payable by Lessee to Lessor upon demand.
 
(b)           Without limiting the provisions of Section 45.1.1 above, upon any such termination or expiration of this Lease with respect to a Facility, the following shall pertain:

(ii)           Lessee shall remain liable for the cost of all utilities used in or at the Leased Property and any Capital Additions relating to such Facility through the termination date and accrued and unpaid, whether or not then billed, as of the termination date until full payment thereof by Lessee.

If any utility statement with respect to such Leased Property and any Capital Additions includes charges for a period partially prior to and partially subsequent to the termination date, such charges shall be prorated as between Lessor and Lessee, with Lessee responsible for the portion thereof (based upon a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days of service on such statement through the termination date and the denominator of which is the total number of days of service on such statement) through the termination date and Lessor shall be responsible for the balance.  The party receiving any such statement which requires proration hereunder shall promptly pay such statement and the other party shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of a copy of such statement, remit to the party paying the statement any amount for which such other party is responsible hereunder.
 
(iii)           Lessee shall remain responsible for any and all Impositions imposed against the Leased Property, the Personal Property and any Capital Additions with a lien date prior to the termination date (irrespective of the date of billing therefor) and for its pro rata share of any Impositions imposed in respect of the tax-fiscal period during which the Term terminates as provided in Section 4.1.7, and Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless with respect to any claims for such Impositions or resulting from nonpayment thereof.
 
(iv)           Lessee shall (y) execute all documents and take any actions reasonably necessary to (1) cause the transfer to Lessor of any of Lessees Personal Property that Lessor has elected to acquire and any Capital Additions not owned by Lessor, as provided in Section 6.3, in each case free of any encumbrance, as provided in
 
 
102
 
such Section 6.3 and (2) remove this Lease and/or any memorandum hereof as a matter affecting title to the Leased Property as provided in Article XXXVIII and (z) comply with its covenants set forth in Section 45.1.4.

With respect to any Leased Property located in the State of Texas, Lessor and Lessee each acknowledge, on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors and assigns, that the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act, subchapter E of Chapter 17 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code (DPTA), as amended, is not applicable to this Lease.  Accordingly, the rights and remedies of Lessor and Lessee with respect to all acts or practices of the other, past, present, or future, in connection with this Lease shall be governed by legal principles other than the DPTA.  Lessor and Lessee each hereby waive its rights under the DPTA, a law that gives consumers special rights and protections.  After consultation with an attorney of its own selection, Lessor and Lessee respectively, voluntarily consent to this waiver.
 
47.5           
Washington State Law Provisions
.  With respect only to the Leased Property located in the State of Washington, Lessor and Lessee hereby agree as follows:
 
47.5.1           .  Solely for the purpose of effectuating Lessees indemnification obligations under this Lease, and not for the benefit of any third parties (including but not limited to employees of Lessee), Lessee specifically and expressly waives any immunity that may be granted it under the Washington State Industrial Insurance Act, Title 51 RCW.  Furthermore, the indemnification obligations under this Lease shall not be limited in any way by any limitation on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable to or for any third party under Worker Compensation Acts, Disability Benefit Acts or other employee benefit acts now or hereafter in effect in the State of Washington.  The parties acknowledge that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph have been specifically and mutually negotiated between the parties.
Waiver of Workers Compensation Immunity
 
47.5.2           .  Should Lessor reenter any Facility under any provisions of this Lease relating to an Event of Default by Lessee hereunder,  Lessor shall not be deemed to have terminated this Lease, or the liability of Lessee to pay the Rent thereafter accruing, or to have terminated Lessees liability for damages under any of the provisions of this Lease, by any such reentry or by any action, in unlawful detainer or otherwise, to obtain possession of such Facility, unless Lessor shall have notified Lessee in writing that Lessor had elected to terminate this Lease.  Lessee further covenants that the service by Lessor of any notice pursuant to the unlawful detainer statutes of the State of Washington and/or the surrender of possession pursuant to such notice shall not (unless Lessor elects to the contrary at the time of or at any time subsequent to the serving of such notices and such election is evidenced by a written notice to Lessee) be deemed to be a termination of this Lease.
Reentry of Premises
 
47.5.3           .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Lease, Lessee shall have no right or authority to cause or allow the Facility or the Lessors estate or interest therein or in and to this Lease to be subjected to any such lien.
No Authority to Cause Liens
 
47.6           
Performance of Lessees Obligations
.  Lessor hereby acknowledges and agrees that Lessee may, in each case, to the extent permitted by and undertaken in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, satisfy its obligation to perform any term or provision of this Lease (including the items with respect to which representations and warranties are made) by
 
 
107
 
causing any Permitted Subtenant to perform the same in accordance with all requirements of this Lease on Lessees behalf; provided, that nothing in the foregoing is intended (nor shall it be deemed or construed) to relieve Lessee of the continuing obligation to timely pay and/or perform each of its obligations and agreements hereunder and to comply with all requirements hereof and Lessee shall remain fully liable in all respects for the performance of its obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
47.7           
Right of First Refusal
.
 
(a)           If at any time during the Term, Guarantor, Tenant or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries (each a Covered Party and collectively, the Covered Parties), desires to finance (whether the same is acquisition financing, refinancing or development financing and including, without limitation, through any sale-leaseback or similar transaction) or to sell all or any portion of its interest in any assisted living facility or skilled nursing facility asset owned or currently leased by a Covered Party or otherwise identified on Schedule 47.7 hereto as being included in any Covered Partys current development pipeline, other than through a sale or Transfer to an Affiliate (any transaction of the types described in the foregoing (i) and (ii) is referred to herein as a Covered Transaction) then HCP (directly or through any of its Affiliates) shall have a right of first refusal with respect to any such Covered Transaction.  Prior to closing any Covered Transaction (and in compliance with the time periods set forth below), the applicable Covered Party shall first give written notice (a "ROFR Notice") of such Covered Transaction to HCP and shall include with such notice, true, complete and correct copies of each of the material documents and agreements evidencing or effectuating the material terms of such Covered Transaction, in each case, fully-executed by all parties thereto (such documents and agreements, collectively, the ROFR Transaction Documents).  The other party(ies) (in their capacities as buyers or lenders, as applicable) to the ROFR Transaction Documents with the Covered Parties are referred to herein as the Counter-Parties.
 
(b)           For a period of thirty (30) days after a ROFR Notice is delivered to HCP (such period, the ROFR Response Period), HCP (or its designee) shall have the right to elect to participate in the subject Covered Transaction on all the same material terms and conditions set forth in ROFR Transaction Documents and applicable to Counter-Parties thereto, by delivering written notice (an Acceptance Notice) of such election to the applicable Covered Parties.  In such event, HCP and the Covered Parties shall reasonably cooperate to promptly (i) effectuate the assignment to, and assumption by, HCP (or its designee) of the rights and obligation of the Counter-Parties under the ROFR Transaction Documents, or (ii) cause the termination of the ROFR Transaction Documents and enter into replacement documents to effectuate the subject Covered Transaction on all the same material terms and conditions set forth in the applicable ROFR Transaction Documents.
 
(c)           If HCP (i) elects not to participate in the Covered Transaction referenced in any ROFR Notice or fails to deliver an Acceptance Notice within the ROFR Response Period (in which case HCP will be deemed to have elected not to participate in the subject Covered Transaction), or (ii) timely delivers an Acceptance Notice with respect to a Covered Transaction, but then fails to close such Covered Transaction on or before the date that is ninety (90) days (such date, the Outside ROFR Closing Date) after the Acceptance Notice is
 
 
108
 
delivered to the Covered Parties, then the applicable Covered Parties may proceed to close such Covered Transaction with the applicable Counter-Parties and in accordance with the unmodified terms of the applicable ROFR Transaction Documents.
 
(d)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (including, without limitation, pursuant to paragraph (c) above), if any of the events described in (c)(i) or (c)(ii) above occurs and, thereafter, the Covered Parties (i) fail (for any reason or no reason) to close such Covered Transaction with the applicable Counter-Parties in accordance with the unmodified terms of the applicable ROFR Transaction Documents within one hundred eighty (180) days following the end of the applicable ROFR Response Period (or, in the case of a failed closing as described in (c)(ii) above, within one hundred eighty (180) days following the Outside ROFR Closing Date) or (ii) at any time after the applicable ROFR Response Period has lapsed, desire to enter into any Material Amendment with respect to any of the applicable ROFR Transaction Documents, then prior to consummating such Covered Transaction, the Covered Parties shall again offer the opportunity to participate in such Covered Transaction to HCP by sending a new ROFR Notice with respect thereto (which new ROFR Notice shall include any Material Amendment to the subject ROFR Transaction Documents) to HCP and again following the procedures set forth in this Section 47.7.
 
As used herein, Material Amendment means (i) any change in the purchase price by more than five percent (5.00%) or any material change in the interest rate or amount of the subject financing (as applicable), (ii) any change in the identity of the Counter-Parties to any ROFR Transaction Documents (other than as a result of an assignment thereof to an Affiliate of an original Counter-Party thereto or an otherwise permitted assignee under the ROFR Transaction Documents), (iii) any change in the identity of the property or other assets or interests that are subject to or bound by the terms of any ROFR Transaction Documents, or (iv) any other change, amendment, modification, supplement to, or termination of, any terms or provision of the ROFR Transaction Documents (or the entry into any new or additional document or agreement that would constitute a ROFR Transaction Document) that, taken as a whole, results in material economic and business terms of the Covered Transaction that are materially more favorable to the Counter-Parties than the terms first disclosed to HCP in the ROFR Transaction Documents delivered with the initial ROFR Notice in connection with such Covered Transaction.

Exhibit A
 
In further of the foregoing, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound hereby, Guarantor agrees as follows:
 
1.        All initially capitalized terms used in this Guaranty and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Lease.
 
2.        Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Owner:
 
(a)       the payment when due of all costs, expenses, fees, rents and other sums payable by Lessee under the Lease and the full, faithful and prompt performance when due of each and every one of the terms, conditions and covenants to be kept and performed by Lessee, as applicable, under the Lease, including, without limitation, (i) any and all indemnification and insurance obligations, (ii) all obligations to operate, repurchase, rebuild, restore or replace the Leased Property or any facilities or improvements now or hereafter constituting a portion of the Leased Property, (iii) all obligations of the Lessee under the Lease resulting from the exercise of any renewal or extension option under the Lease, and (iv) all obligations of the Lessee to purchase all or any portion of the Leased Property upon exercise of any rights, remedies or options of Owner or Lessee under the Lease; and

4.        At all times while all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding and unsatisfied, Guarantor covenants and agrees as follows for the benefit of Owner:
 
[***]
 
5.        Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably indemnifies, protects and agrees to defend (with counsel reasonably approved by Owner) and hold harmless Owner from and against any and all loss, cost, damage, liability or expense of every kind and nature whatsoever, (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, costs and disbursements) arising from the breach or violation of any representation, warranty or covenant of Guarantor hereunder.
 
6.

Obligations; release, substitute or add any one or more guarantors, lessees or sublessees (including by consent to sublease or otherwise); accept additional or substituted security for any Guaranteed Obligation; or release or subordinate any security for any Guaranteed Obligation.  No exercise or non-exercise by Owner of any right hereby given Owner, no neglect or delay in connection with exercising any such right, no dealing by Owner with Lessee, any other guarantor or any other Person (as defined in the Lease), and no change, impairment, release or suspension of any right or remedy of Owner against any Person, including Lessee and any other guarantor or other Person, shall in any way affect any of the obligations of Guarantor hereunder or any security furnished by Guarantor or give Guarantor any recourse or right of offset against Owner.  If Owner has exculpated Lessee or any other party from time to time obligated under the Lease from liability in whole or in part and/or agreed to look solely to the Leased Property, any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other asset for the satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations, such exculpation and/or agreement shall not affect the obligations of Guarantor hereunder, it being understood that Guarantors obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of Lessee, any other guarantor and any other party from time to time obligated under the Lease, and are to be construed as if no such exculpation or agreement had been given to Lessee, any other guarantor or any other party.  It is further understood and agreed that if any such exculpation or agreement has been or at any time hereafter is given to Lessee, any other guarantor or any other party from time to time obligated under the Lease, Owner has done or will do so in reliance upon the agreement of Guarantor expressed herein.
 
7.        In addition to and without derogation of or limitation on any liens and rights of set-off given to Owner by law against any property of Lessee, Guarantor and any other guarantor or other Person, Owner shall have a general lien on and security interest in and a right of set-off against all property of Guarantor now or hereafter in the possession of or under the control of Owner, whether held in a general or special account, on deposit, held for safekeeping or otherwise in the possession of or under the control of Owner.  Each such lien, security interest and right of set-off may be enforced or exercised without demand upon or notice to Guarantor, shall continue in full force unless specifically waived or released by Owner in writing and shall not be deemed waived by any conduct of Owner, by any failure of Owner to exercise any such right of set-off or to enforce any such lien or security interest or by any neglect or delay in so doing.
 
8.        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and remedies now or hereafter accorded by applicable law to sureties and/or guarantors or any other accommodation parties, under any statutory provision, common law or any other provision of law, custom or practice, and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies (other than the defense, subject to the terms of Section 24 hereof,  that any Guaranteed Obligations have actually been paid or performed), including, without limitation, (a) any right to require Owner to proceed against Lessee, any other guarantor or any other Person or to proceed against or exhaust any security held by Owner at any time or to pursue any other remedy in Owners power before proceeding against Guarantor; (b) any defense based upon any lack of authority of the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of Lessee or any other Person, or any defect in the formation of Lessee or any other Person; (c) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority, insolvency, bankruptcy, death or disability of any other guarantor or other Person or the failure of Owner to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other

proceeding) of any other guarantor or other Person; (d) notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional indebtedness or obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of Lessee or any other party from time to time obligated under the Lease, or any creditor thereof, or on the part of any other guarantor or other Person under any other instrument in connection with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness held by Owner or in connection with any Guaranteed Obligation; (e) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Owner which destroys or otherwise impairs any subrogation rights of Guarantor or any right of Guarantor to proceed against Lessee or any other party from time to time obligated under the Lease for reimbursement, or both; (f) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (g) any duty on the part of Owner to disclose to Guarantor any facts Owner may now or hereafter know about Lessee or any other party to a Document, regardless of whether Owner has reason to believe that any such fact materially increases the risk beyond that which Guarantor intends to assume or has reason to believe that any such fact is unknown to Guarantor or has a reasonable opportunity to communicate such fact to Guarantor, it being understood and agreed that Guarantor is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of Lessee and any other party from time to time obligated under the Lease and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of non-payment or non-performance of any Guaranteed Obligation; (h) any defense arising because of Owners election, in any proceeding instituted under the federal Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the federal Bankruptcy Code; (i) any defense based upon the validity or enforceability of, or (subject to Section 23 hereof) change in, this Guaranty, or the Lease; (j) any defense or rights arising under any appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshaling of assets, redemption or similar law or requirement, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (k) diligence, presentment and demand; (l) any requirement to mitigate any damages resulting from any default under the Lease; and (m) any defense based on any borrowing or grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision hereof, Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all benefits which might otherwise be available to Guarantor as a defense against the payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations under the laws of each state in which any of the Leased Property is located, in each instance to the extent such laws, or any one of them, are applicable to this Guaranty, the Lease or any of the Guaranteed Obligations except, subject to the terms of Section 24 hereof,  to the extent that any Guaranteed Obligations have actually been paid or performed.
 
9.        Until all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been satisfied and discharged in full, Guarantor shall not exercise its right of subrogation and Guarantor hereby waives any right to enforce any remedy which Owner now has or may hereafter have against Lessee, any other guarantor or any other party to a Document and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or other assets now or hereafter held by Owner with respect to the Lease.
 
10.      All existing and future indebtedness and other obligations to Guarantor of Lessee and any other party from time to time obligated under the Lease and the right of Guarantor to withdraw any capital invested by Guarantor in Lessee is hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations.  From and after the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of Default under the Lease, no portion of such subordinated indebtedness or capital shall
 
 
 
E-5
 
be paid or withdrawn, nor will Guarantor accept any payment of or on account of any such indebtedness or as a withdrawal of capital, without the prior written consent of Owner.  At Owners request, Guarantor shall cause Lessee or such other party to pay to Owner all or any part of such subordinated indebtedness or capital which Guarantor is entitled to withdraw for application by Owner to the Guaranteed Obligations.  Any payment of such subordinated indebtedness and any capital which Guarantor is entitled to withdraw which is received by Guarantor after receipt of the above-referenced request shall be received by Guarantor in trust for Owner, and Guarantor shall cause the same to be paid immediately to Owner on account of the Guaranteed Obligations.  No such payment shall reduce or affect in any manner the liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty.
 
11.      Guarantor shall file in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law all claims which Guarantor may have against Lessee or any other party from time to time obligated under the Lease or relating to any indebtedness or obligations of Lessee (or any other party from time to time obligated under the Lease) to Guarantor and will assign to Owner all rights of Guarantor thereunder.  If Guarantor does not file any such claim, following prior written notice to Guarantor, Owner, as attorney-in-fact for Guarantor, is hereby authorized to do so in the name of Guarantor or, in Owners discretion, to assign the claim to a nominee and to cause a proof of claim to be filed in the name of Owners nominee.  The foregoing power of attorney is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.  Owner or its nominee shall have the sole right to accept or reject any plan proposed in any such proceeding and to take any other action which a party filing a claim is entitled to do.  In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the Person or Persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to Owner the amount payable on such claim and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, Guarantor hereby assigns to Owner all of Guarantors rights to any such payments or distributions to which Guarantor would otherwise be entitled; , , that Guarantors obligations hereunder shall not be satisfied except to the extent that Owner receives cash in full or property acceptable to Owner by reason of such payment or distribution.  If Owner receives anything under this Guaranty other than cash in full or property acceptable to Owner, the same shall be held as collateral for amounts due under this Guaranty.

Permitted Affiliate Transaction
 
. Lessee and Sublessee hereby agree for the benefit of Lessor as follows:
2.        
Sublease Matters
 
(a)       Relationships of the Parties. Notwithstanding the effectiveness of any Sublease, Lessee is and shall hereafter remain primarily liable to Lessor, as principal and not as surety, for the prompt payment of Rent and for the prompt performance and observance of all of the covenants, conditions, duties, obligations and liabilities of the lessee under the Lease. Except as expressly provided in Section 2(b) and (c) below, nothing contained herein, in the Lease or in any Sublease shall be deemed or construed to (i) constitute Sublessee as a tenant of Lessor, irrespective of any direct interaction, oral or written, between Lessor and Sublessee relative to any Sublease, this Agreement or any Subleased Premises, or (ii) bind Lessor to any of the terms, conditions or covenants of any Sublease, or any other documents, instruments or understandings between Sublessee and Lessee, including, without limitation, those relating to any Sublease or any Subleased Premises.
 
 
(b)       Subordination to Lease. Each Sublease (and the rights of Sublessee thereunder, including, without limitation, any options to extend granted therein) and any other documents, instruments or understandings between Lessee and Sublessee relative to any Sublease, any Subleased Premises and/or the operation thereof, shall be subject and subordinate to all of the terms and conditions of the Lease, including, without limitation, those governing proposed improvements, alterations, insurance, casualty and Condemnation. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) bind Lessor to any of the terms, conditions or covenants of any Sublease or (ii) be deemed Lessor's consent or agreement to any change or modification to the Lease. Each of Lessee and Sublessee acknowledges that (A) it has reviewed the Lease, (B) certain provisions of the Subleases are or may be in conflict with provisions of the Lease and that in the event of any conflict, as between Lessor and the other parties hereto, the terms of the Lease shall control, and (C) neither Lessor's acknowledgement to any Sublease nor this Agreement constitutes Lessor's acceptance of any modification of the Lease. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute an express or implied waiver by Lessor of any rights or benefits that it is entitled to under the Lease. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing, each of Lessee and Sublessee further acknowledges and agrees that, except as provided in Section 2(c) below, Sublessee shall not have any right to
 
H-1 - 2
 
 
 
 
occupy or otherwise use any Subleased Premises following the expiration of the Term of the Lease or any earlier termination of the Lease with respect to such Subleased Premises, including, without limitation, any termination by reason of (w) an Event of Default, (x) any damage or destruction, (y) a Condemnation, or (z) the mutual termination thereof by Lessee and Lessor.
 
(c)       Termination and Attornment. Each Sublease shall at all times be terminable by Lessor upon the expiration or any earlier termination of the Lease with respect to the applicable Subleased Premises, including, without limitation, any  termination by reason of (i) an Event of Default, (ii) any damage or destruction, (iii) a Condemnation, or (iv) the mutual termination thereof by Lessee and Lessor. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease with respect to any Subleased Premises for any reason prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable Sublease, at Lessor's option (exercised in its sole and absolute discretion), Sublessee shall (A)(1) waive any right Sublessee may have to terminate such Sublease or to surrender possession of such Subleased Premises as a result of the termination of the Lease and (2) attorn to Lessor and thereafter immediately occupy such Subleased Premises, as Lessee, pursuant to the terms, conditions and provisions of the Lease, (B) enter into a new sublease with respect to such Subleased Premises under the same terms and conditions as the Sublease for such Subleased Premises (which shall remain at all times subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) with a new lessee of such Subleased Premises as may be selected by Lessor or (C) immediately surrender possession of such Subleased Premises to Lessor. In the event that Lessor requires Sublessee to attorn to Lessor as provided in clause (A) above, Lessor shall not be liable for any prior acts, duties or responsibilities of Lessee, as sublessor, under the applicable Sublease or under any other document, instrument or understanding between Lessee and Sublessee.
 
(d)       Payment of Rent Directly to Lessor. In the event that Sublessee receives written notice from Lessor or Lessor's assignee, if any, stating that (a) Lessee is in default under the Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure period provided for therein (notwithstanding that transmittal of any such notice of default may be barred by the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law), and (b) Lessor or its assignee, as the case may be, is entitled to receive the rentals and other amounts owing to Lessor under the Lease, Sublessee shall thereafter pay all rents and other amounts owing to Lessee under the Subleases directly to Lessor or Lessor's assignee, as the case may be. In such event, it is expressly understood and agreed among Lessor, Lessee and Sublessee that: (i) Sublessee shall have no responsibility or obligation to ascertain whether Lessor is entitled to make such demand; (ii) Lessee hereby authorizes Sublessee to accept such direction from Lessor and waives any right, claim or demand it may have against Sublessee by reason of any such payment to Lessor; and (iii) any such payment by Sublessee to Lessor shall discharge the obligations of Sublessee to make such payment to Lessee. All such rentals received by Lessor or its assignee from Sublessee shall be held for the account of and be credited when due against the amounts owing by Lessee under the Lease.
 
H-1 - 3
 
 
 
 
(e)       Reporting.  To the extent applicable, Sublessee hereby agrees that throughout the term of each Sublease, Sublessee shall furnish financial and other information and statements concerning Sublessee and the Subleased Premises consistent with the information required to be furnished by Lessee under the Lease, including Article XXV thereof and within the time periods provided in the Lease.
 
(f)       Performance by Sublessee. During the term of each Sublease, Sublessee agrees for the benefit of Lessor that Sublessee shall fully and timely perform and observe all of the covenants, duties and obligations of Lessee under the Lease with respect to the Subleased Premises  and in each case subject to the rights and remedies available to Lessee thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sublessee expressly agrees as follows:
 
(i)       Sublessee agrees for the benefit of Lessor that Sublessee shall fully perform and observe all of the covenants, duties and obligations of Lessee under Section 7.4 of the Lease with respect to the Subleased Premises; and
 
(ii)       Except as otherwise provided in Section 2(c) above, upon the expiration or earlier termination of any Sublease by reason of a termination of the Lease for any reason, Sublessee agrees for the benefit of Lessor that Sublessee shall fully perform and observe all of the covenants, duties and obligations of Lessee under the Lease with respect to the Subleased Premises relating to the surrender of possession of such Subleased Premises to Lessor and transfer of operational responsibility of such Subleased Premises (including licenses as provided in Section 45.1.4 of the Lease, or otherwise) to Lessor or its designee.
 
        . Except as expressly permitted by the Lease, no Sublease shall be assigned nor shall any Subleased Premises be further sublet nor shall there be any further Transfers of the Leased Property of any Facility or any portion thereof (including any Subleased Premises) without, in each instance, the prior written consent of Lessor in accordance with the terms of the Lease, and neither this Agreement nor Lessor's consent to any Sublease shall (a) constitute a consent to any subsequent Transfers of the Lease, the Leased Property or any interests thereon or the engagement of a manager, or (b) be construed as a waiver, release, or relinquishment by Lessor of any of Lessor's rights and privileges under the Lease. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Lessee and Sublessee acknowledge and agree that any assignment (or deemed assignment) of any Sublease or any interest therein by Sublessee and any further subletting or sub-subletting of the Subleased Premises, or any portion thereof, shall, except to the extent otherwise permitted by the Lease, require the prior written consent of Lessor in accordance with the terms of the Lease.
3.
No Further Assignment, Subletting or Other Transfers
 
        . Lessor, Lessee and Sublessee agree as follows:
4.
Assignment of Lessee's Rights Against Sublessee
 
H-1 - 4
 
 
 
 
(a)       If Sublessee shall be in default of any obligation under any Sublease beyond any applicable cure period provided for therein, which default shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Lease, following any applicable notice and cure period provided to Lessee under the Lease, also constitute an Event of Default by Lessee under the Lease, then Lessor shall be permitted to avail itself of all of the rights and remedies available to Lessee in connection therewith.
 
(b)       Upon the occurrence during the continuance of an event of default by Sublessee under the Sublease, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lessor shall be permitted (by assignment of a cause of action or otherwise) to institute an action or proceeding against Sublessee in the name of Lessee in order to enforce Lessee's rights under any Sublease, and also shall be permitted to take all ancillary actions (e.g., serve default notices and demands) in the name of Lessee as Lessor reasonably shall determine to be necessary.
 
(c)       Lessee agrees to cooperate with Lessor, and to execute such documents as shall be reasonably necessary, in connection with the implementation of the foregoing rights of Lessor.
 
(d)       Lessee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the exercise by Lessor of any of the foregoing rights and remedies shall not constitute an election of remedies, and shall not impair Lessor's entitlement to pursue other rights and remedies directly against Lessee.
 
       
5.
Grant of Security Interest.
 
(a)        Pursuant to Section 16.9 of the Lease, and for the purpose of securing the payment and performance obligations of Sublessee under each Sublease and this Agreement and Lessee's obligations under the Lease, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
(i)        Sublessee, as debtor, hereby grants to Collateral Agent, as secured party, for the benefit of Collateral Agent and the Persons comprising Lessor, a security interest and an express contractual lien upon all of Sublessees right, title and interest in and to Lessees Personal Property and any and all products, rents, proceeds and profits thereof (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding Lessees Intangible Property) in which Lessee now owns or hereafter acquires an interest or right, including any leased Lessees Personal Property (collectively, the Collateral).  This Agreement constitutes a security agreement covering all such Collateral.  The security interest granted to Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral in this Section 5(a)(i) is intended by Collateral Agent and Sublessee to be subordinate to any security interest granted in connection with the purchase money financing or leasing of all or any portion of such Lessees Personal Property so long as the lessor or financier of such Lessees Personal Property agrees to
 
H-1 - 5
 
 
 
 
This clause shall be self-operative and no further instrument of subordination shall be required
give Collateral Agent and Master Lessor written notice of any default by Lessee and/or Sublessee under the terms of such lease or financing arrangement, to give Lessor a reasonable time following such notice to cure any such default and consents to Lessors written assumption of such lease or financing arrangement upon Lessors curing of any such defaults.  
.  This security agreement and the security interest created herein shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and/or any or all Subleases with respect to any or all of the Facilities.
 
(ii)       Sublessee hereby authorizes Collateral Agent to file such financing statements, continuation statements and other documents as may be necessary or desirable to perfect or continue the perfection of Collateral Agents security interest in the Collateral.  In addition, if required by Collateral Agent at any time during the term of this Agreement or the term of any Sublease, Sublessee shall execute and deliver to Collateral Agent, in form reasonably satisfactory to Collateral Agent, additional security agreements, financing statements, fixture filings and such other documents as Collateral Agent may reasonably require to perfect or continue the perfection of Collateral Agents security interest in  the Collateral.  In the event Sublessee fails to execute any financing statement or other documents for the perfection or continuation of Collateral Agents security interest, Sublessee hereby appoints Collateral Agent as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact to execute any such documents on its behalf, which power of attorney shall be irrevocable and is deemed to be coupled with an interest.
 
(iii)      Sublessee will give Collateral Agent at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any change in Sublessees name, identity, jurisdiction of organization or corporate structure.  With respect to any such change, Sublessee will promptly execute and deliver such instruments, documents and notices and take such actions, as Collateral Agent deems necessary or desirable to create, perfect and protect the security interests of Collateral Agent in the Collateral.
 
(iv)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under the Lease, or a default under this Agreement which is not cured within any applicable cure period provided for herein or therein, Collateral Agent shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of this Section 5(a), to exercise any and all rights or remedies available to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code, or available to a lessor under the laws of the State, with respect to Lessees Personal Property and the Intangible Property, including the right to sell the same at public or private sale.
 
(b)       .
Appointment of Collateral Agent
 
(i)        Each Person comprising Lessor hereby irrevocably appoints HCP (the Collateral Agent) as the collateral agent hereunder and under all other documents related hereto and authorizes Collateral Agent in such capacity, to take such
 
H-1 - 6
 
 
 
 
actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to Collateral Agent in such capacity by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  In performing its functions and duties hereunder, Collateral Agent shall act for itself and as agent for each Person comprising Lessor hereunder and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for Sublessee.  The provisions of this Section 5(b) are solely for the benefit of Collateral Agent and each Person comprising Lessor hereunder, and Sublessee shall no rights as a third party beneficiary(ies) of any of such provisions.
 
(ii)       The Collateral Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Collateral Agent.
 
(iii)      The Collateral Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Persons comprising Lessor hereunder and Sublessee.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Persons comprising Lessor hereunder shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Persons comprising Lessor hereunder and shall have accepted such appointment within ten (10) days after the retiring Collateral Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Collateral Agent may, on behalf of each Person comprising Lessor hereunder, appoint a successor Collateral Agent; provided that if the Collateral Agent shall notify Sublessee and each Person comprising Lessor hereunder that no such successor is willing to accept such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (i) the retiring Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (except that in the case of any Collateral held by the Collateral Agent on behalf of each Person comprising Lessor hereunder, the Collateral Agent may continue to hold such Collateral until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed and such Collateral is assigned to such successor Collateral Agent) and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Collateral Agent shall instead be made by or to each Person comprising Lessor hereunder directly, until such time as the Persons comprising Lessor hereunder appoint a successor Collateral Agent.
 
(iv)       Upon the acceptance of a successor's or replacement's appointment as Collateral Agent, such successor or replacement shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent and the retiring Collateral Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder. After the retiring Collateral Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 5(b) shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Collateral Agent and its sub-agents in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Collateral Agent was acting in such capacity.
 
H-1 - 7
 
 
 
 
(c)       Sublessee hereby agrees to comply with and observe in all material respects Sublessee's obligations under all leases and residential care agreements, including Sublessee's obligations pertaining to the maintenance and disposition of resident or tenant security deposits (provided, however, that no breach of Sublessees obligations with respect to such leases and residential care agreements shall constitute a default hereunder until and unless any such breaches or defaults affect a material number of the leases and residential care agreements at any one Facility). Upon delivery of notice by Lessor to Sublessee of Lessor's exercise of Lessor's rights under this Section 5, at any time after an Event of Default under the Lease with respect to any Subleased Premises or an Event of Default that entitles Lessor to exercise remedies with respect to Facilities other than the Facility from which such Event of Default emanated, or a default under this Agreement which is not cured within any applicable cure period provided for herein, and without the necessity of Lessor entering upon and taking and maintaining control of any Subleased Premises directly, by a receiver, or by any other manner or proceeding permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, Lessor immediately shall have, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, all rights, powers and authority granted to Lessee under any lease or residential care agreement relating to such Subleased Premises, including the right, power and authority to modify the terms of any such lease or residential care agreement for such Subleased Premises, or extend or terminate any such lease or residential care agreement for such Subleased Premises. Following an Event of Default under the Lease with respect to any Subleased Premises or an Event of Default that entitles Lessor to exercise remedies with respect to Facilities other than the Facility from which such Event of Default emanated, or a default under this Agreement which is not cured within any applicable cure period provided for herein, unless Lessor elects in its sole discretion to assume the obligations of Lessee under any lease or residential care agreement for any Subleased Premises, Lessor shall not (i) be obligated to perform any of the terms, covenants or conditions contained in such lease or residential care agreement relating to such Subleased Premises (or otherwise have any obligation with respect to such lease or residential care agreement relating to such Subleased Premises) or (ii) be obligated to appear in or defend any action or proceeding relating to such lease or residential care agreement relating to such Subleased Premises. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5(c), but subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the Lease, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Lease with respect to any Subleased Premises or an Event of Default that entitles Lessor to exercise remedies with respect to Facilities other than the Facility from which such Event of Default emanated, or a default under this Agreement which is not cured within any applicable cure period provided for herein, Sublessee shall be entitled to exercise any and all rights under any Occupancy Arrangements relating to any Subleased Facility, including Sublessee's right, power and authority to modify the terms of any such Occupancy Arrangements or extend or terminate such Occupancy Arrangements.
