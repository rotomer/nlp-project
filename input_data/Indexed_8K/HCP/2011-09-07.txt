On
August 31, 2011
, Thomas M. Klaritch, Executive Vice President  Medical Office Properties of HCP, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a Rule 10b5-1 sales plan for the period between September 30, 2011 and
January 31
, 2013.  Under the sales plan, as long as the Company's common stock meets certain threshold prices at designated times, Mr. Klaritch could effect a cashless exercise of up to an aggregate of 64,540 employee stock options.
 
The aforementioned Rule 10b5-1 sales plan is intended to satisfy the Company's insider trading policy and the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Rule 10b5-1 permits an individual who is not in possession of material non-public information, at the time the Rule 10b5-1 sales plan is adopted, to establish a pre-arranged plan to exercise stock options and buy or sell specified amounts of company stock.  Using such sales plans, among other objectives, individuals may gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period.
 
Transactions for Mr. Klaritch under his Rule 10b5-1 sales plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Except as may be required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to report any modifications or terminations of any such sales plan, nor report any Rule 10b5-1 sales plans that may be adopted by other officers or employees of the Company.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
