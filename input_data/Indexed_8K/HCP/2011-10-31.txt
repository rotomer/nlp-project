LONG BEACH, CA, October 31, 2011  HCP (the "Company" or "we") (NYSE:HCP) announced results for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
 
 
(1)
    
The impairment charge during the three months ended September 30, 2011 relates to our senior secured loan to Cirrus Health ("Cirrus"). See the "Other Events" section of this release for additional information regarding the Cirrus loan impairment.
 
(2)
    
The impairment charge during the three months ended September 30, 2010 relates to our past investment in HCP Ventures II. In addition to this impairment, operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 include the impact of the following: (i) income of $0.02 per share related to gain on sales of bond investments and (ii) a charge of $0.02 per share in connection with acquisition pursuit costs.
 
FFO, FFO as adjusted and FAD are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that the Company believes are helpful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts. See the "Funds From Operations" section of this release for additional information regarding FFO and FFO as adjusted and the "Funds Available for Distribution" section for additional information regarding FAD.
 
STRATEGIC VENTURE WITH BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING
 
On September 1, 2011, we completed a strategic venture with Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. ("Brookdale") that includes 37 HCP-owned senior living communities previously leased to or operated by Horizon Bay Retirement Living ("Horizon Bay"). As part of this transaction, Brookdale acquired Horizon Bay and: (i) assumed an existing triple-net lease for nine of our communities; (ii) entered into a new triple-net lease related to four of our communities; (iii) assumed Horizon Bay's management of three of our communities, one of which was recently developed by HCP; and (iv) entered into management contracts and a joint venture agreement for a 10% interest in the real estate and operations for 21 of our communities in a RIDEA structure.
 
OTHER EVENTS
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we made investments of $43 million to fund development and other capital projects, primarily in our life science and medical office segments.
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we concluded our loan to Cirrus was impaired. This impairment was as a result of: (i) the continued delay and costs associated with the sale of certain collateral assets (primarily Cirrus' interests in partnerships operating surgical centers); and (ii) the decline in the operating performance and value of certain of Cirrus' collateral assets. Therefore, in September 2011, we recognized a non-cash charge of $15.4 million that reduced the carrying value of our loan from $91.1 million to $75.7 million, which represents the fair value of the related collateral supporting this loan.
 
Subsequent to quarter end, LinkedIn Corporation ("LinkedIn") agreed to an expansion of their corporate headquarters at our Shoreline campus in Mountain View, California. The expansion totaling 373,000 sq. ft. consists of: (i) a lease totaling 303,000 sq. ft. with terms that include an extension to March 2023 and an increase to the rental rates by 71% over in-place rents effective January 2012; and (ii) a lease for a new 70,000 sq. ft. building for a period of 10 years, which is expected to complete construction in 2013.
 
DIVIDEND
 
On October 27, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 22, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2011.
 
OUTLOOK
 
For the full year 2011, we expect FFO applicable to common shares to range between $2.46 and $2.52 per share; FFO as adjusted applicable to common shares to range between $2.65 and $2.71 per share; FAD applicable to common shares to range between $2.11 and $2.17 per share; and net income applicable to common shares to range between $1.56 and $1.62 per share.
 
Estimates of FFO and net income applicable to common shares include the impact of the HCR ManorCare Acquisition that closed on April 7, 2011 and the corresponding merger-related items. FFO as adjusted and FAD applicable to common shares exclude the impact of the Cirrus impairment and merger-related items.  Merger-related items are as follows: (i) direct transaction costs and (ii) negative carrying costs related to prefunding the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, which were partially offset by (iii) gains upon the reinvestment of our HCR ManorCare debt investments and other miscellaneous items. See the "Projected Future Operations" section of this report for additional information regarding the above estimates.

  The Company believes FFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or "GAAP"), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions and upon changes in control of joint ventures, plus real estate and DFL depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from the Company.
 
FFO as adjusted represents FFO before the impact of impairments, impairment recoveries and merger-related items (defined below). Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income.
 
(2)
  $26.6 million of merger-related items attributable to the HCR ManorCare Acquisition (incurred from January 1st through April 6th 2011) include the following: (i) $26.8 million of direct transaction costs, (ii) $23.9 million of interest expense associated with the $2.4 billion senior notes issued on January 24, 2011, proceeds from which were obtained to prefund the HCR ManorCare Acquisition, partially offset by (iii) $24.1 million of income related to gains upon the reinvestment of the Company's debt investment in HCR ManorCare and other miscellaneous items.
 
(3)
  Includes $0.04 per share of impairments and $0.15 per share of merger-related items; merger-related items are attributable to the HCR ManorCare Acquisition and detailed as follows:
 
(i) $0.07 per share of direct transaction costs that are discussed in footnote 2(i);
 
(ii) ($0.07) per share of income related to gains upon the reinvestment of the Company's debt investment in HCR ManorCare and other miscellaneous items that is discussed in footnote 2(iii); and
 
(iii) $0.15 per share of negative carry related to prefunding activities consisting of: (a) 76 million shares from our December 2010 and March 2011 common stock offerings (excludes 4.5 million shares in March 2011 related to the underwriters' overallotment option), which issuances increased our weighted average shares by 17 million shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2011; and (b) $0.06 per share for the interest expense related to the $2.4 billion senior notes discussed in footnote 2(ii). Proceeds from these offerings were used to prefund a portion of the cash consideration for the HCR ManorCare Acquisition.
 
 
 
 
(1)  
Funds Available for Distribution is defined as FFO as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) straight-line rents; (ii) amortization of acquired above/below market lease intangibles; (iii) amortization of debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs; (iv) amortization of stockbased compensation expense; (v) accretion and depreciation related to direct financing leases; and (vi) deferred revenues. Further, FAD is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and includes similar adjustments to compute the Company's share of FAD from its unconsolidated joint ventures. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating FAD, and accordingly, HCP's FAD may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although HCP's FAD computation may not be comparable to that of other REITs, management believes FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of the Company's ability to fund its ongoing dividend payments. In addition, management believes that in order to further understand and analyze the Company's liquidity, FAD should be compared with cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP and presented in its consolidated financial statements. FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company's performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company's liquidity.
 
(2)  
Excludes $11.3 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees for the Company's bridge loan commitment and $0.8 million related to the amortization of deferred issuance costs of the senior notes discussed above, which costs are included in merger-related items for the nine months ended September 30, 2011.
 
(3)  
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, DFL accretion includes a reduction of $14.4 million and $27.7 million respectively, and Joint venture and other FAD adjustments include a contribution of $17.6 million and $32.0 million, respectively, as a result of HCP's equity interest in the operations of HCR ManorCare, Inc. ("HCR ManorCare OpCo"). The Company's joint venture interest in HCR ManorCare OpCo is accounted for using the equity method and results in an ongoing reduction of DFL income, proportional to HCP's ownership in HCR ManorCare OpCo. Further, the Company's share of earnings from HCR ManorCare OpCo (equity income) increases for the corresponding reduction of related lease expense recognized at the HCR ManorCare OpCo level.
 
 
 
 
 
(1)  
The Company believes Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI") provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's leased properties (i.e., real estate and DFLs) at the property level on an unleveraged basis. NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of leased properties and SPP. The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable
GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
 
NOI is defined as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements, resident fees and services, and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses. NOI excludes interest income, investment management fee income, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, impairments, impairment recoveries, other income, net, income tax expenses, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures and discontinued operations. NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL accretion, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. NOI, as adjusted, is sometimes referred to as "adjusted NOI" or "cash basis NOI."
 
(2)  
Same property statistics allow management to evaluate the performance of the Company's leased property portfolio under a consistent population, which eliminates the changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties. The Company identifies its SPP as stabilized properties that are, and remained, in operations for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods presented. Accordingly, it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations to be included in the Company's same property portfolio. SPP NOI excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
 
 
 
 
 
(1)  
Except as otherwise noted above, the foregoing projections reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels, development items, property dispositions and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release. Except as otherwise noted, these estimates do not reflect the potential impact of future acquisitions, impairments, impairment recoveries, the future bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company's operators, lessees, borrowers or other obligors, the effect of any future restructuring of the Company's contractual relationships with such entities, gains or losses on marketable securities, ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, offerings of debt or existing and future litigation matters including the possibility of larger than expected litigation costs and related developments. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. The aforementioned ranges represent management's best estimate of results based upon the underlying assumptions as of the date of this press release. Except as otherwise required by law, management assumes no, and hereby disclaims any, obligation to update any of the foregoing projections as a result of new information or new or future developments.
 
(2)  
Merger-related items of $0.15 per share related to the HCR ManorCare Acquisition include the following:
 
(i) $0.07 per share of direct transaction costs, including professional fees and amortization of costs associated with the bridge loan commitment;
 
(ii) $0.14 per share of negative carry related to prefunding the transaction, which includes the impact of: (a) 76 million shares from our December 2010 and March 2011 common stock offerings (excludes 4.5 million shares in March 2011 related to the underwriters' overallotment option) on the calculation of weighted average shares and (b) the additional interest expense and amortization of fees associated with the $2.4 billion senior notes offering completed on January 24, 2011. Proceeds from these offerings were used to fund the cash consideration of the HCR ManorCare Acquisition; which are partially offset by
 
(iii) ($0.06) per share of income related to gains upon the reinvestment of the Company's debt investment in HCR ManorCare and other miscellaneous items.
 
(3)  
The Company's joint venture interest in HCR ManorCare OpCo is accounted for using the equity method and results in an ongoing reduction of DFL income, proportional to HCP's ownership in HCR ManorCare OpCo. Further, the Company's share of earnings from HCR ManorCare OpCo (equity income) increases for the corresponding reduction of related lease expense recognized at the HCR ManorCare OpCo level. The increase in the Company's equity income resulting from the decrease of HCR ManorCare OpCo lease expense represents additional non-cash income that is presented as a negative joint venture FAD adjustment.

(1)      
On April 7, 2011, the Company acquired the real estate assets of privately-owned HCR ManorCare, Inc. for $6.1 billion. After reducing the purchase price by $88 million, which represents the difference between the fair value and the par value of our HCR ManorCare debt investments (at closing) that were settled as part of this acquisition, the adjusted purchase price is $6.0 billion. The adjusted purchase price of the HCR ManorCare real estate acquisition is comprised of the following: (i) $4.0 billion of cash consideration; and (ii) $2.0 billion representing the fair value of our HCR ManorCare debt investments. In conjunction with the acquisition of the real estate assets of HCR ManorCare, the Company exercised its option to purchase an equity interest in the operations of HCR ManorCare for $95 million that represented a 9.9% equity interest at closing.

Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.
  Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges. The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company. However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges. Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
 
The following table details the calculation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage:

Annualized Debt Service
.
  The most recent monthly interest and principal amortization due to HCP as of period end annualized for 12 months. The Company uses Annualized Debt Service for purposes of determining Debt Service Coverage.
 
Annualized Revenues.
  The most recent monthly base rent (including additional rent floors), income from direct financing leases and/or interest income annualized for 12 months. Annualized Revenues for operating properties under a RIDEA structure are calculated based on the most recent monthly NOI annualized for 12 months. Annualized Revenues do not include tenant recoveries, additional rents in excess of floors and non-cash revenue adjustments (i.e., straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, interest accretion and deferred revenues). The Company uses Annualized Revenues for the purpose of determining Relationship Concentrations, Lease Expirations and Debt Investment Maturities.
 
Assets Held for Sale

  Assets of discontinued operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, .
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
Assisted Living Facility ("ALF"). 
A senior housing facility that predominantly consists of assisted living units is classified by the Company as an ALF.
 
Beds/Units/Square Feet.
  Senior housing facilities are measured in units (e.g., studio, one or two bedroom units). Life science facilities and medical office buildings are measured in square feet. Post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are measured in licensed bed count.
 
Cash Flow Coverage ("CFC"). 
Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM for the most recent 12 months of available data divided by the Same Period Rent. Cash Flow Coverage is a supplemental measure of a property's ability to generate cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM. The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.
 
Consolidated Assets.
  Total assets as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Consolidated Debt.
  The carrying amount of bank line of credit, bridge and term loans (if applicable), senior unsecured notes, mortgage and other secured debt, and other debt as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Consolidated Gross Assets.
  The carrying amount of total assets, excluding investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization, as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Consolidated Market Capitalization.
  Consolidated Debt at Book Value plus Consolidated Market Equity.
 
Consolidated Market Equity.
  The total number of outstanding shares of the Company's common stock multiplied by the closing price per share of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end, plus the total number of convertible partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end (adjusted for stock splits), plus the total number of outstanding shares of the Company's preferred stock multiplied by the closing price of its preferred stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end.
 
Consolidated Secured Debt.
  Mortgage and other secured debt secured by real estate excluding debt on assets held for sale as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Continuing Care Retirement Community ("CCRC"). 
A senior housing facility which provides at least three levels of care (i.e., independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing) is classified by the Company as a CCRC.
 
Debt Investments.
  Loans secured by a direct interest in real estate and mezzanine loans.
 
Debt Service
. 
The periodic payment of interest expense and principal amortization on secured loans.
 
Development.
  Includes ground-up construction and redevelopments.
 
 
Direct Financing Lease ("DFL").
  The Company uses the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield.
 
Estimated Completion Date.
 
For development projects, management's estimate of the date the core and shell structure improvements are expected to be or have been completed. For redevelopment projects, management's estimate of the time in which major construction activity in relation to the scope of the project has been substantially completed.
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
 The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding impairments and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure both its operating performance and liquidity. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from its operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, impairments, impairment recoveries, and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure the Company's operating performance independent of its capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of its operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare its operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments. The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with net income (the primary measure of the Company's performance) and the other required GAAP measures of its performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of the Company's operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of its performance between periods and as against other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity. Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
 
The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA from net income:

Facility EBITDAR ("EBITDAR").
  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company), for the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date presented. The Company uses Facility EBITDAR in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage. Facility EBITDAR has limitations as an analytical tool.  Facility EBITDAR does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, Facility EBITDAR does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management. The Company utilizes Facility EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company. Facility EBITDAR includes the greater of (i) contractual management fees or (ii) an imputed management fee of 5% for senior housing facilities and post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and 2% for acute care hospitals which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries. All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
 
 
 
Facility EBITDA
R
M ("EBITDA
R
M").
  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company
), for the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date presented.  The Company uses Facility EBITDARM in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage. Facility EBITDARM has limitations as an analytical tool. Facility EBITDARM does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, Facility EBITDARM does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management. The Company utilizes Facility EBITDARM as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company. All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
 
Financial Leverage.
 
Total Debt divided by Total Gross Assets. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. The Company believes that the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated gross assets is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Financial Leverage. The Company's computation of its Financial Leverage may not be identical to the computations of financial leverage reported by other companies. The Company's share of total debt is not intended to reflect its actual liability or ability to access assets should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.
 
Fixed Charges.
 Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends. The Company uses Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred stockholders for purposes of presenting Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage. However, the usefulness of Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
 
Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD").
  Funds Available for Distribution is defined as FFO as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) straight-line rents; (ii) amortization of acquired above/below market lease intangibles; (iii) amortization of debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs; (iv) amortization of stockbased compensation expense; (v) accretion and depreciation related to direct financing leases; and (vi) deferred revenues. Further, FAD is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and includes similar adjustments to compute the Company's share of FAD from its unconsolidated joint ventures. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating FAD, and accordingly, HCP's FAD may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although HCP's FAD computation may not be comparable to that of other REITs, management believes FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of the Company's ability to fund its ongoing dividend payments. In addition, management believes that in order to further understand and analyze the Company's liquidity, FAD should be compared with cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP and presented in its consolidated financial statements. FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company's performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company's liquidity.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO").
  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP.  FFO is defined as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions and upon changes in control of joint ventures, plus real estate and DFL depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful.  The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate and DFL depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate investment trust between periods or as compared to other companies.  While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. Further, the Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
For a reconciliation of FFO to net income, please refer to the slide in this supplemental information package captioned "Consolidated Funds From Operations."
 
FFO as adjusted represents FFO before the impact of impairments, impairment recoveries and merger-related items.  Merger-related items include estimated acquisition pursuit costs that consist primarily of professional fees and the impact of common stock offering which increases the weighted average shares outstanding, when such proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration of the Company's pending acquisitions.  Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement.  This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income.
 
FFO Payout Ratio.
  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common stockholders.  FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share is subject to the same limitations noted in the definition of FFO above.

HCP Life Science includes the following partnerships: (i) Torrey Pines Science Center LP (50%), (ii) Britannia Biotech Gateway LP (55%) and (iii) LASDK LP (63%).  The unconsolidated joint ventures were acquired as part of the Company's purchase of Slough Estates USA Inc. on August 1, 2007.

Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI").
  A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and SPP.  The Company defines NOI as rental revenues, including tenant reimbursements, resident fees and services, and income from direct financing leases, less property level operating expenses.  NOI excludes interest income, investment management fee income, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, impairments, impairment recoveries, other income, net, income taxes, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures and discontinued operations.  The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis.  NOI, as adjusted, is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL accretion, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. NOI, as adjusted, is sometimes referred to as "adjusted NOI" or "cash basis NOI."  The Company uses NOI and NOI, as adjusted, to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP.  The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.  NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by GAAP since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items.  Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
 
The following table reconciles NOI from net income:
 
 
Occupancy
.
  For life science facilities and medical office buildings, occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased where rental payments have commenced, including month-to-month leases, as of the end of the period reported. For senior housing facilities, post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, occupancy represents the facilities' average operating occupancy for the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date reported. The percentages are calculated based on licensed beds, available beds and units for senior housing facilities, post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, respectively. The percentages shown exclude newly completed facilities under lease-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. All facility financial performance data were derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company. For the same property portfolio, occupancy for senior housing facilities, post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are presented based on the average operating occupancy for trailing three-month period one quarter in arrears from the date reported.
 
Owned Portfolio.
  Represents owned properties subject to operating leases and DFLs, properties operated under a RIDEA structure and debt investments, and excludes properties under development, including redevelopment, land held for development and real estate owned by the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures.
 
 
Pooled Leases.
  Two or more leases to the same operator/tenant or their subsidiaries under which their obligations are combined by virtue of a master lease, or multiple master leases, a pooling agreement, or multiple pooling agreements, or cross-guaranties. For example, Sunrise Senior Living percentage pooled consists of 47 assets under 6 separate pools.
 
Quality Mix. 
Represents non-medicaid revenues as a percent of total revenues for the trailing 12 months and is one quarter in arrears from the period presented.
 
Redevelopment Projects.
  Properties that require significant capital expenditures (generally more than 25% of acquisition cost or existing basis) to achieve stabilization or to change the use of the properties.
 
Rehabilitation Hospitals ("Rehab").

Rental and RIDEA Revenues.
  Represents rental and related revenues, tenant recoveries, resident fees and services, and
income from direct financing leases.
 
Retention Rate.
  Represents the ratio of total renewed square feet to the total square feet expiring and available for lease, excluding the square feet for tenant leases terminated for default or buy-out prior to the expiration of their lease
.
 
RIDEA.
  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as "RIDEA")
.
 
Same Period Rent.
  The base rent plus additional rent due to the Company over the most recent trailing twelve-month period as of period end.  The Company uses Same Period Rent for purposes of determining property-level Cash Flow Coverage.
 
Same Property Portfolio ("SPP").
  Same property statistics allow management to evaluate the performance of the Company's real estate portfolio under a consistent population, which eliminates the changes in the composition of the Company's portfolio of properties. The Company identifies its same property portfolio as stabilized properties that are, and remained, in operations for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods presented.  Accordingly, it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations to be included in the Company's same property portfolio.  SPP NOI excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
 
Senior Housing.
  ALFs, ILFs and CCRCs.
 
Specialty Hospitals.
  Specialty hospitals are licensed as acute care hospitals but focus on providing care in specific areas such as cardiac, orthopedic and women's conditions, or specific procedures such as surgery and are less likely to provide emergency services.
 
Square Feet.
  The square footage for properties, excluding square footage for development or redevelopment properties prior to completion.
 
Stabilized.
  Newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease up (typically when the tenant(s) controls the physical use of 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. Newly completed developments, including redevelopments, are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service.
 
Total Debt. 
Consolidated Debt at Book Value plus the Company's pro rata share of debt from the Investment Management Platform.
 
Total Gross Assets.
  Consolidated Gross Assets plus the Company's pro rata share of total assets from the Investment Management Platform, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization.
 
The following table details the calculation of Total Gross Assets:

Total Secured Debt.
 Consolidated secured debt plus the Company's pro rata share of mortgage debt from the Investment Management Platform.
 
Yield.
  Yield is calculated as Net Operating Income, as adjusted, divided by total investment.  For acquisitions, initial yields are calculated as projected Net Operating Income, 12 months forward, as adjusted, as of the closing date divided by total acquisition cost.  The total acquisition cost basis includes the initial purchase price, the effects of adjusting assumed debt to market, lease intangible adjustments and all transaction costs.
