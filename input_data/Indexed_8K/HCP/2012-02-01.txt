(e)         Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On January 26, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of HCP, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), approved, and the Company entered into, separate employment agreements (the "Employment Agreements" and each an, "Employment Agreement") with Paul F. Gallagher, the Company's Executive Vice President  Chief Investment Officer, and Timothy M. Schoen, the Company's Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer.
 
Each Employment Agreement provides for the executive to receive an initial base salary of $500,000, which may subsequently be increased by the Company but not reduced, and an annual incentive bonus based on Company and individual performance criteria as determined by the Compensation Committee.  Each executive is also entitled to participate in the Company's benefit plans made available generally to the Company's senior executives.  Each Employment Agreement provides for a three-year term, which will be automatically extended for additional one-year periods unless either party gives prior written notice that the term will not be extended.
 
If the executive's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreements), the executive will be entitled to a severance benefit, to be paid in a lump sum, equal to the sum of (i) his base salary at the annualized rate in effect on his termination date, and (ii) the greater of his annual incentive bonus for the last fiscal year of the Company for which the Compensation Committee has determined bonuses for the Company's executives generally prior to the termination date (the "last bonus year") or the average of his annual incentive bonuses for the last three fiscal years of the Company ending with the last bonus year. In addition, any portion of the executive's then-outstanding equity awards granted by the Company that are scheduled to vest within two years following the termination date will immediately vest (or, in the case of awards subject to performance-based vesting requirements, the award will be held open until the end of the relevant performance period and, as to any portion of the award eligible to vest based on the level of performance achieved, the executive will be credited with two additional years of service after the termination date for purposes of applying any time-based vesting requirements applicable to the award). In each case, the executive's right to receive the severance benefits described above is contingent on the executive providing a general release of claims in favor of the Company and complying with certain non-solicitation and other restrictive covenants set forth in the Employment Agreement. In addition, in the event of termination of the executive's employment as described above, the executive would generally be entitled to reimbursement for his COBRA premiums for continued health coverage for up to 12 months following his termination date.
 
In the event the executive becomes entitled to severance benefits under the Company's Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Plan"), he would be entitled to receive the benefits provided under the CIC Plan and not the benefits provided under his Employment Agreement.
 
The foregoing summary of the Employment Agreements is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Employment Agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibits. The following exhibits are being filed herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into on January 26, 2012, by and between HCP, Inc. (the "Company") and Paul F. Gallagher("Executive").  Where the context permits, references to "the Company" shall include the Company and any successor of the Company.
 
WHEREAS, the Company and Executive mutually desire to set forth herein the terms and conditions pursuant to which Executive will continue to serve as the Executive Vice President  Chief Investment Officer of the Company, effective as of January 26, 2012 (the "Effective Date").
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and agreements herein contained, together with other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:
 
1.         .  Subject to Section 2 hereof, from and after the Effective Date, Executive shall, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, be employed by the Company as the Executive Vice President  Chief Investment Officer of the Company.  The principal location of Executive's employment with the Company shall be at the Company's headquarters in Long Beach, California, although Executive understands and agrees that Executive may be required to travel from time to time for business reasons.  During the Term (as defined in Section 2), Executive shall be a full-time employee of the Company, shall dedicate substantially all of Executive's working time to the Company, and shall have no other employment or other business ventures which are undisclosed to the Company or which conflict with Executive's duties under this Agreement.  Executive shall have such authorities, duties and responsibilities as the Company's chief executive officer (or his delegate) may from time to time assign to him and reasonably consistent with those customarily performed by an officer holding the position set forth above with a company having a similar size and nature of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from participating in trade associations or industry organizations which are related to the business of the Company or engaging in charitable, civic or political activities, so long as such interests do not materially interfere, individually or in the aggregate, with the performance of Executive's duties hereunder.  Executive agrees that he shall comply with the corporate policies of the Company as they are in effect from time to time throughout the Term (including, without limitation, the Company's business conduct and ethics policies, as they may change from time to time).
SERVICES AND DUTIES
 
2.         .  Executive's employment under the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date.  Such employment shall continue for an initial term of three (3) years following the Effective Date (the "Initial Term"), which will be automatically extended on the last day of the Initial Term for an additional one (1)-year term and on each anniversary of the last day of the Initial Term thereafter, unless either Executive or the Company has given written notice to the other no less than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Term then in effect that the Term shall not be so extended.  As used herein, the "Term"
TERM
shall refer to the Initial Term and any extension thereof pursuant to the preceding sentence.  Provision of notice that the Term shall not be extended or further extended, as the case may be, shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement and shall not constitute "Good Reason" for purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above, the Term shall earlier expire immediately upon the termination of Executive's employment pursuant to Section 5 hereof.
 
3.        
COMPENSATION.
 
a)         .  The Company shall pay to Executive an initial base salary in the amount of $500,000 per annum in accordance with the regular payroll practices of the Company (the base salary as in effect from time to time, the "Base Compensation").  Payment of the Base Compensation is subject to customary employee contributions to any benefit programs in which Executive is enrolled.  The Base Compensation may be increased from time to time at the Company's sole discretion, but in no event shall the Base Compensation be reduced without Executive's approval.
Base Compensation
 
b)         .  For each calendar year during the Term, Executive shall be eligible to receive an annual cash incentive award (an "Annual Bonus"), the actual amount of such bonus will be determined based on the achievement of performance criteria relating to both Executive and the Company, as determined each year in good faith by the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company (or any successor thereto).  The Annual Bonus, if any, shall be paid to Executive by no later than March 15 of the year following the year to which such Annual Bonus relates, so long as Executive is actively employed by the Company and has not provided a notice of resignation to the Company or received a notice of termination from the Company as of the date of payment.
Annual Cash Bonus
 
c)         .  All taxable compensation payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to any applicable withholding taxes and such other taxes as are required under Federal law or the law of any state or governmental body to be collected with respect to compensation paid by the Company to Executive.
Tax Withholding

BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES
 
a)         .  During the Term, Executive shall be eligible to participate in all fringe benefits, perquisites, and such other benefit plans and arrangements as are made available generally to the Company's senior executives.  The benefits described herein shall be subject to the applicable terms of the applicable plans and shall be governed in all respects in accordance with the terms of such plans as from time to time in effect.  Nothing in this Section 4, however, shall require the Company to maintain any benefit plan or provide any type or level of benefits to its current or former employees, including Executive.
Retirement and Welfare Benefits

The Company shall reimburse Executive for any and all expenses reasonably incurred by Executive during the Term in performing Executive's duties hereunder, including travel, meals and accommodations, upon submission by Executive of vouchers or receipts and in compliance with such rules and policies relating thereto as the Company may from time to time adopt.  Executive agrees to promptly submit and document any reimbursable expenses in accordance with the Company's expense reimbursement policies to facilitate the timely reimbursement of such expenses.
Reimbursement of Expenses
 
5.         .  The Term and Executive's employment hereunder may be terminated (1) by the Company for "Cause" (as defined and determined below), effective on the date on which a written notice to such effect (a "Cause Termination Notice") is delivered to Executive; (2) by the Company at any time without Cause (which includes pursuant to an election by the Company not to renew the Term, the written notice (pursuant to Section 2) of which shall be deemed a notice of termination of Executive's employment hereunder), effective sixty (60) days following the date on which a written notice to such effect is delivered to Executive; (3) by Executive for "Good Reason" (as defined and determined below), in accordance with the notice, cure and termination periods set forth in the definition of such term below; or (4) by Executive at any time other than for Good Reason, effective sixty (60) days following the date on which a written notice to such effect is delivered to the Company (or its successors).  In the event that the Company provides Executive notice of termination without Cause pursuant to clause (2) or Executive provides the Company notice of termination pursuant to clause (3) or clause (4), the Company will have the option to place the Executive on paid administrative leave during the notice period.  Upon any termination of Executive's employment hereunder, Executive shall be entitled to receive the following:  (i) any accrued but unpaid Base Compensation (to be paid as provided in Section 3(a)); (ii) reimbursement for expenses incurred by Executive prior to the date of termination in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof; (iii) vested benefits, if any, to which Executive may be entitled under the Company's employee benefit plans as of the date of termination; and (iv) any additional amounts or benefits due under any applicable plan, program, agreement or arrangement of the Company or its Affiliates (the amounts and benefits described in clauses (i) through (iv) above, collectively, the "Accrued Benefits").  Accrued Benefits under this Section 5 shall in all events be paid in accordance with the Company's payroll procedures, expense reimbursement procedures or plan terms, as applicable, or in accordance with applicable law.
TERMINATION
 
a)         .  If Executive's employment hereunder is terminated during the Term by the Company for Cause or by Executive without Good Reason, Executive shall not be entitled to any further compensation or benefits other than the Accrued Benefits.

b)         .  Subject to Section 5(e) below, if Executive's employment hereunder is terminated during the Term (I) by the Company other than for Cause (and other than due to Executive's death or "Disability" (as defined below) or a decision by the Company not to extend the Term as provided in Section 2), or (II) by Executive with Good Reason, then Executive shall be entitled to (1) the Accrued Benefits and (2) subject to Executive's execution of a general release of claims in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (with such changes as may be reasonably required to such form to help ensure its enforceability in light of any changes in applicable law) (the "Release") within twenty-one (21) days following such termination of employment, and the expiration of any revocation period with respect to such Release provided by applicable law, and
Termination by the Company without Cause or by Executive With Good Reason
provided that Executive does not materially breach the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 6 hereof or in any other agreement between Executive and the Company or to which Executive is a party (collectively, "Restrictive Covenants") or any other ongoing obligation to which Executive is subject as of the date of termination:
 
(i)         an amount equal to one (1) times the sum of (x) Executive's Base Compensation, at the rate in effect on the date of Executive's termination of employment and (y) the greater of (I) Executive's annual incentive bonus paid or payable for the last fiscal year of the Company for which the Compensation Committee has determined bonuses for the Company's executives generally prior to the date of such termination or (II) the average of the Executive's annual incentive bonuses for the three consecutive fiscal years of the Company ending with the last fiscal year of the Company for which the Compensation Committee has determined bonuses for the Company's executives generally prior to the date of such termination (or, if less, the average of Executive's annual incentive bonuses for the entire period of his employment with the Company), such amount to be paid in a lump sum in the month following the month in which Executive's Separation from Service (as defined below) occurs; and
 
(ii)        each equity-based award granted by the Company to Executive that is outstanding on the date of termination will immediately vest as to any portion of the award that is scheduled to vest with two (2) years following the termination date; provided, however, that as to any such award that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements for which the applicable performance period is in progress on the termination date, such award shall remain open until the end of such performance period and, upon a determination thereafter by the Compensation Committee as to the relevant level of performance achieved and the portion of the award eligible to vest based on such determination, Executive will be credited with two (2) years of continued service, as measured from the date of Executive's termination of employment, for purposes of applying any time-based vesting requirements applicable to the award.  Any portion of any equity-based award granted by the Company to Executive that is not vested after giving effect to the foregoing acceleration provisions shall terminate as of Executive's date of termination (or, in the case of a performance-based award, as of the date of the Compensation Committee's determination of the relevant level of performance achieved).
 
c)         .  The Term and Executive's employment hereunder shall automatically terminate upon Executive's death or Disability.  If Executive's employment hereunder terminates due to death or Disability, then Executive shall not be entitled to any further compensation or benefits other than the Accrued Benefits.
Termination Due to Death or Disability
 
d)         .

Welfare Benefit Continuation
e)         .  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in the event that Executive would be entitled to severance benefits under the Company's Change in Control Severance Plan, or any successor plan thereto (the "CIC Plan"), in connection with a termination of his employment described in Section 5(b) or Section 5(d) above, Executive will be entitled to receive the benefits provided under the CIC Plan.  In no event will Executive be entitled to receive severance benefits under both the CIC Plan and this Agreement.
Change in Control Plan
 
f)          .  For purposes of this Agreement:
Definitions
 
"Affiliate" means an affiliate of the Company (or other referenced entity, as the case may be) as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
"Cause" means the occurrence of any of the following: (i) Executive's willful and continued failure to perform his duties with the Corporation (other than any such failure resulting from his or her incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for performance is delivered to Executive by the Company, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that Executive has not performed his duties; (ii) Executive's willful and continued failure to follow and comply with the policies of the Company as in effect from time to time (other than any such failure resulting from Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for performance is delivered to Executive by the Company, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that Executive has not followed or complied with such Company policies; (iii) Executive's willful commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty resulting in material economic or financial injury to the Company; (iv) Executive's willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct, in each case which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company; (v) Executive's breach of any provision of Section 6 of this Agreement; or (vi) Executive's indictment for, conviction of, or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any felony.
 
For purposes of clarification, if the definition of "Cause" set forth above, and the process associated with it, differs from the definition of cause (or similar term) in any stock incentive plan or agreement of the Company or any of its Affiliates, including the Company's incentive stock award plan or any other such plan or agreement under which a grant of restricted stock shall be made, the definition set forth above shall control.
 
"Disability" means that Executive (i) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (ii) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than 3 months under an accident and health plan, or disability plan, covering employees of the company or an Affiliate of the Company.
"Good Reason" means the occurrence, without the express prior written consent of Executive, of any of the following events: (i) the failure by the Company to pay the Executive any portion of Executive's Base Compensation within ten (10) days of the date such compensation is due, (ii) the relocation of Executive's principal location of employment, to a location outside a fifty (50) mile radius from Long Beach, California, (iii) any material diminution of Executive's duties, responsibilities or authorities hereunder, (iv) any material breach by the Company of any of its material obligations to Executive, or (v) any failure of the Company to obtain the assumption in writing of its obligations under this Agreement by any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets within 30 days after any reconstruction, amalgamation, combination, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, unless such assumption occurs by operation of law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Good Reason" to terminate Executive's employment shall not exist unless (a) a written notice has first been delivered to the Board by Executive (the "Good Reason Notice"), which Good Reason Notice (1) specifically identifies the event(s) Executive believes constitutes Good Reason and (2) provides 30 days from the date of such Good Reason Notice for the Company to cure such circumstances (the "Good Reason Period") and (b) the Company has failed to timely cure such circumstances.  If the Company fails to timely cure such circumstances in accordance with the foregoing, Executive may send a notice to the Board that he is terminating his employment for Good Reason ("Good Reason Termination Notice"), in which case his employment hereunder shall thereupon be terminated for Good Reason.  If any Good Reason Notice to the Board shall not have been delivered by Executive within ninety (90) days following the date Executive becomes aware of the purported existence of a Good Reason event, or any Good Reason Termination Notice to the Board shall not have been delivered by Executive within thirty (30) days following the end of the Good Reason Period, then any purported termination of Executive's employment relating to the applicable event shall not be a termination for Good Reason under this Agreement.
 
As used herein, a "Separation from Service" occurs when Executive dies, retires, or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company that constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(1), without regard to the optional alternative definitions available thereunder.
 
g)         .  Upon a termination of Executive's employment hereunder, unless requested otherwise by the Company, Executive shall resign each position (if any) that Executive then holds as an officer of the Company or as an officer or director of any of their Affiliates.
Resignation as Officer or Director
 
h)         .  The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement shall not result in the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of any payments under this Agreement which are subject to Section 409A of the Code until the Executive has incurred a "separation from service" from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding
Section 409A
anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following an Executive's separation from service shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Executive's separation from service (or, if earlier, the Executive's date of death).  To the extent required in order to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, amounts reimbursable to Executive under this Agreement shall be paid to Executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in kind benefits provided to Executive) during one year may not affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year.  The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments described in this Agreement will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to any such payment.
 
6.         .  Executive acknowledges that during the period of his employment with the Company or any Affiliate, he shall have access to the Company's "Confidential Information" (as defined below) and will meet and develop relationships with the Company's potential and existing suppliers, financing sources, clients, customers and employees. Accordingly, Executive agrees to the following provisions of this Section 6 (in addition to Executive's confidentiality obligations to the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Company's policies as in effect from time to time).

e)         .  The Company and the Executive acknowledge that:
Confidentiality
 
(i)         The Company's business is highly competitive;
 
(ii)        The essence of that portion of the Company's business in which the Executive will be involved consists, in large degree, of trade secrets, proprietary or confidential business or financial affairs information, materials, know-how (whether or not in writing), technology, product information, personnel information regarding its employees, and intellectual property belonging to the Company and confidential and proprietary business and client relationships (all of the foregoing will be referred to collectively as "Trade Secrets"), which have been developed at great investment of time and resources by the Company Group so as to engender substantial good will of the Company, all of which are and will be the exclusive property of the Company, protected and kept secret by the Company; and
 
(iii)       Without limiting Executive's obligations under the foregoing, the Executive agrees that during the period of his employment with the Company and at all times thereafter, Executive shall keep secret and retain in strictest confidence and shall not use for his

Without limiting the foregoing, Executive shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any director, officer, partner, employee or agent of the Company Group unless in Executive's reasonable good faith judgment, such person has a need to know such Confidential Information in furtherance of the Company Group's business, and (except in connection with the business and affairs of the Company) Executive shall not disclose Confidential Information to anyone outside of the Company Group except with the Company's express written consent.
 
(iv)       Executive acknowledges that the Company's rights in its Trade Secrets and Confidential Information would be misappropriated should the Executive use or disclose to others the Trade Secrets and/or Confidential Information outside the scope of his employment pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(v)        Executive agrees that during the period of his employment with the Company, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, use, disseminate, or disclose, in whole or in part, any of the Company Group's Trade Secrets to any person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever, other than (A) in the regular and proper scope and course of Executive's employment with Company, or (B) as required by law, provided, however, that Executive will give Company reasonable advance notice of any such disclosure or use that is required by law.
 
(vi)       As used in this Agreement, each of the terms "Trade Secrets" and "Confidential Information" will not include any information that becomes generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or industry unless it becomes known due to Executive's violation of this Agreement.
 
f)          .  Executive agrees that at all times following the termination of his employment, Executive will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Company and its Affiliates in connection with (i) any and all existing or future litigation, actions or proceedings (whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or otherwise) brought by or against the Company or any of its Affiliates, or (ii) any audit of the financial statements of the Company or any Affiliate with respect to the period of time when Executive was employed by the Company or any Affiliate, in each case to the extent the Company reasonably deems Executive's cooperation necessary.  Executive shall be reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Executive as a result of such cooperation.  With respect to any and all existing or future litigation, actions or proceedings (whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or otherwise) brought against Executive in connection with his employment by the Company, the Company will honor, and proceed in accordance with, its bylaws as in effect from time to time.

g)         .  Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall limit any common law or statutory obligation that Executive may have to the Company or any of its Affiliates.

No Limitation
 
h)         .  Executive agrees and acknowledges that each restrictive covenant in this Section 6 is reasonable as to duration, terms and geographical area and that the same protects the legitimate interests of the Company and its Affiliates, imposes no undue hardship on Executive, is not injurious to the public, and that, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, any violation of this restrictive covenant shall be specifically enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Executive agrees and acknowledges that a portion of the compensation paid to Executive under this Agreement will be paid in consideration of the covenants contained in this Section 6, the sufficiency of which consideration is hereby acknowledged.  If any provision of this Section 6 as applied to Executive or to any circumstance is adjudged by a court with jurisdiction upon short notice to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall in no way affect any other circumstance or the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this Section 6.  If the scope of any such provision, or any part thereof, is too broad to permit enforcement of such provision to its full extent, Executive agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration and/or area of such provision, and/or to delete specific words or phrases, and in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.  Executive agrees and acknowledges that the breach of this Section 6 will cause irreparable injury to the Company and upon breach of any provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief by any court with jurisdiction upon short notice; provided, however, that this shall in no way limit any other remedies which the Company may have (including, without limitation, the right to seek monetary damages).  Each of the covenants in this Section 6 shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other provisions in this Agreement.

ARBITRATION
 
a)         If any legally actionable dispute arises which cannot be resolved by mutual discussion between the parties, each of Executive and the Company agree to resolve that dispute by arbitration before an arbitrator experienced in employment law.  Said arbitration will be conducted pursuant to the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures and applicable California law.  The parties agree that this arbitration agreement includes any such disputes that the Company and its related entities may have against Executive, or Executive may have against the Company and/or its related entities and/or employees, arising out of or relating to Executive's employment or its termination including any claims of discrimination or harassment in violation of applicable law and any other aspect of Executive's compensation, training, employment, or its termination.
b)         The parties further agree that this arbitration provision is the exclusive and binding remedy for any such dispute and will be used instead of any court action, which is hereby expressly waived, except for any request by either party for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief pending arbitration in accordance with applicable law or an administrative claim with an administrative agency.  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY.
 
c)         The parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in Los Angeles County, California, unless otherwise mutually agreed.
 
d)         The provisions of Section 1281.8 of the California Code of Civil Procedure with respect to provisional remedies will apply to any such arbitration.  In any such arbitration proceeding, any hearing must be transcribed by a certified court reporter and the arbitrator's decision must be set forth in writing, consistent with the law of California and supported by essential findings of fact and conclusion of law.  The arbitrator may issue any remedy or award available under applicable law but may not add to, modify, change or disregard any lawful terms of this Agreement or issue an award or remedy that is contrary to the law of California.  The parties further agree that each party shall pay its own costs and attorneys' fees, if any; provided, however, the Company shall pay any costs and expenses that Employee would not otherwise have incurred if the dispute had been adjudicated in a court of law, rather than through arbitration, including the arbitrator's fee, any administrative fee, and any filing fee in excess of the maximum court filing fee in the jurisdiction in which the arbitration is commenced.  If either party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party an award of attorneys' fees, then the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party, consistent with applicable law.
 
10.       .  Each party represents and warrants that (a) such party is not subject to any contract, arrangement, agreement, policy or understanding, or to any statute, governmental rule or regulation, that in any way limits such party's ability to enter into and fully perform such party's obligations under this Agreement; (b) such party is not otherwise unable to enter into and fully perform such party's obligations under this Agreement; and (c) upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by both parties, this Agreement shall be such party's valid and binding obligation, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.
REPRESENTATIONS
 
11.       .  In the event of any inconsistency between any provision of this Agreement and any provision of any other Company arrangement, the provisions of this Agreement shall control to the extent more favorable to Executive unless Executive otherwise agrees in a writing that expressly refers to the provision of this Agreement whose control he is waiving.
INCONSISTENCIES
12.       .  Executive shall be entitled, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to select and change a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder following Executive's death by giving written notice thereof.  In the event of Executive's death or a judicial determination of his incompetence, references in this Agreement to Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his beneficiary, estate or other legal representative.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from participating in trade associations or industry organizations which are related to the business of the Company or engaging in charitable, civic or political activities, so long as such interests do not materially interfere, individually or in the aggregate, with the performance of Executive's duties hereunder.

Any portion of any equity-based award granted by the Company to Executive that is not vested after giving effect to the foregoing acceleration provisions shall terminate as of Executive's date of termination (or, in the case of a performance-based award, as of the date of the Compensation Committee's determination of the relevant level of performance achieved).

Change in Control Plan
 
.  For purposes of this Agreement:
f)
                                      
Definitions
 
"Affiliate" means an affiliate of the Company (or other referenced entity, as the case may be) as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
"Cause" means the occurrence of any of the following: (i) Executive's willful and continued failure to perform his duties with the Corporation (other than any such failure resulting from his or her incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for performance is delivered to Executive by the Company, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that Executive has not performed his duties; (ii) Executive's willful and continued failure to follow and comply with the policies of the Company as in effect from time to time (other than any such failure resulting from Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for performance is delivered to Executive by the Company, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that Executive has not followed or complied with such Company policies; (iii) Executive's willful commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty resulting in material economic or financial injury to the Company; (iv) Executive's willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct, in each case which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company; (v) Executive's breach of any provision of Section 6 of this Agreement; or (vi) Executive's indictment for, conviction of, or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any felony.
 
For purposes of clarification, if the definition of "Cause" set forth above, and the process associated with it, differs from the definition of cause (or similar term) in any stock incentive plan or agreement of the Company or any of its Affiliates, including the Company's incentive stock award plan or any other such plan or agreement under which a grant of restricted stock shall be made, the definition set forth above shall control.
 
"Disability" means that Executive (i) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (ii) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than 3 months under an accident and health plan, or disability plan, covering employees of the company or an Affiliate of the Company.
"Good Reason" means the occurrence, without the express prior written consent of Executive, of any of the following events: (i) the failure by the Company to pay the Executive any portion of Executive's Base Compensation within ten (10) days of the date such compensation is due, (ii) the relocation of Executive's principal location of employment, to a location outside a fifty (50) mile radius from Long Beach, California, (iii) any material diminution of Executive's duties, responsibilities or authorities hereunder, (iv) any material breach by the Company of any of its material obligations to Executive, or (v) any failure of the Company to obtain the assumption in writing of its obligations under this Agreement by any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets within 30 days after any reconstruction, amalgamation, combination, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, unless such assumption occurs by operation of law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Good Reason" to terminate Executive's employment shall not exist unless (a) a written notice has first been delivered to the Board by Executive (the "Good Reason Notice"), which Good Reason Notice (1) specifically identifies the event(s) Executive believes constitutes Good Reason and (2) provides 30 days from the date of such Good Reason Notice for the Company to cure such circumstances (the "Good Reason Period") and (b) the Company has failed to timely cure such circumstances.  If the Company fails to timely cure such circumstances in accordance with the foregoing, Executive may send a notice to the Board that he is terminating his employment for Good Reason ("Good Reason Termination Notice"), in which case his employment hereunder shall thereupon be terminated for Good Reason.  If any Good Reason Notice to the Board shall not have been delivered by Executive within ninety (90) days following the date Executive becomes aware of the purported existence of a Good Reason event, or any Good Reason Termination Notice to the Board shall not have been delivered by Executive within thirty (30) days following the end of the Good Reason Period, then any purported termination of Executive's employment relating to the applicable event shall not be a termination for Good Reason under this Agreement.
 
As used herein, a "Separation from Service" occurs when Executive dies, retires, or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company that constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(1), without regard to the optional alternative definitions available thereunder.
 
.  Upon a termination of Executive's employment hereunder, unless requested otherwise by the Company, Executive shall resign each position (if any) that Executive then holds as an officer of the Company or as an officer or director of any of their Affiliates.
g)
                                   
Resignation as Officer or Director
 
.  The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement shall not result in the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of any payments under this Agreement which are subject to Section 409A of the Code until the Executive has incurred a "separation from service" from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding

To the extent required in order to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, amounts reimbursable to Executive under this Agreement shall be paid to Executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in kind benefits provided to Executive) during one year may not affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year.  The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments described in this Agreement will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to any such payment.
 
.  Executive acknowledges that during the period of his employment with the Company or any Affiliate, he shall have access to the Company's "Confidential Information" (as defined below) and will meet and develop relationships with the Company's potential and existing suppliers, financing sources, clients, customers and employees. Accordingly, Executive agrees to the following provisions of this Section 6 (in addition to Executive's confidentiality obligations to the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Company's policies as in effect from time to time).

Executive agrees and acknowledges that a portion of the compensation paid to Executive under this Agreement will be paid in consideration of the covenants contained in this Section 6, the sufficiency of which consideration is hereby acknowledged.  If any provision of this Section 6 as applied to Executive or to any circumstance is adjudged by a court with jurisdiction upon short notice to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall in no way affect any other circumstance or the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this Section 6.  If the scope of any such provision, or any part thereof, is too broad to permit enforcement of such provision to its full extent, Executive agrees that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration and/or area of such provision, and/or to delete specific words or phrases, and in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.  Executive agrees and acknowledges that the breach of this Section 6 will cause irreparable injury to the Company and upon breach of any provision of this Section 6, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief by any court with jurisdiction upon short notice; provided, however, that this shall in no way limit any other remedies which the Company may have (including, without limitation, the right to seek monetary damages).

ARBITRATION
 
If any legally actionable dispute arises which cannot be resolved by mutual discussion between the parties, each of Executive and the Company agree to resolve that dispute by arbitration before an arbitrator experienced in employment law.  Said arbitration will be conducted pursuant to the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures and applicable California law.  The parties agree that this arbitration agreement includes any such disputes that the Company and its related entities may have against Executive, or Executive may have against the Company and/or its related entities and/or employees, arising out of or relating to Executive's employment or its termination including any claims of discrimination or harassment in violation of applicable law and any other aspect of Executive's compensation, training, employment, or its termination.
a)
                                   
The parties further agree that this arbitration provision is the exclusive and binding remedy for any such dispute and will be used instead of any court action, which is hereby expressly waived, except for any request by either party for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief pending arbitration in accordance with applicable law or an administrative claim with an administrative agency.  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY.
b)
                                  
 
The parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in Los Angeles County, California, unless otherwise mutually agreed.
c)
                                   
 
The provisions of Section 1281.8 of the California Code of Civil Procedure with respect to provisional remedies will apply to any such arbitration.  In any such arbitration proceeding, any hearing must be transcribed by a certified court reporter and the arbitrator's decision must be set forth in writing, consistent with the law of California and supported by essential findings of fact and conclusion of law.  The arbitrator may issue any remedy or award available under applicable law but may not add to, modify, change or disregard any lawful terms of this Agreement or issue an award or remedy that is contrary to the law of California.  The parties further agree that each party shall pay its own costs and attorneys' fees, if any; provided, however, the Company shall pay any costs and expenses that Employee would not otherwise have incurred if the dispute had been adjudicated in a court of law, rather than through arbitration, including the arbitrator's fee, any administrative fee, and any filing fee in excess of the maximum court filing fee in the jurisdiction in which the arbitration is commenced.  If either party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party an award of attorneys' fees, then the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party, consistent with applicable law.
d)
                                  
 
.  Each party represents and warrants that (a) such party is not subject to any contract, arrangement, agreement, policy or understanding, or to any statute, governmental rule or regulation, that in any way limits such party's ability to enter into and fully perform such party's obligations under this Agreement; (b) such party is not otherwise unable to enter into and fully perform such party's obligations under this Agreement; and (c) upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by both parties, this Agreement shall be such party's valid and binding obligation, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

REPRESENTATIONS
 
.  In the event of any inconsistency between any provision of this Agreement and any provision of any other Company arrangement, the provisions of this Agreement shall control to the extent more favorable to Executive unless Executive otherwise agrees in a writing that expressly refers to the provision of this Agreement whose control he is waiving.
11.
                           
INCONSISTENCIES
.  Executive shall be entitled, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to select and change a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder following Executive's death by giving written notice thereof.  In the event of Executive's death or a judicial determination of his incompetence, references in this Agreement to Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his beneficiary, estate or other legal representative.
