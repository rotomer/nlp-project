Consent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
HCP is also filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to amend Exhibit 23.2 (the "Original Exhibit 23.2") to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 filed on February 14, 2012 (the "2011 Form 10-K"). HCP's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP (the "Firm"), consented to the use of their reports dated February 14, 2012 that are included in the 2011 Form 10-K.

This Amendment makes no attempt to reflect events occurring after the filing of the 2011 Form 10-K and does not change any previously reported financial results of operations or any disclosures contained in that document, other than an updated Exhibit 23.2.
