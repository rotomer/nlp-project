Such registration statement covers the registration of the Securities (among others) under the 1933 Act.  Such registration statement, in the form in which it became effective, as amended through the date hereof, including the information deemed pursuant to Rule 430B under the 1933 Act Regulations to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness ("Rule 430B Information") and all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein through the date hereof, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement."

The term "Pre-Pricing Prospectus," as used in this Agreement, means the preliminary prospectus supplement dated March 21, 2012 and filed with the Commission on March 22, 2012 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, together with the Base Prospectus used with such preliminary prospectus supplement in connection with the marketing of the Securities, in each case as amended or supplemented by the Company.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Agreement to documents, financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included," "stated," "described in" or "referred to" in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus (and all other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such documents, financial statements and schedules and other information which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), after the date of this Agreement which is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.

Indemnification of the Underwriter
 
(i)                against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information or any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h) under the 1933 Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(a) under the 1933 Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii)               against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii)              against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 6(c) hereof, the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by you), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided

however
 
(b)   .  The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus or any Pre-Pricing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by you expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of the Company, Directors and Officers
 
(c)   .  Each indemnified party shall give written notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by you, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

provided
however
 
(d)   .  If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
 
(e)   .  For purposes of this Section 6, all references to the Registration Statement, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, shall be deemed to include, without limitation, any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR.

Section 7.        .  If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of you, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions that the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriter.
 
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by you and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, you shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by you were offered exceeds the amount of any damages which you have otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each agent of the Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Section 8.        .  All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriter.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery

Termination
 
(a)   The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (and, if any Option Securities are to be purchased on a Date of Delivery which occurs after the Closing Time, the Underwriter may terminate the obligation to purchase such Securities, by notice to the Company, at any time on or prior to such Date of Delivery) (i) if there has been since the date of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States, any outbreak of hostilities or other calamity or crisis or change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Underwriter, impracticable to market the Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the NASDAQ Global Market has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by the NASDAQ Global Market or by order of the Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or any other governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance
 
services in the United States, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either federal, New York, Maryland or California authorities.  As used in this Section 9(a), the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities.
 
(b)   If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof.  Notwithstanding any such termination, the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 7 and 8 shall remain in effect.
 
Section 10.      .  The Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that:
Certain Agreements of the Underwriter

(b)   It is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the 1933 Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the Prospectus Delivery Period).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as Maryland corporate counsel to the Company in connection with the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), under the Registration Statement, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on or about September 4, 2009.  You have requested our opinion with respect to the matters set forth below.
 
In our capacity as Maryland corporate counsel to the Company and for the purposes of this opinion, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents (collectively, the "Documents"):

Offering Documents
 
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Offering Documents and such other documentation and information provided to us by you as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein.
 
In addition, you have provided us with, and we are relying upon, a certificate containing certain factual statements, factual representations and covenants of officers of HCP (the "") relating to, among other things, the actual and proposed operations of HCP and the entities in which it holds, or has held, a direct or indirect interest (collectively, the ""). These representations and covenants relate, in some cases, to transactions and investments for which we did not act as the Company's primary counsel. For purposes of our opinion, we have not independently verified all of the facts, statements, representations and covenants set forth in the Officers' Certificate, the Offering Documents or in any other document. In particular, we note that the Company may engage in transactions in which we have not provided legal advice, and have not reviewed, and of which we may be unaware. We have, consequently, assumed and relied on your representation that the statements, representations and covenants contained in the Officers' Certificate, the Offering Documents, and other documents, or otherwise furnished to us, accurately and completely describe all material facts relevant to our opinion. We have assumed that such facts, statements, representations and covenants are true without regard to any qualification as to knowledge, belief, intent or materiality.
Officers' Certificate
Company
 
Our opinion is conditioned on the continuing accuracy and completeness of such facts, statements, representations and covenants. We are not aware of any facts inconsistent with such statements, representations and covenants. We have, at the Company's request, also assumed for purposes of our opinion that any legal opinion received by the Company on or before November 8, 2010, to the effect that the Company was taxable as a real estate investment trust (a "") under Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), is correct. Any material change or inaccuracy in the facts referred to, set forth or assumed herein or in the Officers' Certificate, including the correctness of any such prior legal opinion, may affect our conclusions set forth herein.

In our review of certain documents in connection with our opinion as expressed below, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic or electronic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. Where documents have been provided to us in draft form, we have assumed that the final executed versions of such documents will not differ materially from such drafts.
 
Our opinion is also based on the correctness of the following assumptions: (i) HCP and each of the entities comprising the Company has been and will continue to be operated in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was formed and in the manner described in the relevant organizational documents,
(ii) there will be no changes in the applicable laws of the State of Maryland or of any other jurisdiction under the laws of which any of the entities comprising the Company have been formed and (iii) each of the written agreements to which the Company is a party has been and will be implemented, construed and enforced in accordance with its terms.
 
In rendering our opinion, we have considered and relied upon the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder (""), administrative rulings and other Treasury interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the Internal Revenue Service (""), all as they exist at the date hereof. It should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect. A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our conclusions set forth herein. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel's best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position if asserted by the IRS.
Regulations
IRS
 
We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States. We express no opinion on any issue relating to HCP or any investment therein, other than as expressly stated herein.
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, commencing with HCP's taxable year that ended on December 31, 1985, HCP has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation through the date of this letter has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will continue to enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code thereafter. As noted in the Offering Documents, HCP's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual operating results, certain requirements relating to the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and various other qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of HCP's operation for any one taxable year will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
 
This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the Offering.  We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form 8-K, filed with the Commission on March 27, 2012 and to the reference to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP under the caption "Supplemental Material United States
 
Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.
