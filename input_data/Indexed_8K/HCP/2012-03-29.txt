The Amendment, among other things, reduces (i) the applicable margin rates on the revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement, so that the loans outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.85%, and (ii) the applicable facility fee rates, which the Company is obligated to pay on the aggregate amount of the revolving commitments, to a rate per annum ranging from 0.15% to 0.45%, in each case based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt ratings.
 
The Amendment also extends the maturity date of the revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement by one year from March 11, 2015 to March 11, 2016.  Other terms of the Credit Agreement were substantially unchanged, including a one-year extension option at the Company's discretion, and the ability to increase the commitments by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, subject to customary conditions.
 
Certain of the lenders party to the Amendment and their respective affiliates engage in financial advisory, investment banking, commercial banking or other transactions of a financial nature with the Company and its subsidiaries, including the provision of advisory services for which they receive certain fees, expense reimbursements or other payments.
 
The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amendment, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
