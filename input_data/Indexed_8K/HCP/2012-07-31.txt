LONG BEACH, CA, July 31, 2012  HCP (the "Company" or "we") (NYSE:HCP) announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
 
 
Operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 include the positive impact of $0.02 per share resulting from a $7 million insurance recovery of past G&A expenses. In addition to the merger-related items disclosed above, operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 include the positive impact of $0.10 per share for the following: (i) interest income of $0.09 per share or $35 million from the early payoff of our Genesis debt investments; and (ii) other income of $0.01 per share or $6 million received in connection with a litigation settlement that represents proceeds owed to the Company from a prior sale of assets.
 
FFO, FFO as adjusted and FAD are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that the Company believes are useful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts. See the "Funds From Operations" section of this release for additional information regarding FFO and FFO as adjusted and the "Funds Available for Distribution" section of this release for additional information regarding FAD.
 
INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
 
On June 28, 2012, we made an investment in senior unsecured notes with an aggregate par value of 138.5 million at a discount for 136.8 million (approximately $215 million), as part of the financing for Terra Firma's 825 million acquisition of Four Seasons Health Care ("Four Seasons"), the largest elderly and specialist care provider in the United Kingdom with 445 care homes and 61 specialist care centers. The notes mature in June 2020 and are non-callable until June 2016. The notes bear interest on their par value at a fixed rate of 12.25% per annum, with an original discount resulting in a yield to maturity of 12.5%. Terra Firma, a leading European private equity firm, provided 345 million in equity financing, resulting in a loan-to-capitalization of 62% for the Four Seasons notes. The 136.8 million for this investment is funded by a GBP denominated term loan that serves as a natural hedge and is discussed below.
 
During the quarter, we made additional investments of $70 million as follows: (i) acquisition of a life science facility for $8 million; (ii) acquisition of a parcel of land adjacent to one of our hospitals for $3 million; and (iii) funding of development and other capital projects of $59 million, primarily in our life science, medical office and senior housing segments.
 
On July 30, 2012, we acquired an 80,000 sq. ft. on-campus medical office building ("MOB") for $14 million.
 
On July 30, 2012, we executed agreements to acquire eight on-campus MOBs for $81 million from Scottsdale Healthcare. The eight on-campus MOBs located in Scottsdale, Arizona comprise approximately 398,000 rentable sq. ft. and have a current occupancy of 89%.  We expect to close this acquisition early August 2012.
 
On July 30, 2012, we executed agreements to acquire a portfolio of 12 MOBs from The Boyer Company valued at $179 million, including non-managing member LLC units ("DownREIT units") and debt valued at $41 million and $59 million, respectively; the MOBs are primarily located on the campuses of HCA, Iasis Healthcare and Community Health Systems and comprise 758,000 sq. ft. with a current occupancy of 88%. We expect to close this acquisition on or before August 31, 2012.
 
FINANCING ACTIVITY
 
In June 2012, we completed a $376 million offering of 8.97 million shares of common stock at $41.88 per share.
 
On July 23, 2012, we issued $300 million of 3.15% senior unsecured notes due in 2022. The notes were priced at 98.888% of the principal amount with an effective yield to maturity of 3.28%. Net proceeds from this offering were $293.7 million.
 
On July 30, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a 137 million four-year unsecured term loan (the "Loan") that accrues interest at a rate of GBP LIBOR plus 1.20%. Concurrent with the closing of the Loan, we entered into a four-year interest rate swap agreement that fixes the rate of the Loan at 1.81%, subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings.
 
SUSTAINABILITY
 
During the quarter, we earned seven ENERGY STAR awards in our senior housing (4), life science (2) and medical office (1) segments and achieved Platinum LEED status on one of our recently completed life science redevelopment properties in San Diego as a result of the Company's energy conservation programs. As of June 30, 2012, our medical office, life science and senior housing segments have been awarded 75 ENERGY STAR labels. Further, in June 2012, we completed our first response to the Carbon Disclosure Project's 2012 Investor questionnaire as well as our response to the 2012 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark survey sponsored by NAREIT. More information about HCP's sustainability efforts can be found on our website at .

DIVIDEND
 
On July 26, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per common share. The dividend will be paid on August 21, 2012 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 6, 2012.
OUTLOOK
 
For the full year 2012, we expect FFO applicable to common shares to range between $2.70 and $2.76 per share; FFO as adjusted applicable to common shares to range between $2.73 and $2.79 per share; FAD applicable to common shares to range between $2.18 and $2.24 per share; and net income applicable to common shares to range between $1.83 and $1.89 per share. See the "Projected Future Operations" section of this release for additional information regarding these estimates.

Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of acquired above/below market lease intangibles, net; (ii) amortization of deferred compensation expense; (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net; (iv) straight-line rents; (v) accretion and depreciation related to DFLs; and (vi) deferred revenues. Further, FAD is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and includes similar adjustments to compute the Company's share of FAD from its unconsolidated joint ventures. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating FAD, and accordingly, our FAD may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although our FAD computation may not be comparable to that of other REITs, management believes FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our ability to fund its ongoing dividend payments. In addition, management believes that in order to further understand and analyze our liquidity, FAD should be compared with cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP and presented in its consolidated financial statements. FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of our liquidity.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, DFL accretion reflects an elimination of $14.8 million and $29.5 million, respectively. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, DFL accretion reflects an elimination of $13.3 million. Our ownership interest in HCR ManorCare OpCo is accounted for using the equity method, which requires an ongoing elimination of DFL income that is proportional to our ownership in HCR ManorCare OpCo. Further, our share of earnings from HCR ManorCare OpCo (equity income) increases for the corresponding elimination of related lease expense recognized at the HCR ManorCare OpCo level, which we present as a non-cash joint venture FAD adjustment.
 
 
(1)
    
We believe Net Operating Income from Continuing Operations ("NOI") provides investors relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and adjusted NOI to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable
GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) since it excludes certain components from net income. Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
 
NOI is defined as rental and related revenues, including tenant recoveries, resident fees and services, and income from DFLs, less property level operating expenses. NOI excludes interest income, investment management fee income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, litigation settlement, impairments, impairment recoveries, other income, net, income taxes, equity income from and impairments of unconsolidated joint ventures, and discontinued operations. Adjusted NOI is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL accretion, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. Adjusted NOI is sometimes referred to as "cash NOI."

Same property portfolio ("SPP")
statistics allow management to evaluate the performance of the Company's real estate portfolio under a consistent population, which eliminates the changes in the composition of the Company's portfolio of properties. The Company identifies its SPP as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or operating properties (RIDEA) for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods presented. Accordingly, it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in the Company's SPP. SPP NOI excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.

Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage.
  Adjusted EBITDA divided by Fixed Charges. The Company uses Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage provides investors, particularly fixed income investors, relevant and useful information because it measures the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. The Company's various debt agreements contain covenants that require the Company to maintain ratios similar to Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage, and credit rating agencies utilize similar ratios in evaluating and determining the credit rating on certain debt instruments of the Company. However, since this ratio is derived from Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges, its usefulness is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges. Further, the Company's computation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage may not be comparable to similar fixed charge coverage ratios reported by other companies.
The Company has provided reconciliations of this measure to the most comparable GAAP measure in this supplemental information package and for certain historical trend information on page 6, such reconciliations are available in the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC dated February 14, 2012 (2011 metrics), February 15, 2011 (2010 metrics), February 12, 2010 (2009 metrics), February 10, 2009 (2008 metrics), February 11, 2008 (2008 and 2007 metrics) and July 30, 2007 (Pre-CNL Acquisition metrics).
 
The following table details the calculation of Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Annualized Revenues.
  The most recent month's (or subsequent month's if acquired in the most recent month) base rent including additional rent floors, cash income from direct financing leases and/or interest income annualized for 12 months. Annualized Revenues for operating properties under a RIDEA structure are calculated based on the most recent monthly NOI annualized for 12 months. Annualized Revenues do not include tenant recoveries, additional rents in excess of floors and non-cash revenue adjustments (i.e., straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, DFL interest accretion and deferred revenues). The Company uses Annualized Revenues for the purpose of determining Operator/Tenant Diversification, Lease Expirations and Debt Investment Maturities.
 
Assets Held for Sale
.
  Assets of discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 360.
 
Assisted Living Facility ("ALF"). 
A senior housing facility that predominantly consists of assisted living units is classified by the Company as an ALF.
 
Cash Flow Coverage ("CFC"). 
Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM for the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date reported divided by the Same Period Rent. Cash Flow Coverage is a supplemental measure of a property's ability to generate cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of Facility EBITDAR or Facility EBITDARM. The coverages shown exclude newly completed facilities under start-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.
 
Consolidated Assets.
  Total assets as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Consolidated Debt.
  The carrying amount of bank line of credit, bridge and term loans (if applicable), senior unsecured notes, mortgage and other secured debt, and other debt as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Consolidated Gross Assets.
  The carrying amount of total assets, excluding investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization, as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Consolidated Secured Debt.
  Mortgage and other debt secured by real estate, excluding debt on assets held for sale as reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
Continuing Care Retirement Community ("CCRC"). 
A senior housing facility which provides at least three levels of care (i.e., independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing) is classified by the Company as a CCRC.
 
Debt Investments.
  Loans secured by a direct interest in real estate and mezzanine loans.
 
Debt Service
. 
The periodic payment of interest expense and principal amortization on secured loans.
 
Development.
  Includes ground-up construction and redevelopments.
 
Direct Financing Lease ("DFL").
  The Company uses the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield.
 
Estimated Completion Date.
 
For development projects, management's estimate of the date the core and shell structure improvements are expected to be or have been completed. For redevelopment projects, management's estimate of the time in which major construction activity in relation to the scope of the project has been substantially completed.
 
 
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
 The real estate industry uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding impairments, gains or losses from real estate dispositions, and litigation settlement charge. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure both its operating performance and liquidity. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from its operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, impairments, impairment recoveries, and gains or losses from real estate dispositions. By excluding interest expense, Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure the Company's operating performance independent of its capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of its operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare its operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. As a liquidity measure, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help investors analyze the Company's ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt and to make preferred dividend payments. The Company believes investors should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with net income (the primary measure of the Company's performance) and the other required GAAP measures of its performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of the Company's operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of its performance between periods and against other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should be used in conjunction with the Company's required GAAP presentations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company's historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity. Further, the Company's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
 
The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA from net income (in thousands):
 
 
Facility EBITDAR ("EBITDAR").
  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company), for the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date reported. The Company uses Facility EBITDAR in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage. Facility EBITDAR has limitations as an analytical tool.  Facility EBITDAR does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, Facility EBITDAR does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management. The Company utilizes Facility EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company. Facility EBITDAR includes the greater of (i) contractual management fees or (ii) an imputed management fee of 5% for senior housing facilities and post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and 2% for acute care hospitals which the Company believes represents typical management fees in their respective industries. All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
 
Facility EBITDA
R
M ("EBITDA
R
M").
  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company
), for the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date reported.  The Company uses Facility EBITDARM in determining Cash Flow Coverage and Debt Service Coverage. Facility EBITDARM has limitations as an analytical tool. Facility EBITDARM does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, Facility EBITDARM does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. However, the Company receives periodic financial information from operators/tenants regarding the performance of the Company's facilities under the operator's/tenant's management. The Company utilizes Facility EBITDARM as a supplemental measure of the ability of those properties to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company. All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company.
Financial Leverage.
 
Total Debt divided by Total Gross Assets. The Company believes that its Financial Leverage is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. The Company believes that the ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Gross Assets is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Financial Leverage. The Company's computation of its Financial Leverage may not be identical to the computations of financial leverage reported by other companies. The Company's pro rata share of total debt from the Investment Management Platform is not intended to reflect its actual liability or ability to access assets should there be a default under any or all such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. The Company has provided reconciliations of this measure to the most comparable GAAP measure in this supplemental information package and for certain historical trend information on page 6, such reconciliations are available in the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC dated February 14, 2012 (2011 metrics), February 15, 2011 (2010 metrics), February 12, 2010 (2009 metrics), February 10, 2009 (2008 metrics), February 11, 2008 (2008 and 2007 metrics) and July 30, 2007 (Pre-CNL Acquisition metrics).
 
Fixed Charges.
 Total interest expense plus capitalized interest plus preferred stock dividends. The Company uses Fixed Charges to measure its interest payments on outstanding debt and dividends to its preferred stockholders for purposes of presenting Fixed Charge Coverage and Adjusted Fixed Charge Coverage. However, the usefulness of Fixed Charges is limited as, among other things, it does not include all contractual obligations.  The Company's computation of Fixed Charges should not be considered an alternative to fixed charges as defined by Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K and may not be comparable to fixed charges reported by other companies.
 
Funds Available for Distribution ("FAD").
  Funds Available for Distribution is defined as FFO as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following: (i) amortization of acquired above/below market lease intangibles, net; (ii) amortization of deferred compensation expense; (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs, net; (iv) straight-line rents; (v) accretion and depreciation related to DFLs; and (vi) deferred revenues. Further, FAD is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures, including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements, and includes similar adjustments to compute the Company's share of FAD from its unconsolidated joint ventures. Other real estate investment trusts ("REITs") or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating FAD, and accordingly, the Company's FAD may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although the Company's FAD computation may not be comparable to that of other REITs, management believes FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of the Company's ability to fund its ongoing dividend payments. In addition, management believes that in order to further understand and analyze the Company's liquidity, FAD should be compared with cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP and presented in its consolidated financial statements. FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company's performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company's liquidity.
 
Funds From Operations ("FFO").
  The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.  The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), FFO applicable to common shares, Diluted FFO applicable to common shares, and Basic and Diluted FFO per common share are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT.  Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.  Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REIT that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP.  FFO is defined as net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from acquisition and dispositions of depreciable real estate or related interests, impairments of, or related to, depreciable real estate, plus real estate and DFL depreciation and amortization, with adjustments to derive the Company's pro rata share of FFO from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. The Company considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate and DFL depreciation and amortization, FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a REIT between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of REITs, it does not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company's real estate assets, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's future cash requirements. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently from the Company.
For a reconciliation of FFO to net income, please refer to the slide in this supplemental information package captioned "Consolidated Funds From Operations."
 
FFO as adjusted represents FFO before the impact of litigation settlement charges, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments (recoveries) of non-depreciable assets and merger-related items. Merger-related items include estimated acquisition pursuit costs that consist primarily of professional fees and the impact of common stock offerings which increase the weighted average shares outstanding, when such proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration of the Company's pending acquisitions. Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP).
 
FAD Payout Ratio.
  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FAD per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FAD Payout Ratio per Common Share provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FAD being declared as dividends to common stockholders.  FAD Payout Ratio per Common Share is subject to the same limitations noted in the definition of FAD above.
 
FFO Payout Ratio.
  Dividends declared per common share divided by Diluted FFO per common share for a given period.  The Company believes the FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the portion of FFO being declared as dividends to common stockholders.  FFO Payout Ratio per Common Share is subject to the same limitations noted in the definition of FFO above.
HCP Life Science.

HCP Life Science includes the following partnerships: (i) Torrey Pines Science Center LP (50%), (ii) Britannia Biotech Gateway LP (55%) and (iii) LASDK LP (63%).  The unconsolidated joint ventures were acquired as part of the Company's purchase of Slough Estates USA Inc. on August 1, 2007.

  A non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties and SPP. The Company defines NOI as rental and related revenues, including tenant recoveries, resident fees and services, and income from DFLs, less property level operating expenses. NOI excludes interest income, investment management fee income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, litigation settlement, impairments, impairment recoveries, other income, net, income taxes, equity income from and impairments of unconsolidated joint ventures, and discontinued operations. The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis. Adjusted NOI is calculated as NOI eliminating the effects of straight-line rents, DFL accretion, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, and lease termination fees. Adjusted NOI is sometimes referred to as "cash NOI." The Company uses NOI and adjusted NOI to make decisions about resource allocations, to assess and compare property level performance, and evaluate SPP. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items. Further, NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.
 
The following table reconciles NOI from net income (in thousands):
 
 
 
Occupancy
.
  For life science facilities and medical office buildings, occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased where rental payments have commenced, including month-to-month leases, as of the end of the period reported. For senior housing facilities, post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, occupancy represents the facilities' average operating occupancy for the trailing three-month and 12-month periods and one quarter in arrears from the date reported. The percentages are calculated based on units, licensed beds and available beds for senior housing facilities, post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, respectively. The percentages shown exclude newly completed facilities under lease-up, vacant facilities and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. All facility financial performance data was derived solely from information provided by operators/tenants and borrowers without independent verification by the Company. For the SPP, occupancy for senior housing facilities, post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are presented based on the average operating occupancy for the trailing three-month and 12-month periods and one quarter in arrears from the date reported.
 
Owned Portfolio.
  Represents owned properties subject to operating leases and DFLs, properties operated under a RIDEA structure and debt investments, and excludes properties under development, including redevelopment, land held for development and real estate owned by the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures.
 
 
Pooled Leases.
  Two or more leases to the same operator/tenant or their subsidiaries under which their obligations are combined by virtue of a master lease or multiple master leases, a pooling agreement or multiple pooling agreements, or cross-guaranties. For example, Sunrise Senior Living percentage pooled consists of 47 assets under 6 separate pools.
 
Quality Mix. 
Represents non-Medicaid revenues as a percent of total revenues for the trailing 12 months and is one quarter in arrears from the period presented.
 
Redevelopment Projects.
  Properties that require significant capital expenditures (generally more than 25% of acquisition cost or existing basis) to achieve stabilization or to change the use of the properties.
 
Rehabilitation Hospitals ("Rehab").
  Rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses, such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, head injuries, orthopedic problems, work-related disabilities and neurological diseases.
 
Rental and RIDEA Revenues.
  Represents rental and related revenues, tenant recoveries, resident fees and services, and
income from direct financing leases.
 
Retention Rate.
  Represents the ratio of total renewed square feet to the total square feet expiring and available for lease, excluding the square feet for tenant leases terminated for default or buy-out prior to the expiration of their lease
.
 
RIDEA.
  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as "RIDEA")
.
 
Same Period Rent.
  The base rent plus additional rent due to the Company over the trailing 12 months and one quarter in arrears from the date reported.  The Company uses Same Period Rent for purposes of determining property-level Cash Flow Coverage.
 
Same Property Portfolio ("SPP").
  SPP statistics allow management to evaluate the performance of the Company's real estate portfolio under a consistent population, which eliminates the changes in the composition of the Company's portfolio of properties. The Company identifies its SPP as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or operating properties (RIDEA) for the duration of the year-over-year comparison periods presented. Accordingly, it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in the Company's SPP. SPP NOI excludes certain non-property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis.
 
Secured Debt Ratio.
 
Total Secured Debt divided by Total Gross Assets. The Company believes that its Secured Debt Ratio is a meaningful supplemental measure of its financial position, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. The Company believes that the ratio of Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated Gross Assets is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Secured Debt Ratio. The Company's computation of its Secured Debt Ratio may not be identical to the computations of Secured Debt Ratio reported by other companies. The Company's pro rata share of total secured debt from the Investment Management Platform is not intended to reflect its actual liability or ability to access assets should there be a default under any or all such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. The Company has provided reconciliations of this measure to the most comparable GAAP measure in this supplemental information package and for certain historical trend information on page 6, such reconciliations are available in the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC dated February 14, 2012 (2011 metrics), February 15, 2011 (2010 metrics), February 12, 2010 (2009 metrics), February 10, 2009 (2008 metrics), February 11, 2008 (2008 and 2007 metrics) and July 30, 2007 (Pre-CNL Acquisition metrics).
 
Senior Housing.
  ALFs, ILFs and CCRCs.
 
Specialty Hospitals.
  Specialty hospitals are licensed as acute care hospitals but focus on providing care in specific areas such as cardiac, orthopedic and women's conditions, or specific procedures such as surgery, and are less likely to provide emergency services.
 
Square Feet.
  The square footage for properties, excluding square footage for development or redevelopment properties prior to completion.
 
Stabilized.
  Newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease up (typically when the tenant(s) controls the physical use of 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. Newly completed developments, including redevelopments, are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service.
 
Total Debt. 
Consolidated Debt at book value plus the Company's pro rata share of total debt from the Investment Management Platform.
 
Total Gross Assets.
  Consolidated Gross Assets plus the Company's pro rata share of total assets from the Investment Management Platform, after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization.
 
The following table details the calculation of Total Gross Assets (in thousands):
 
 
 
 
(1)
     
Reflects the Company's pro rata share of amounts from the Investment Management Platform and its equity interest in HCR ManorCare OpCo.
 
Total Market Capitalization.
  Total Debt plus Total Market Equity.
 
Total Market Equity.
  The total number of outstanding shares of the Company's common stock multiplied by the closing price per share of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end, plus the total number of convertible partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end (adjusted for stock splits), plus the total number of outstanding shares of the Company's preferred stock multiplied by the closing price of its preferred stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of period end.
 
Total Secured Debt.
 Consolidated Secured Debt plus the Company's pro rata share of mortgage debt from the Investment Management Platform.
 
Units/Square Feet/Beds.
  Senior housing facilities are measured in units (e.g., studio, one or two bedroom units). Life science facilities and medical office buildings are measured in square feet. Post-acute/skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are measured in licensed bed count.
 
Yield.
 Yield is calculated as Net Operating Income, as adjusted, divided by Investment.  For acquisitions, initial yields are calculated as projected Net Operating Income, 12 months forward, as adjusted, as of the closing date divided by total acquisition cost basis.  The total acquisition cost basis includes the initial purchase price, the effects of adjusting assumed debt to market, lease intangible adjustments and all transaction costs.
