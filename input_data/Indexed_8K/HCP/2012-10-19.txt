Indemnification of the Underwriter
 
(i)            against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information or any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h) under the 1933 Act) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(a) under the 1933 Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii)           against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii)          against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 6(c) hereof, the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by you), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
 
provided
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by you expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus or any Pre-Pricing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or made in reliance upon the Trustee's Form T-1 filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
however
 
(b)   .  The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus or any Pre-Pricing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by you expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of the Company, Directors and Officers
 
(c)   .  Each indemnified party shall give written notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by you, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.  An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action;
Actions Against Parties; Notification
 
provided
, , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party.  In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
however
 
(d)   .  If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
(e)   .  For purposes of this Section 6, all references to the Registration Statement, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, shall be deemed to include, without limitation, any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR.

Section 7.       
Contribution
.  If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of you, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as (i) the total net proceeds from the offering of
 
the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bears to (ii) the difference between (x) the aggregate price to the public received by the Underwriter and (y) the aggregate price paid by the Underwriter to the Company for the Securities.
 
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by you and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, you shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by you were offered exceeds the amount of any damages which you have otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each agent of the Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Section 8.       
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
.  All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriter.

Termination

As used in this Section 9(a), the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities.
 
(b)

HCP, Inc. Public Offering of Common Stock
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to HCP, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement, dated October 16, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between you, as underwriter, and the Company, relating to the sale by the Company to you of 22,000,000 shares (the "Firm Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Stock"), and up to an additional 3,300,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option Shares") pursuant to your option to purchase such Option Shares.  The Firm Shares and the Option Shares are collectively referred to herein as the "Securities."
 
This letter is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(b)(1) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In the above capacity, we have reviewed the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-182824) of the Company relating to the Securities and other securities of the Company filed on July 24, 2012 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the "Rules and Regulations"), including the Incorporated Documents (as defined below) and the information deemed to be a part of the registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B of the Rules and Regulations (such registration statement, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement"), and (i) the prospectus, dated July 24, 2012 (the "Base Prospectus"), which forms a part of and is included in the Registration Statement, (ii) the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated October 16, 2012 (together with the Base Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, the "Preliminary Prospectus"), relating to the offering of the Securities in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations, and (iii) the prospectus supplement, dated October 16, 2012 (the "Prospectus Supplement" and, together with the Base Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, the "Prospectus"), relating to the offering of the Securities in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations.  We also have reviewed the documents identified on hereto filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and incorporated by reference into the Prospectus or the Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be, as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Incorporated Documents") and such other documents
Schedule A
as we deemed appropriate.  Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 1(a)(xxiii) and in both the first and third sentences of Section 1(a)(iv) of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement became effective upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462 of the Rules and Regulations, and we have been orally advised by the Commission that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to our knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
 
In addition, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, Maryland counsel for the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accountants of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accountants of HCR Properties, LLC, representatives of the Underwriters and counsel at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package (as defined below) and related matters were discussed.  We did not participate in the preparation of the Incorporated Documents, but have, however, reviewed such documents and discussed the business and affairs of the Company with officers and other representatives of the Company.  We do not pass upon, or assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package and have made no independent check or verification thereof (except to the extent referred to in paragraph 4 of our corporate opinion to you and paragraph 2 of our tax opinion to you, each dated the date hereof).
 
On the basis of the foregoing, (i) the Registration Statement, at the Effective Time (as defined below), the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, and the Incorporated Documents, each as of its respective filing date, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the Rules and Regulations (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1")) and (ii) no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the Registration Statement, at the Effective Time,contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading(except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or the auditors' report on internal controls over financial reporting, or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).  In addition, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time (as defined below), contained an
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading(except that we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or the auditors' report on internal controls over financial reporting, or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).
 
As used herein, (i) "Effective Time" means the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act, as such section applies to you, (ii) "Applicable Time" means 4:30 p.m. (Eastern time) on October 16, 2012, which you advised us is the time of the first contract of sale of the Securities, and (iii) "General Disclosure Package" means the Preliminary Prospectus and the information included on Exhibit B to the Underwriting Agreement, all considered together.
 
In addition, based on the foregoing, we confirm to you that (i) the Prospectus Supplement has been filed with the Commission within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without recourse to Rule 424(b)(8)) of the Rules and Regulations, and (ii) any required filing of "issuer free writing prospectuses" pursuant to Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations has been filed with the Commission within the time period required by Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations.

Certain United States Federal Income Tax Matters
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
You have requested our opinion concerning certain United States Federal income tax considerations in connection with the offering (the "") of up to 22,000,000 shares of common stock (the "") by HCP, Inc., a Maryland corporation (""), pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-182824), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "") on July 24, 2012 (together with the prospectus filed therewith, the ""), a preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the Commission on October 16, 2012 (the "") and a prospectus supplement filed with the Commission on October 18, 2012 (the "", and collectively with the Registration Statement and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the "").  We have acted as tax counsel to HCP in connection with, and have participated in the preparation of, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement.  This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(b)(1) of the Underwriting Agreement dated as of October 16, 2012 (the ""), by and between HCP and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as underwriter.  Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.

In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Offering Documents and such other documentation and information provided to us by HCP as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein.  In addition, HCP has provided us with, and we are relying upon, a certificate containing certain factual statements, factual representations and covenants of officers of HCP (the "") relating to, among other things, the actual and proposed operations of HCP and the entities in which it holds, or has held, a direct or indirect interest (collectively, the "").  These representations and covenants relate, in some cases, to transactions and investments for which we did not act as the Company's primary counsel.  For purposes of our opinion, we have not independently verified all of the facts, statements, representations and covenants set forth in the Officers' Certificate, the Offering Documents or in any other document.  In particular, we note that the Company may engage in
Officers' Certificate
Company
transactions in which we have not provided legal advice, and have not reviewed, and of which we may be unaware.  We have, consequently, assumed and relied on HCP's representation that the statements, representations and covenants contained in the Officers' Certificate, the Offering Documents and other documents, or otherwise furnished to us, accurately and completely describe all material facts relevant to our opinion.  We have assumed that such facts, statements, representations and covenants are true without regard to any qualification as to knowledge, belief, intent or materiality.  Our opinion is conditioned on the continuing accuracy and completeness of such facts, statements, representations and covenants.  We are not aware of any facts inconsistent with such statements, representations and covenants. We have, at the Company's request, also assumed for purposes of our opinion that any legal opinion received by the Company on or before November 8, 2010, to the effect that the Company was taxable as a real estate investment trust (a "") under Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), is correct.  Any material change or inaccuracy in the facts referred to, set forth or assumed herein or in the Officers' Certificate, including the correctness of any such prior legal opinion, may affect our conclusions set forth herein.
 
REIT
Code
 
In our review of certain documents in connection with our opinion as expressed below, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic or electronic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.  Where documents have been provided to us in draft form, we have assumed that the final executed versions of such documents will not differ materially from such drafts.
 
Our opinion is also based on the correctness of the following assumptions: (i) HCP and each of the entities comprising the Company has been and will continue to be operated in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was formed and in the manner described in the relevant organizational documents, (ii) there will be no changes in the applicable laws of the State of Maryland or of any other jurisdiction under the laws of which any of the entities comprising the Company have been formed and (iii) each of the written agreements to which the Company is a party has been and will be implemented, construed and enforced in accordance with its terms.
 
In rendering our opinion, we have considered and relied upon the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder (""), administrative rulings and other Treasury interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the Internal Revenue Service (""), all as they exist at the date hereof.  It should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect.  A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our conclusions set forth herein.  In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel's best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position if asserted by the IRS.
Regulations

We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States.  We express no opinion on any issue relating to HCP or any investment therein, other than as expressly stated herein.
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.  Commencing with HCP's taxable year that ended on December 31, 1985, HCP has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation through the date of this letter has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will continue to enable, it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code thereafter.
 
2.  Although the discussions set forth in the Registration Statement under the heading "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" and in each of the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Supplemental Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" do not purport to discuss all possible United States Federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Shares, such discussions, though general in nature, constitute, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary under current law of the material United States Federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Shares, subject to the qualifications set forth therein.  The United States Federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of such Shares by a holder will depend upon that holder's particular situation, and we express no opinion as to the completeness of the discussions set forth in the Registration Statement under the heading "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Supplemental Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" as applied to any particular holder.
 
As noted in the Offering Documents, HCP's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual operating results, certain requirements relating to the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and various other qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of HCP's operation for any one taxable year will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
 
This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the Offering.  This opinion may not be relied upon by anyone else without our prior written consent.  This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.

RE:
                             
Certain United States Federal Income Tax Matters
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
You have requested our opinion concerning certain United States Federal income tax considerations in connection with the offering (the "") of up to 22,000,000 shares of common stock (the "") by HCP, Inc., a Maryland corporation (""), pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-182824), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "") on July 24, 2012 (together with the prospectus filed therewith, the ""), a preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the Commission on October 16, 2012 (the "") and a prospectus supplement filed with the Commission on October 18, 2012 (the "", and collectively with the Registration Statement and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the ""). We have acted as tax counsel to HCP in connection with, and have participated in the preparation of, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement.

Offering Documents
 
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Offering Documents and such other documentation and information provided to us by you as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. In addition, you have provided us with, and we are relying upon, a certificate containing certain factual statements, factual representations and covenants of officers of HCP (the "") relating to, among other things, the actual and proposed operations of HCP
Officers' Certificate
and the entities in which it holds, or has held, a direct or indirect interest (collectively, the ""). These representations and covenants relate, in some cases, to transactions and investments for which we did not act as the Company's primary counsel. For purposes of our opinion, we have not independently verified all of the facts, statements, representations and covenants set forth in the Officers' Certificate, the Offering Documents or in any other document. In particular, we note that the Company may engage in transactions in which we have not provided legal advice, and have not reviewed, and of which we may be unaware. We have, consequently, assumed and relied on your representation that the statements, representations and covenants contained in the Officers' Certificate, the Offering Documents, and other documents, or otherwise furnished to us, accurately and completely describe all material facts relevant to our opinion. We have assumed that such facts, statements, representations and covenants are true without regard to any qualification as to knowledge, belief, intent or materiality.
Company
 
Our opinion is conditioned on the continuing accuracy and completeness of such facts, statements, representations and covenants. We are not aware of any facts inconsistent with such statements, representations and covenants. We have, at the Company's request, also assumed for purposes of our opinion that any legal opinion received by the Company on or before November 8, 2010, to the effect that the Company was taxable as a real estate investment trust (a "") under Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), is correct. Any material change or inaccuracy in the facts referred to, set forth or assumed herein or in the Officers' Certificate, including the correctness of any such prior legal opinion, may affect our conclusions set forth herein.
REIT
Code
 
In our review of certain documents in connection with our opinion as expressed below, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic or electronic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. Where documents have been provided to us in draft form, we have assumed that the final executed versions of such documents will not differ materially from such drafts.
 
Our opinion is also based on the correctness of the following assumptions: (i) HCP and each of the entities comprising the Company has been and will continue to be operated in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was formed and in the manner described in the relevant organizational documents, (ii) there will be no changes in the applicable laws of the State of Maryland or of any other jurisdiction under the laws of which any of the entities comprising the Company have been formed and (iii) each of the written agreements to which the Company is a party has been and will be implemented, construed and enforced in accordance with its terms.
 
In rendering our opinion, we have considered and relied upon the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder (""), administrative rulings and other Treasury interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the Internal
Regulations
Revenue Service (""), all as they exist at the date hereof. It should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect. A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our conclusions set forth herein. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel's best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position if asserted by the IRS.

We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States. We express no opinion on any issue relating to HCP or any investment therein, other than as expressly stated herein.
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, commencing with HCP's taxable year that ended on December 31, 1985, HCP has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation through the date of this letter has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will continue to enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code thereafter.
 
As noted in the Offering Documents, HCP's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual operating results, certain requirements relating to the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and various other qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of HCP's operation for any one taxable year will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
 
This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the Offering.  We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form 8-K, filed with the Commission on October 19, 2012 and to the reference to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP under the caption "Supplemental Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.
