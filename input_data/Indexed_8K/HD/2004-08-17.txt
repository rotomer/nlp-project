Excluding the impact of the adoption of EITF 02-16, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.71, or 27 percent higher than last year. Sales for the period increased $2.0 billion, or 11 percent, to $20.0 billion. Comparable store sales rose 4.8 percent, with strength across all geographic regions. "Our business strategy of enhancing the core, extending the business and expanding our markets is clearly driving consistent, profitable sales growth. For the first time in our company's 25-year history, we achieved $20 billion in sales in a single quarter. This achievement demonstrates that our knowledgeable associates are delivering on our company's core purpose: to improve everything we touch," said Bob Nardelli, chairman, president & CEO. The company ended the quarter with $38.3 billion in total assets, including $3.7 billion in cash and stockholders' equity of $22.5 billion. The company announced that it completed its $6 billion share repurchase program in the second quarter. Earlier this month, the company's board of directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program, bringing the total to $7 billion. "Our company remains committed to creating and returning value to our shareholders, as evidenced by our financial results and our dividend and share repurchase programs," added Nardelli. "In the first six months of the year, we have returned $2.8 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases." Return on invested capital was 20.4 percent, up 260 basis points from the second quarter last year. "In addition to our record sales during the second quarter, the company had record operating margin of 12.3 percent, one of the highest in retail, reflecting strong gross margin expansion and good expense control," said Carol Tome, executive vice president, CFO. In the first half of the year, 52% of the company's stores, along with four store support centers, achieved a payout through The Home Depot's Success Sharing bonus plan. With this program, The Home Depot will be paying out $30 million in September, almost twice as much as was paid out last year. -more-

-3- The adjusted earnings per share included in this press release is reconciled to the comparable generally accepted accounting principles amount in the attached schedule. In January 2004, the company adopted EITF 02-16 "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor." Management believes that excluding the impact of EITF 02-16 allows investors to compare the results of operations without giving effect to this new accounting standard. Founded in 1978, The Home Depot(R) is the world's largest home improvement specialty retailer and the second largest retailer in the United States, with fiscal 2003 sales of $64.8 billion. During the quarter, The Home Depot added 48 new stores. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the company operated a total of 1,788 stores, including 1,569 The Home Depot stores in the United States, 105 The Home Depot stores in Canada, and 42 The Home Depot stores in Mexico. The company also operates 54 EXPO Design Centers, 11 The Home Depot Landscape Supply stores, five The Home Depot Supply stores, and two The Home Depot Floor Stores. The company employs approximately 300,000 associates and today has stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, eight Canadian provinces and Mexico. Its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:HD) and is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Statements of The Home Depot's expectations for sales growth, earnings performance, capital expenditures, store openings and demand for services in this release constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based on currently available operating, financial and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's historical experience and its present expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in and the overall condition of the U.S. economy, stability of costs and availability of sourcing channels, conditions affecting new store development, the company's ability to integrate the businesses it acquires, the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from acquisitions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, the company's ability to implement new technologies and processes, the company's ability to attract, train and retain highly-qualified associates, unanticipated weather conditions, and the impact of competition and regulatory and litigation matters. Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements, as such statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Additional information regarding these and other risks is contained in the company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ### For more information, contact: - ------------------------------ Financial Community News Media Diane Dayhoff Jerry Shields Vice President, Investor Relations Senior Public Relations Manager (770) 384-2666 (770) 384-2741 diane_dayhoff@homedepot.com jerry_shields@homedepot.com
