Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
        On September 16, 2004, The Home Depot, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into an Indenture (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, relating to the Company's issuance of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% Senior Notes due 2009 (the "Senior Notes"). A copy of such agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference. A form of the Senior Note is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2 and incorporated herein by reference. For a description of the material terms of the Indenture and the Senior Notes issued thereunder, see the information set forth below under Item 2.03, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
        On September 16, 2004, the Company sold through a private placement (the "Private Placement") exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), $1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes pursuant to the Indenture. The Senior Notes were sold within the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and outside the United States only to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
        The Company issued the Senior Notes at a purchase price of 99.496% per Senior Note, bearing an interest rate of 3.75% and maturing on September 15, 2009 to certain initial purchasers of such Senior Notes. Interest on the Senior Notes will be payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2005, to the person in whose name such Senior Notes is registered at the close of business on the March 1 or September 1, respectively, preceding such interest payment date. Interest on the Senior Notes will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Pursuant to the Indenture, the Company is generally not limited in its ability to incur additional indebtedness nor required to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. However, the Indenture contains customary covenants that will limit the Company's ability and, in certain instances, the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to incur liens on assets to secure debt, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and merge or consolidate with another company or sell substantially all of its assets.
        The Company, at its option, may at any time and from time to time redeem all or any portion of the Senior Notes on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice mailed to the holders of the Senior Notes to be redeemed. The Senior Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption, equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption (except that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months). The discount rate for the Senior Notes will be the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Indenture) plus 10 basis points.
        The Indenture provides that each of the following is an event of default: (1) a default for 30 days in payment of any interest due with respect to the Senior Notes; (2) default in payment of principal or premium, if any, on the Senior Notes; (3) default for 90 days after written notice to the Company by the trustee or by holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding in the performance of any covenant or other agreement in the Indenture or the Senior Notes for the benefit of the Senior Notes; (4) indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any subsidiary is accelerated because of a default and the total amount of such indebtedness is not
discharged or such acceleration is not cured, waived, annulled or rescinded within ten days after notice to the Company by the trustee or by holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding; and (5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes within ten days after notice to the Company may declare all the Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately, together with interest, if any, accrued thereon.
        Under the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of September 13, 2004, among the Company, Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets LLC, the Company agreed to register notes having substantially identical terms as the Senior Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as part of an offer to exchange freely tradeable exchange notes (the "Exchange Notes") for the Senior Notes. The Company has agreed to file a registration statement for the Exchange Notes with the Commission within 90 days from September 16, 2004 and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days from September 16, 2004. Under certain circumstances, the Company will be obligated to file a shelf registration statement with respect to the Senior Notes. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, if the Company fails to satisfy certain filing and other obligations with respect to the exchange, the Company will be obligated to pay an additional annual interest rate on the Senior Notes of 0.25% per annum. Such additional interest would cease to accrue once such default is remedied.
        The description set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the Indenture, the form of Senior Note and the Registration Rights Agreement filed herewith as exhibits.
        A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3 and incorporated herein by reference. A press release issued by the Company on September 13, 2004 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

        This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of the Company, limited to the aggregate Principal Amount of $1,000,000,000 (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture mentioned below), issued or to be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of September 16, 2004 (the "

Additional Interest

To be included in Exchange Securities.
        In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all the Securities may be declared due and payable, in the manner and with the effect, and subject to the conditions, provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that in certain events such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities then outstanding and that, prior to any such declaration, such holders may waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences except a default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Security and any Security which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Security or such other Securities.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Securities, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities, to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to holders of Securities in the case of a transaction described in Section 9.01, to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Securities or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder, or to comply with requirements of the Commission (as defined in the Indenture) in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act (as defined in the Indenture).
        No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the place, times, and rate, and in the currency, herein prescribed.

        At the office or agency of the Company referred to on the face hereof and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, Securities may be exchanged for a like aggregate Principal Amount of Securities of other authorized denominations.
        Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the above-mentioned office or agency of the Company, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations, for a like aggregate Principal Amount, will be issued to the transferee as provided in the Indenture. No service charge shall be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.
        The Securities are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time and from time to time, on not less than 30 or more than 60 days' prior notice mailed to the Holders of the Securities, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the Principal Amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments thereon discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 10 basis points, together in either case with accrued interest on the Principal Amount being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
        Subject to payment by the Company of a sum sufficient to pay the amount due on redemption, interest on this Security (or portion hereof if this Security is redeemed in part) shall cease to accrue upon the date duly fixed for redemption of this Security (or portion hereof if this Security is redeemed in part).
        The Company, the Trustee, and any authorized agent of the Company or the Trustee, may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Security (whether or not this Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone other than the Company, the Trustee or any authorized agent of the Company or the Trustee), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and premium, if any, and, subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon and for all other purposes, and none of the Company, the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
        No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or the interest on this Security, for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
        The Indenture is hereby incorporated by the reference and to the extent of any variance between the provisions hereof and the Indenture, the Indenture shall control. Terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture.
        This Security shall be deemed to be a contract under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of said State, except as may otherwise be required by mandatory provisions of law.
Dated:

Security Register(s)
") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will register, and will register the transfer of, Securities as in this Article provided. Such Security Register or Security Registers shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted into such form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times such Security Register or Security Registers shall be open for inspection by the Trustee.
        Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security at each such office or agency, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities, in each case, in authorized denominations for a like aggregate Principal Amount.
        A Holder may transfer a Security only by written application to the Registrar stating the name of the proposed transferee and otherwise complying with the terms of this Indenture. No such transfer shall be effected until, and such transferee shall succeed to the rights of a Holder only upon, final acceptance and registration of the transfer by the Registrar in the Security Register. Prior to the registration of any transfer by a Holder as provided herein, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company shall treat the person in whose name the Security is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes whether or not the Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Furthermore, any Holder of a Global Security shall, by acceptance of such Global Security, agree that transfers of beneficial interests in such Global Security may be effected only through a book entry system maintained by the Holder of such Global Security (or its agent) and that ownership of a beneficial interest in the Security shall be required to be reflected in a book entry. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a
co-Registrar with a request to register the transfer or to exchange them for an equal Principal Amount of Securities of other authorized denominations (including an exchange of Initial Securities for Exchange Securities), the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if the requirements for such transactions set forth herein are met;
provided
that no exchanges of Initial Securities for Exchange Securities shall occur until a Registration Statement shall have been declared effective by the Commission and that any Initial Securities that are exchanged for Exchange Securities shall be cancelled by the Trustee. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request.
        The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities (other than any such transfer taxes or other similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Section 2.11, 8.05 or 10.03). No service charge to any Holder shall be made for any such transaction.
        The Company shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed, or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption except, in the case of any Security where public notice has been given that such Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
        All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
        SECTION 2.07
    Book-Entry Provisions for Global Securities.
    (a) Each Global Security initially shall (i) be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (ii) be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for such Depositary and (iii) bear legends as set forth in Section 2.05.
        Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("
Agent Members
") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee as its custodian, or under the Global Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.
        (b)   Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees. If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be qualified to serve as the Depositary, the Company shall appoint a successor depositary with respect to the Securities. If a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities, will authenticate and deliver Securities of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Global Securities or Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
        The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Securities. In such event, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the
authentication and delivery of definitive Securities, will authenticate and deliver Securities of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Global Security or Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary and the provisions of Section 2.08. In addition, Physical Securities shall be transferred to all beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Security, if (i) the Depositary (A) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, (B) ceases to be qualified to serve as Depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so transferable, registrable and exchangeable, and such transfers shall be registrable, or (iii) an Event of Default of which the Trustee has actual notice has occurred and is continuing and the Registrar has received a request from the Depositary to issue such Physical Securities.
        (c)   Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Securities that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Security will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Security and become an interest in the other Global Security and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Security for as long as it remains such an interest.
        (d)   In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.07, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the Principal Amount of such Global Security in an amount equal to the Principal Amount of the beneficial interest in such Global Security to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, one or more Physical Securities of like tenor and amount.
        (e)   In connection with the transfer of an entire Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, such Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interest in such Global Security, an equal Principal Amount of Physical Securities of authorized denominations.
        (f)    Any Physical Security delivered in exchange for an interest in a Global Security pursuant to paragraph (b) or (d) of this Section shall, except as otherwise provided by Section 2.04, bear the legend regarding transfer restrictions applicable to the Physical Security set forth in Section 2.05.
        (g)   The registered holder of a Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any person, including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.
        SECTION 2.08
    Special Transfer Provisions.
    Unless and until an Initial Security is exchanged for an Exchange Security in connection with an effective Registration pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the following provisions shall apply:
        (a)   The transfer or exchange of any Security (or a beneficial interest therein) that bears the Restricted Legend may only be made in compliance with the provisions of the Restricted Legend.
        (b)   The Trustee will retain copies of all certificates, opinions and other documents received in connection with the transfer or exchange of a Security (or a beneficial interest therein), and the Company will have the right to inspect and make copies thereof at any reasonable time upon written notice to the Trustee.
        (c)   By its acceptance of any Security bearing the Private Placement Legend, each Holder of such a Security acknowledges the restrictions on transfer of such Security set forth in this Indenture and in the Private Placement Legend and agrees that it will transfer such Security only as provided in this Indenture. The Registrar shall not register a transfer of any Security unless such transfer complies with the restrictions on transfer of such Security set forth in this Indenture. In connection with any transfer of Securities, each Holder agrees by its acceptance of the Securities to furnish the Registrar or the Company such certifications, legal opinions or other information as either of them may reasonably require to confirm that such transfer is being made pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act;
provided
that the Registrar shall not be required to determine (but may rely on a determination made by the Company with respect to) the sufficiency of any such certifications, legal opinions or other information.
        The Registrar shall retain copies of all letters, notices and other written communications received pursuant to Section 2.07(a) or this Section 2.08. The Company shall have the right to inspect and make copies of all such letters, notices or other written communications at any reasonable time upon the giving of reasonable written notice to the Registrar.
        Each Holder of a Security agrees to indemnify the Company and the Trustee against any liability that may result from the transfer, exchange or assignment of such Holder's Security in violation of any provision of this Indenture and/or applicable United States Federal or state securities law.
        The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
        SECTION 2.09
    Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
    In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in its discretion may execute, and upon the written request of any officer of the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, a new Security bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and substitution for the Security so apparently destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by each of them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
        Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature, or has been called for redemption in full, shall become mutilated or defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless from all risks, however remote, and, in every case of apparent destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
        Every substitute Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any Security is apparently destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, or apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
        SECTION 2.10
    Cancellation of Securities.
    All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, if surrendered to the Company or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
        SECTION 2.11
    Temporary Securities.
    Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery temporary Securities (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities shall be issuable as registered Securities without coupons, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Company shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities and thereupon temporary Securities may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Company for the purpose pursuant to Section 3.02, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange for such temporary Securities a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities.
        SECTION 2.12
    CUSIP and CINS Numbers.
    The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" and "CINS" numbers (if then generally in use), and the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers or CINS numbers, as the case may be, in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption or exchange and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers or CINS numbers.
        SECTION 3.01
    Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest on Securities.
    The Company, for the benefit of the Securities, will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture.
        SECTION 3.02
    Maintenance of Office or Agency.
    The Company will maintain a Payment Office where Securities may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices, and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby initially appoints the Trustee at its office or agency as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
        SECTION 3.03
    Money for Securities Payments to be Held in Trust.
    
        (a)   If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to the Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on the Securities, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
        (b)   Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for the Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on the Securities, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
        (c)   The Company will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent will agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 3.03, that such Paying Agent will (i) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent (ii) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities in trust for the benefit of the Holders until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided; (iii) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities; and (iv) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities, and upon the written request of that Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities.
        (d)   The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent will be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
        (e)   Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, or interest has become due and payable will be paid to the Company upon a Company Request (or, if then held by the Company, will be discharged from such trust); and the Holder of such Security will thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, will thereupon cease;
provided, however
, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such
repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which will not be less than 30 calendar days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
        SECTION 3.04
    Existence.
    Subject to Article 9, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights (charter and statutory), and franchises;
provided, however
, that the Company will not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors determines that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof will not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
        SECTION 3.05
    Statement by Officers as to Default.
    The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 calendar days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate signed by the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or treasurer of the Company stating whether or not to the knowledge of such person after due inquiry the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions, and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Company is in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which such person may have such knowledge. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, as soon as possible and in any event within five days after the Company becomes aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default or an event which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default, an Officers' Certificate setting forth the details of such Event of Default or default and the action which the Company proposes to take with respect thereto.
        SECTION 3.06
    Waiver of Certain Covenants.
    The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision, or condition set forth in Section 3.07, Section 3.08 and the provisions of any supplemental indenture specified in such supplemental indenture, with respect to the Securities if the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision, or condition, but no such waiver will extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision, or condition will remain in full force and effect.
        SECTION 3.07
    Limitations on Liens.
    (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, issue, assume or guarantee any notes, bonds, debentures or other similar evidences of indebtedness for money borrowed (herein referred to as "indebtedness") secured by any mortgage, security interest, pledge or lien (herein referred to as "mortgage") of or upon any Principal Property, or of or upon shares of capital stock or evidences of indebtedness of any Subsidiary that owns any Principal Property, whether such Principal Property, shares of capital stock or evidences of indebtedness are owned at the date of this Indenture or thereafter acquired, without making effective provision, and the Company in each case will make or cause to be made effective provision, whereby the Principal Amount of all of the Securities from time to time outstanding shall be secured equally and ratably with (or at the option of the Company, prior to) such mortgage;
provided, however
, that this Section 3.07 shall not apply to indebtedness secured by any of the following:
          (i)  mortgages existing on the date hereof;
         (ii)  mortgages on any property existing at the time of acquisition thereof;
        (iii)  mortgages on property, shares of capital stock or evidences of indebtedness of a corporation existing at the time such corporation is merged into or consolidated with, or disposes of substantially all of its properties (or those of a division) to, the Company or a Subsidiary;
        (iv)  mortgages on property of a corporation, shares of capital stock or evidences of indebtedness of any corporation existing at the time such corporation becomes a Subsidiary;
         (v)  mortgages securing indebtedness of a Subsidiary to the Company or to another Subsidiary;
        (vi)  mortgages on property to secure the cost of acquisition, construction, development or substantial repair, alteration or improvement of such property, provided the commitment of the creditor to extend the credit secured by any such mortgage shall have been obtained not later than sixty months after the later of (A) the completion of the acquisition, construction, development, substantial repair, alteration or improvement of such property or (B) the placing in operation of such property as so acquired, constructed, developed or substantially repaired, altered or improved;
       (vii)  mortgages securing current liabilities payable on demand or not more than one year after the date as of which the determination is made (excluding any indebtedness renewable or extendable at the option of the debtor for a period or periods ending more than one year after the date as of which such determination is made), which indebtedness in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices would be included among current liabilities;
      (viii)  any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals or replacements), in whole or in part, of any mortgage referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) to (vii) inclusive; provided, however, that the principal amount of indebtedness secured thereby and not otherwise authorized by said clauses (i) to (vii) inclusive shall not exceed the principal amount of indebtedness, plus any premium or fee payable in connection with any such extension, renewal or replacement, so secured at the time of such extension, renewal or replacement;
        (ix)  mortgages in favor of the United States of America or any State thereof, or any department, agency or instrumentality or political subdivision of the United States of America or any State thereof, to secure partial progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any contract or statute or to secure any indebtedness incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of constructing or improving the property subject to such mortgages;
         (x)  mortgages arising out of any final judgment for the payment of money aggregating not in excess of $100,000,000 or mortgages created by or relating to any legal proceeding or final judgment which at the time is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, provided enforcement of any mortgage has been stayed; or
        (xi)  mortgages for taxes or other governmental charges either not yet delinquent or the nonpayment of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; mortgages comprising landlord's liens or liens of carriers, warehousemen, mechanics or materialmen incurred in the ordinary course of business for sums not yet due and payable or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; and any other mortgages incurred or created in the ordinary course of business not arising in connection with indebtedness that do not in the aggregate materially impair the use or value of the properties or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
        (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.07(a), the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may, however, issue, assume or guarantee indebtedness secured by mortgages which would otherwise be subject to the restrictions of Section 3.07(a) in an aggregate amount which, together with all Attributable Debt outstanding pursuant to Section 3.08(b) and all indebtedness outstanding pursuant to
this Section 3.07(b), does not at the time exceed the greater of 15% of all Consolidated Net Tangible Assets or 15% of Consolidated Capitalization.
        SECTION 3.08
    Limitations on Sale and Leaseback Transactions.
    (a) The Company will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Lease-Back Transaction with respect to any Principal Property (except for transactions providing for a lease for a term, including any renewal thereof, of not more than 48 months and except for a transaction between the Company and a Subsidiary or between Subsidiaries), unless either (x) the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled pursuant to Section 3.07(a) to issue, assume or guarantee evidences of indebtedness secured by a mortgage on such Principal Property in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction without being required by Section 3.07(a) to equally and ratably secure the Principal Amount of the Securities from time to time outstanding or (y) the Company shall apply or cause to be applied, in the case of a sale or transfer for cash, an amount equal to the net proceeds thereof (but not in excess of the net book value of such Principal Property at the date of such sale or transfer) and, in the case of a sale or transfer otherwise than for cash, an amount equal to the fair value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of the Principal Property so leased (x) to the retirement, within one year after the effective date of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, of Securities or other Senior Funded Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary or (y) to the purchase of a Principal Property or Principal Properties (other than the Principal Property involved in such sale or transfer); provided, however, that any such retirement of Securities shall be in accordance with Article 10 and any other terms and provisions of this Indenture and the Securities applicable to optional redemption of Securities and, provided further, that the amount to be applied to such retirement of Securities or other Senior Funded Indebtedness shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the applicable Redemption Price with respect to Securities delivered within one year after the effective date of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation and (B) the principal amount, plus any premium or fee paid in connection with any redemption in accordance with the terms, of other Senior Funded Indebtedness voluntarily retired by the Company within such one year period, excluding in each case retirements pursuant to mandatory sinking fund or prepayment provisions and payments at maturity.

        (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.08(a), the Company or any Subsidiary may enter into a Sale and Lease-Back Transaction which would otherwise be subject to the restrictions of Section 3.08(a) so as to create an aggregate amount of Attributable Debt which, together with all indebtedness outstanding pursuant to Section 3.07(b) and all Attributable Debt outstanding pursuant to this Section 3.08(b), does not exceed 15% of Consolidated Capitalization.
        SECTION 3.09
    Reports by the Company.
    The Company will file with the Trustee and the Commission and transmit to Holders, such information, documents and other reports as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act. Delivery of such information, documents and reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates). At any time when the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, upon request of Holders and prospective purchasers of Securities thereof, the Company will promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to such holders and prospective purchasers, copies of the information required to be delivered to such holders and prospective purchasers of such securities pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto) in order to permit compliance with Rule 144A in connection with
resales by such holders of such securities. The Company will pay the expenses of printing and distributing to such holders and prospective purchasers all such documents.
        SECTION 4.01
    Events of Default.
    Each of the following constitutes an "EVENT OF DEFAULT":

        (d)   default with respect to any indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any Subsidiary which default results in the acceleration of such indebtedness and the total amount of such indebtedness accelerated exceeds $100,000,000, and such indebtedness is not discharged or such acceleration is not cured, waived, rescinded or annulled within a period of 10 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities, a notice specifying such default and requiring such indebtedness to be discharged or such acceleration to be cured, waived, rescinded or annulled;
        (e)   the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Company bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator, or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive calendar days; or
        (f)    the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief with respect to the Company under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator, or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property pursuant to any such law, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action.
        Upon receipt by the Trustee of any Notice of Default pursuant to this Section 4.01, a record date shall automatically and without any other action by any Person be set for the purpose of determining the Holders of outstanding Securities entitled to join in such Notice of Default, which record date shall be the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such Notice of Default. The Holders of outstanding Securities on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only such Persons,
shall be entitled to join in such Notice of Default, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date.
        SECTION 4.02
    Acceleration.
    (a) If any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (e) or (f) of Section 4.01 hereof) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Except as set forth above, upon such declaration the principal of, premium, if any, and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (e) or (f) of Section 4.01 hereof occurs with respect to the Company the unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without further action or notice on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
        (b)   At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Securities has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article 4 provided, the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (i) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue interest on all of the Securities, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) Securities which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements, and advances of the Trustee and its agents and counsel and (ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Securities, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Securities which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 4.04. No such rescission will affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
        SECTION 4.03
    Other Remedies.
    If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.
        The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
        SECTION 4.04
    Waiver of Past Defaults.
    The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under this Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to waive any past default hereunder. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to waive any default hereunder, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date.
        Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
        SECTION 4.05
    Control by Majority.
    Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture that the Trustee in good faith determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders or that may involve or cause the Trustee any potential liability. The Trustee may take any other action which it deems proper which is not inconsistent with any such direction.
        Upon receipt by the Trustee of any such direction with respect to the Securities, a record date shall automatically and without any other action by any Person be set for determining the Holders of outstanding Securities entitled to join in such direction, which record date shall be the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such direction. The Holders of outstanding Securities on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date.
        SECTION 4.06
    Limitation on Suits.
    A Holder may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities only if:
        (a)   the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;
        (b)   the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
        (c)   such Holder or Holders offer to provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
        (d)   the Trustee does not comply with the request within 90 days after receipt of the notice, request and the offer of indemnity; and
        (e)   during such 90-day period the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder.
        SECTION 4.07
    Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.
        SECTION 4.08
    Collection Suit by Trustee.
    If an Event of Default specified in Section 4.01(a) or (b) hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or any other obligor for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on the Securities and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover amounts due the Trustee under Section 5.07 hereof, including the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
        SECTION 4.09
    Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
    The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 5.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 5.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
        SECTION 4.10
    Priorities.
    If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
        First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 5.07, including payment of all compensation, expense and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection;
        Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal, premium, if any and interest, respectively; and
        Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.
        The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 4.10 upon five Business Days prior notice to the Company.
        SECTION 4.11
    Undertaking for Costs.
    In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 4.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities.
        SECTION 5.01
    Duties and Responsibilities of the Trustee; During Default; Prior to Default.
    The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default has occurred (and is continuing which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
        No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own wilful misconduct, except that
        (a)   prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default which may have occurred:
          (i)  the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
         (ii)  in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;
        (b)   the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
        (c)   the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the holders of not less than a majority in Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.
        None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any potential or actual liability (financial or otherwise) in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such liability is not reasonably assured to it.
        This Section 5.01 is in furtherance of and subject to Sections 315 and 316 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
        Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
        SECTION 5.02
    Certain Rights of the Trustee.
    In furtherance of and subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and subject to Section 5.01:
        (a)   the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, Officers' Certificate or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, coupon, security or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
        (b)   any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed); and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be evidenced to the Trustee by a copy thereof certified by the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Company;
        (c)   the Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and any advice or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;
        (d)   the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered and provided to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred therein or thereby; but nothing herein contained shall, however, relieve the Trustee of the obligation, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (which has not been cured or waived), to exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs;
        (e)   the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion, rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture;
        (f)    the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, coupon, security, or other paper or document unless requested in writing so to do by the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities then outstanding; provided that, if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it against such expenses or liabilities as a condition to proceeding; the reasonable expenses of every such examination shall be paid by the Company;
        (g)   the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys not regularly in its employ and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;
        (h)   the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee under this Indenture, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and to each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder;
        (i)    the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture; and
        (j)    The Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superceded.
        SECTION 5.03
    Trustee Not Responsible for Recitals, Disposition of Securities or Application of Proceeds Thereof.
    The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or
sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. The Trustee shall not be liable or accountable in any manner for the use or application by the Company of any of the Securities or of the proceeds thereof.
        SECTION 5.04
    Trustee and Agents May Hold Securities; Collections, etc.
    The Trustee or any of its affiliates or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities, subject to Sections 5.10 and 5.13 with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent and may otherwise deal with the Company and receive, collect, hold and retain collections from the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent.
        SECTION 5.05
    Moneys Held by Trustee.
    Subject to the provisions of Section 11.06 hereof, all moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by mandatory provisions of law. Neither the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be under any liability for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder, except as otherwise agreed with the Company.
        SECTION 5.06
    Notice of Default.
    If any Default or any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if such Default or Event of Default is actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder in the manner and to the extent provided in Trust Indenture Act Section 313(c) notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs, unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders.
        SECTION 5.07
    Compensation and Indemnification of Trustee and Its Prior Claim.
    The Company covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Trustee (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and the Company covenants and agrees to pay or reimburse the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by or on behalf of it in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of all agents and other persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its negligence or bad faith. The Company also covenants to indemnify the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based on the income of the Trustee) incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Indenture or the trusts hereunder and its duties hereunder, including without limitation the costs and expenses of defending itself against or investigating any claim (whether asserted by the Company, a Holder or any other Person) of liability in the premises. The obligations of the Company under this Section to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder and shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. Such additional indebtedness shall be a senior claim to that of the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the holders of particular Securities, and the Securities are hereby subordinated to such senior claim.
        When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 4.01(e) or Section 4.01(f), the expenses (including the reasonable charges and
expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.
        SECTION 5.08
    Right of Trustee to Rely on Officers' Certificate, etc.
    Subject to Sections 5.01 and 5.02, whenever in the administration of the trusts of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and such certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.
        SECTION 5.09
    Persons Eligible for Appointment as Trustee.
    The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be a corporation having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, and which is eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of a Federal, State or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.
        SECTION 5.10
    Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor Trustee.
    (a) The Trustee may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Company and to the Holders, such notice to the Holders to be given by mailing (by first class mail) the same within 30 days after such notice is given to the Company. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 60 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning trustee may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
        (b)   In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
          (i)  the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, after written request therefor by the Company or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months; or
         (ii)  the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Securityholder; or
        (iii)  the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged as bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors of the Company, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months may on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee
and the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
        (c)   The holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by delivering to the Trustee so removed, to the successor trustee so appointed and to the Company the evidence provided for in Section 6.01 of the action in that regard taken by the Securityholders.
        If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment 60 days after the mailing of such notice of removal, the trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
        (d)   Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and any appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 5.10 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 5.11.
        SECTION 5.11
    Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee.
    Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 5.10 shall execute and deliver to the Company and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Company or of the successor trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 11.06, pay over to the successor trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.07.
        Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section 5.11, the Company shall mail notice thereof by first-class mail to the holders of Securities at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Security register. If the acceptance of appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section 5.10. If the Company fails to mail such notice within 10 days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Company.
        SECTION 5.12
    Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee.
    Any corporation or national association into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or to which the Trustee's assets may be sold, or any corporation or national association resulting from any merger, conversion, consolidation or sale to which the Trustee shall be a party or by which the Trustee's property may be bound, or any corporation or national association succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such entity shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 5.09, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
        In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and deliver such
Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force that it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; provided, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
        SECTION 5.13
    Preferential Collection of Claims.
    If the Trustee shall be or shall become a creditor, directly or indirectly, secured or unsecured, of the Company (or any other obligor on the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of Section 311 of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). For purposes of Section 311(b) (4) and (6) of such Act, the following terms shall mean:
        (a)   "
cash transaction
" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand; and
        (b)   "
self-liquidating paper
" means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Company for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the Company arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation.
        SECTION 6.01
    Evidence of Action Taken by Holders.
    Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Securityholders may be embodied in and evidenced (a) by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing, (b) by the record of the holders of Securities voting in favor thereof at any meeting of Securityholders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article 7, or (c) by a combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting of Securityholders; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 5.01 and 5.02) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
        SECTION 6.02
    Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of Securities; Record Date.
    Subject to Sections 5.01 and 5.02, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy may be proved in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee. The holding of Securities shall be proved by the Security register or by a certificate of the Registrar thereof. The Company may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of holders of Securities entitled to vote or consent to any action referred to in Section 6.01, which record date may be set at any time or from time to time by notice to the Trustee, for any date or dates (in the case of any adjournment or resolicitation) not more than 90 days nor less than 20 days prior to the proposed date of such vote or consent, and thereafter, notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, only holders of Securities of record on such record date shall be entitled to so vote or give such consent or to withdraw such vote or consent.
        SECTION 6.03
    Who May Be Deemed Owners of Securities.
    The Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security registrar may deem and treat the person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company on the applicable record date as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to, or upon the order of, any Holders shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability of moneys payable upon any such Security.
        SECTION 6.04
    Securities Owned by Company Deemed Not Outstanding.
    In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate Principal Amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Securities shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described persons; and, subject to Sections 5.01 and 5.02, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
        SECTION 6.05
    Record Date for Action by Securityholders.
    Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any direction, notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), other than any action taken at a meeting of Securityholders called pursuant to Article 7, the Company, pursuant to a resolution of its Board of Directors, or the Holders of at least ten percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, may request the Trustee to fix a record date for determining Securityholders entitled to notice of and to take any such action. In case the Company or the Holders of Securities in the amount above specified shall desire to request Securityholders to take any action and shall request the Trustee to fix a record date with respect thereto by written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the Securityholder action to be requested, the Trustee shall promptly (but in any event within five days of receipt of such request) fix a record date that shall be a business day not less than 15 nor more than 20 days after the date on which the Trustee receives such request. If the Trustee shall fail to fix a record date as hereinabove provided, then the Company or the Holders in the amount above specified may fix the same by mailing written notice thereof (the record date so fixed to be a business day not less than 15 nor more than 20 days after the date on which such written notice shall be given) to the Trustee. If a record date is fixed according to this Section 6.05, only persons shown as Securityholders on the registration books for the Company at the close of business on the record date so fixed shall be entitled to take the requested action and the taking of such action by the Holders on the record date of the required percentage of the aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities shall be binding on all
Securityholders, provided that the taking of the requested action by the Holders on the record date of the percentage in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities in connection with such action shall have been evidenced to the Trustee, as provided in Section 6.01, not later than 180 days after such record date.
        SECTION 6.06
    Right of Revocation of Action Taken.
    At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 6.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the percentage in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the holders of the percentage in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities.
        SECTION 7.01
    Purposes for Which Meeting May Be Called.
    A meeting of Holders of Securities may be called at any time and from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this Article 7 for any of the following purposes:

        (b)   to remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee pursuant to the provisions of Article 5;

        SECTION 7.02
    Manner of Calling Meetings; Record Date.
    The Trustee may at any time call a meeting of Securityholders to take any action specified in Section 7.01, to be held at such time and at such place in The City of New York, New York, or as the Trustee shall determine. Notice of every meeting of the Securityholders setting forth the time and the place of such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such meeting, shall be mailed not less than thirty nor more than sixty days prior to the date fixed for the meeting to such Securityholders at their registered addresses. For the purpose of determining Securityholders entitled to notice of any meeting of Securityholders, the Trustee shall fix in advance a date as the record date for such determination, such date to be a business day not more than ten days prior to the date of the mailing of such notice as hereinabove provided. Only persons in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company on a record date fixed by the Trustee as aforesaid, or by the Company or the Securityholders as in Section 7.03 provided, shall be entitled to notice of the meeting of Securityholders with respect to which such record date was so fixed.
        SECTION 7.03
    Call of Meeting by Company or Securityholders.
    In case at any time the Company, pursuant to a resolution of its Board of Directors, or the Holders of at least ten percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, shall have requested the Trustee to call a meeting of the Securityholders to take any action authorized in Section 7.01 by written request setting forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Trustee shall not have mailed notice of such meeting within twenty days after receipt of such request, then the Company or the Holders of such Securities in the amount above specified may fix the record date with respect to, and determine the time and the place for, such meeting and may call such meeting to take any action authorized in Section 7.01, by mailing notice thereof as provided in Section 7.02. The record date fixed as provided in the preceding sentence shall be set forth in a written notice to the Trustee and shall be a business day not less than 15 nor more than 20 days after the date on which such notice is sent to the Trustee.
        SECTION 7.04
    Who May Attend and Vote at Meeting.
    To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Securityholders a person shall be a holder of one or more Securities. The only person who shall be entitled to be present or to speak at any meeting of Securityholders shall be the persons entitled to vote at such meeting and their counsel and any representatives of the Trustee and its counsel and any representatives of the Company and its counsel. When a determination of Securityholders entitled to vote at any meeting of Securityholders has been made as provided in this Section 7.04, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.
        SECTION 7.05
    Regulations.
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee may make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of Securityholders, in regard to proof of the holding of the Securities and of the appointment of proxies, and in regard to the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall think fit. Except as otherwise permitted or required by any such regulations, the holding of such Securities shall be provided in the manner specified in Section 7.06.
        The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the Company or by Securityholders as provided in Section 7.03, in which case the Company or the Securityholders calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by a vote of the holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the Securities represented at the meeting and entitled to vote.
        Subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, at any meeting each Securityholder or proxy entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities held or represented by him; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Security challenged as not outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not outstanding. The chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote other than by virtue of Securities held by him or instruments in writing as aforesaid duly designating him as the person to vote on behalf of other Securityholders. Any meeting of Securityholders duly called pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.02 or 7.03 may be adjourned from time to time, and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.
        At any meeting of Securityholders, the presence of persons who held, or who are acting as proxy for persons who held, an aggregate Principal Amount of Securities on the record date for such meeting sufficient to take action on the business for the transaction of which such meeting was called shall constitute a quorum, but, if less than a quorum is present, the persons holding or representing a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities represented at the meeting may adjourn such meeting with the same effect, for all intents and purposes, as though a quorum had been present.
        SECTION 7.06
    Manner of Voting at Meetings and Record to be Kept.
    The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting of Securityholders shall be by written ballots on each of which shall be subscribed the signature of the Securityholder or proxy casting such ballot and the identifying number or numbers of the Securities held or represented in respect of which such ballot is cast. The permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any resolution and who shall make and file with the secretary of the meeting their verified written reports in duplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record in duplicate of the proceedings of each meeting of Securityholders shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having knowledge of the facts setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting and showing that said notice was mailed as provided in Section 7.02. The record shall show the identifying numbers of the Securities voting in favor of or against any resolution. Each counterpart of such record shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one of the counterparts shall be delivered to the Company and the other to the Trustee to be preserved by the Trustee.
        Any counterpart record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein stated and shall be the record referred to in clause (b) of Section 7.01.
        SECTION 7.07
    Exercise of Rights of Trustee and Securityholders Not to be Hindered or Delayed.
    Nothing in this Article 7 contained shall be deemed or construed to authorize or permit, by reason of any call of a meeting of Securityholders or any rights expressly or impliedly conferred hereunder to make such call, any hindrance or delay in the exercise of any right or rights conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Securityholders under any of the provisions of this Indenture or of the Securities.
        SECTION 8.01
    Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Holders.
    The Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities without the consent of any Holder:
        (a)   to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;
        (b)   to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities;
        (c)   to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to the Holders of the Securities in the case of any transaction pursuant to Article 9 hereof;
        (d)   to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor trustee and to add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee;
        (e)   to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Securities or that does not adversely affect the legal rights hereunder of any such Holder; or
        (f)    to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.
        Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of their respective Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 8.04 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of any supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture which affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
        SECTION 8.02
    With Consent of Holders.
    Except as provided in the next succeeding paragraphs, this Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for such Securities), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for such Securities).
        Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of their respective Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 8.04 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
        It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
        After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 4.04 and 4.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities then outstanding may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities. Without the consent of each Holder, however, an amendment or waiver may not:
        (a)   reduce the Principal Amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
        (b)   change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, or time for payment of interest on, any Security, or reduce the Principal Amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change any Payment Office where, or the coin or currency in which, any Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the stated maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date);
        (c)   modify any of the provisions of this Section 8.02, Section 4.04 or Section 3.06, except to increase the percentage in Principal Amount of Holders required under any such Section or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Security affected thereby, provided, however, that this clause (c) will not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section 8.02, Section 4.04 and Section 3.06, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Section 5.11; or
        (d)   make any change in this sentence of this Section 8.02.
        SECTION 8.03
    Effect of Supplemental Indenture.
    Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and
amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.
        SECTION 8.04
    Documents to Be Given to Trustee; Compliance with TIA.
    The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 5.01 and 5.02, may receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such supplemental indenture complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture. Every such supplemental indenture shall comply with the TIA.
        SECTION 8.05
    Notation on Securities in Respect of Supplemental Indentures.
    Securities authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article may bear a notation approved by the Trustee as to form (but not as to substance) as to any matter provided for by such supplemental indenture or as to any action taken at any such meeting. If the Company or the Trustee shall so determine, new Securities so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors of the Company, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Securities then outstanding.
        SECTION 9.01
    When the Company May Merge, Etc.
    The Company shall not consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless:
        (a)   the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America or any State or the District of Columbia, and shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on all the Securities and the performance or observance of every covenant of this Indenture of the part of the Company to be performed or observed;
        (b)   immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be continuing; and
        (c)   the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.
        SECTION 9.02
    Successor Corporation Substituted.
    Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 9.01 hereof, the successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Company is merged or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition, the provisions of this Indenture referring to the "
Company
" shall refer instead to the successor corporation), and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Company herein.
        In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Securities thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a consolidation or merger by the Company with or into, or (ii) the sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of its property or assets to, one or more of its Subsidiaries shall not relieve the Company from its obligations under this Indenture and the Securities.
        SECTION 9.03
    Opinion of Counsel to Trustee.
    The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 5.01 and 5.02, may receive an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer, lease, exchange or other disposition complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.
        SECTION 10.01
    Right of Optional Redemption; Prices.
    The Securities are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time and from time to time, on not less than 30 or more than 60 days' prior notice mailed to the Holders of the Securities, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the Principal Amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments thereon discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 10 basis points, together in either case with accrued interest on the Principal Amount being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
        SECTION 10.02
    Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions.
    Notice of redemption to the holders of Securities to be redeemed as a whole or in part shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such holders of Securities at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the registry books. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security.
        The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers) and shall specify the Principal Amount of each Security held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Security is to be redeemed in part only the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the Principal Amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities in Principal Amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
        The notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the option of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
        No later than 10:00 a.m. on the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. The Company will deliver to the Trustee at least 70 days prior to the date fixed for redemption an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate Principal Amount of Securities to be redeemed.
        If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, either pro rata, by lot or by any other method it shall deem fair and reasonable, Securities to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples of $1,000 only. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the Principal Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the Principal Amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
        SECTION 10.03
    Payment of Securities Called for Redemption.
    If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and, except as provided in Sections 5.05 and 11.06, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a Payment Office specified in said notice, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that any semi-annual payment of interest becoming due on the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant Interest Record Date subject to the terms and provisions of Section 2.04 hereof.
        If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate borne by the Security.
        Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations, in Principal Amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
        SECTION 11.01
    Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
    The Company may, at its option, by resolution of the Board of Directors, at any time, elect to have either Section 11.02 or Section 11.03 applied to the outstanding Securities upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 11.
        SECTION 11.02
    Legal Defeasance and Discharge.

For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 11.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 11.02, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following
provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (i) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 11.04 hereof, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities when such payments are due, (ii) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07(a), 2.08, 2.09, 2.11, and 11.05 hereof, (iii) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, including, without limitation, the Trustee's rights under Section 5.07 hereof, and the Company's obligations in connection therewith and with this Article 11. Subject to compliance with this Article 11, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 11.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 11.03 hereof with respect to the Securities.
        SECTION 11.03
    Covenant Defeasance.
    Upon the Company's exercise under Section 11.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 11.03, the Company shall be released from its obligations under the covenants contained in Article 3 and Section 9.01 hereof with respect to the outstanding Securities on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "
Covenant Defeasance
"), and the Securities shall thereafter be deemed not outstanding for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed outstanding for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 4.01(c) hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture, such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 11.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 11.03 and Section 4.01(d) hereof shall not constitute Events of Default.
        SECTION 11.04
    Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.
    The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 11.02 or Section 11.03 hereof to the outstanding Securities:
        (a)   The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 5.10 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Article 11 applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, (i) cash in U.S. Dollars in an amount, or (ii) non-callable Government Securities that through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, cash in U.S. Dollars in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such outstanding Securities on the stated maturity date of such principal or installment of principal, premium, if any, or interest.
        (b)   In the case of an election under Section 11.02 hereof, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that (i) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (ii) since the date hereof, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred.
        (c)   In the case of an election under Section 11.03 hereof, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred.
        (d)   No Default or Event of Default (or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as Section 4.01(e) or 4.01(f) hereof is concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 124th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period).
        (e)   Such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or is bound (other than a breach, violation or default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit).
        (f)    The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit made by the Company pursuant to its election under Section 11.02 or 11.03 hereof was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of the Securities over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company, or others.
        (g)   The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to either the Legal Defeasance under Section 11.02 hereof or the Covenant Defeasance under Section 11.03 hereof (as the case may be) have been complied with as contemplated by this Section 11.04.
        SECTION 11.05

    Subject to Section 11.06 hereof, all money and non-callable Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 11.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any paying agent (including the Company acting as paying agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal of, premium, if any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
        The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or non-callable Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 11.04 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge that by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Securities.
        Anything in this Article 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the Company's request any money or non-callable Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 11.04 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 11.04(a) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
        SECTION 11.06
    Repayment to the Company.
    Any money deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its written request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such paying agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such paying agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
        SECTION 11.07
    Reinstatement.
    If the Trustee or paying agent is unable to apply any U.S. Dollars or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 11.02 or 11.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 11.02 or 11.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or paying agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 11.02 or 11.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Security to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or paying agent.
        SECTION 12.01
    Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
    This Indenture shall upon a Company Request cease to be of further effect with respect to the Securities (except, as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer, exchange or conversion of Securities herein expressly provided for and any rights to receive payment of interest thereon), and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when:
        (a)   either
          (i)  all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (A) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.09, and (B) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been (x) deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 3.03(c) or (y) paid to any State or the District of Columbia pursuant to its unclaimed property or similar laws) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, as trust funds in trust for the purpose, money in the amount in the currency in which such Securities are payable, sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
        (b)   the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
        (c)   the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.

        SECTION 12.02
    Application of Trust Money.
    Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 3.03, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 12.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent), as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.
        SECTION 13.01
    Incorporators, Stockholders, Officers and Directors of Company Exempt from Individual Liability.

    Except as set forth in Section 13.09, nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, expressed or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their successors and the holders of the Securities, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture or under any covenant or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and of the holders of the Securities.

        Interest on the Securities will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve months of 30 days each.

Indenture
"), duly executed and delivered by the Company to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "
Trustee
"). Reference is hereby made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders (the words "
holders
" or "
holder
" meaning the registered holders or registered holder) of the Securities.
        This Security will bear interest until final maturity at a rate per annum shown above, except as provided in the next paragraph. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve months of 30 days each. The Company will pay interest on overdue principal of, premium, if any, and to the extent lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest, at the same rate.
        In the event that a Registration Default (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) occurs, then the Company will pay additional interest (in addition to the interest otherwise due hereon) ("
Additional Interest
") to the holder during the period immediately following the occurrence of any such Registration Default in an amount equal to 0.25% per annum (regardless of the number of Registration Defaults) from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur (subject to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement) to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured. The Company shall pay amounts due in respect of Additional Interest on each Interest Payment Date (or, if the Company shall default in the payment of interest on any Interest Payment Date, on the date such interest is otherwise paid as provided in the Indenture).

The Indenture provides that in certain events such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities then outstanding and that, prior to any such declaration, such holders may waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences except a default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Security and any Security which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Security or such other Securities.
        The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Securities.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Securities, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities, to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to holders of Securities in the case of a transaction described in Section 9.01, to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Securities or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the
Indenture of any such holder, or to comply with requirements of the Commission (as defined in the Indenture) in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act (as defined in the Indenture).
        No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the place, times, and rate, and in the currency, herein prescribed.

J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 270 Park Avenue New York, New York 10017
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        
The Home Depot, Inc.
, a Delaware corporation (the "
Company
"), proposes to issue and sell to Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets LLC (together, the "
Initial Purchasers
"), upon the terms set forth in a purchase agreement of even date herewith (the "
Purchase Agreement
"), $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% Senior Notes due September 15, 2009 (the "
Initial Securities
"). The Initial Securities will be issued pursuant to an indenture, to be dated as of September 16, 2004, (the "
Indenture
"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation, as trustee (the "
Trustee
"). As an inducement to the Initial Purchasers to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the Company agrees with the Initial Purchasers, for the benefit of the holders of the Initial Securities (including, without limitation, the Initial Purchasers), the Exchange Securities (as defined below) and any Private Exchange Securities (as defined below) (collectively the "
Holders
"), as follows:
        1.     
Registered Exchange Offer
.  Unless not permitted by applicable law (after the Company has complied with the ultimate paragraph of this Section 1), the Company shall prepare and, not later than 90 days (such 90th day being a "
Filing Deadline
") after the date on which the Initial Purchasers purchase the Initial Securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (the "
Closing Date
"), file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
Commission
") a registration statement (the "
Exchange Offer Registration Statement
") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
Securities Act
"), with respect to a proposed offer (the "
Registered Exchange Offer
") to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof), who are not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer, to issue and deliver to such Holders, in exchange for the Initial Securities, a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities of the Company issued under the Indenture, identical in all material respects to the Initial Securities (except for the transfer restrictions relating to the Initial Securities) and registered under the Securities Act (the "
Exchange Securities
"). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act within 180 days after the Closing Date (such 180th day being an "
Effectiveness Deadline
") and (ii) keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective for not less than 20 business days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice of the Registered Exchange Offer is mailed to the Holders (such period being called the "
Exchange Offer Registration Period
").
        If the Company commences the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company (i) will be entitled to consummate the Registered Exchange Offer 30 days after such commencement (provided that the Company has accepted all the Initial Securities theretofore validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Registered Exchange Offer) and (ii) will be required to consummate the Registered Exchanged Offer no later than 40 days after the date on which the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective (such 40th day being the "
Consummation Deadline
").
        Following the declaration of the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly commence the Registered Exchange Offer, it being the objective of such Registered Exchange Offer to enable each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof) electing to exchange Initial Securities for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, acquires the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business, has no arrangements with any person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Securities and is not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer) to trade such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the Securities Act (other than the prospectus delivery requirements referred to in clause (i) of the next paragraph, if and to the extent applicable) and without material restrictions under the securities laws of the several states of the United States.
        The Company acknowledges that, pursuant to current interpretations by the Commission's staff of Section 5 of the Securities Act, in the absence of an applicable exemption therefrom, (i) each Holder that is a broker-dealer electing to exchange Initial Securities, acquired for its own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities, for Exchange Securities (an "
Exchanging Dealer
"), is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information set forth in (a) Annex A hereto on the cover, (b) Annex B hereto in the "
Exchange Offer Procedures
" section and the "
Purpose of the Exchange Offer
" section, and (c) Annex C hereto in the "
Plan of Distribution
" section of such prospectus in connection with a sale of any such Exchange Securities received by such Exchanging Dealer pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and (ii) an Initial Purchaser that elects to sell Private Exchange Securities (as defined below) acquired in exchange for Initial Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information required by Items 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, as applicable, in connection with such sale.
        The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the prospectus contained therein, in order to permit such prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such period of time as such persons must comply with such requirements in order to resell the Exchange Securities;
provided
,
however
, that (i) in the case where such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto must be delivered by an Exchanging Dealer or an Initial Purchaser, such period shall be the lesser of 135 days and the date on which all Exchanging Dealers and the Initial Purchasers have sold all Exchange Securities held by them (unless such period is extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) and (ii) the Company shall make such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any resale of any Exchange Securities for a period of not less than 135 days after the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer.
        If, upon consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer, any Initial Purchaser holds Initial Securities acquired by it as part of its initial distribution, the Company, simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Securities pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, shall issue and deliver to such Initial Purchaser upon the written request of such Initial Purchaser, in exchange (the "
Private Exchange
") for (a) the Initial Securities held by such Initial Purchaser, a like principal amount of debt securities of the Company issued under the Indenture and identical in all material respects (including
the existence of restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act and the securities laws of the several states of the United States) to the Initial Securities (the "
Private Exchange Securities
"). The Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities and the Private Exchange Securities are herein collectively called the "
Securities
".
        In connection with the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
        (a)   mail to each Holder a copy of the definitive prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents;
        (b)   keep the Registered Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 business days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice thereof is mailed to the Holders;
        (c)   utilize the services of a depositary for the Registered Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which may be the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee;
        (d)   permit Holders to withdraw tendered Securities at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last business day on which the Registered Exchange Offer shall remain open; and
        (e)   otherwise comply with all applicable laws.
        As soon as practicable after the close of the Registered Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, as the case may be, the Company shall:
        (x)   accept for exchange all the Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange;
        (y)   deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all the Initial Securities so accepted for exchange; and
        (z)   cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of the Initial Securities, Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the Initial Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange.
        The Indenture will provide that the Exchange Securities will not be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and that all the Securities will vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Securities will have the right to vote or consent as a class separate from one another on any matter.
        Interest on each Exchange Security and Private Exchange Security issued pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and in the Private Exchange will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the Initial Securities surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on the Initial Securities, from the date of original issue of the Initial Securities.
        Each Holder participating in the Registered Exchange Offer shall be required to represent to the Company in writing that at the time of the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer (i) any Exchange Securities received by such Holder will be acquired in the ordinary course of business, (ii) such Holder will have no arrangements or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the Initial Securities or the Exchange Securities within the meaning of the Securities Act, (iii) such Holder is not an "affiliate," as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, of the Company or if it is an affiliate, such Holder will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable, (iv) such Holder is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of the Exchange Securities and (v) if such Holder is a broker-dealer, that it will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Initial
Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
        Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the Company will ensure that (i) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any prospectus forming part thereof and any supplement thereto complies as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any prospectus forming part of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and any supplement to such prospectus, does not as of its date include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
        2.     
Shelf Registration
.  If, (i) because of any change in law or in applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the Commission, the Company is not permitted to effect a Registered Exchange Offer, as contemplated by Section 1 hereof, (ii) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated within 220 days of the Closing Date, (iii) any Initial Purchaser so requests within 10 business days following consummation of the Registration Exchange Offer with respect to the Initial Securities not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Securities in the Registered Exchange Offer (or the Private Exchange Securities) and held by it following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer or (iv) any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (other than an Exchanging Dealer) shall notify the Company within 10 business days following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer that it is not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer or, in the case of any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Securities on the date of the exchange, the Company shall take the following actions (the date on which any of the conditions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) occur, including in the case of clauses (iii) or (iv) the receipt of the required notice, being a "
Trigger Date
"):
        (a)   The Company shall, at its cost, as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 90 days after the Trigger Date (such 90th day being a "
Filing Deadline
")) file with the Commission and thereafter shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective no later than 180 days after the Trigger Date (such 180th day being an "
Effective Deadline
") a registration statement (the "
Shelf Registration Statement
" and, together with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a "
Registration Statement
") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act relating to the offer and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof) by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415 under the Securities Act (hereinafter, the "
Shelf Registration
");
provided
,
however
, that no Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) shall be entitled to have the Transfer Restricted Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder (i) agrees in writing to be bound by all the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder and (ii) provides the Company in writing with the information required by Section 3(n).
        (b)   The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus included therein to be lawfully delivered by the Holders of the relevant Transfer Restricted Securities for a period of two years (or for such longer period if extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) from the date of its effectiveness or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement (i) have been sold pursuant thereto or (ii) are no longer restricted securities (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule thereof); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to keep the Shelf Registration
Statement continuously effective to the extent set forth above, or to keep the prospectus included therein usable for offers and sales of Securities, if (i) the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, upon the advice of counsel, that the continued effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement or usability of any prospectus included therein would (x) require the disclosure of material information, which the Company has a bona fide business reason for preserving as confidential, or (y) interfere with any financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction or development involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the contemplated timing thereof, and (ii) the Company promptly thereafter complies with the requirements of Section 3(j) hereof, if applicable. The number of days of any actual Suspension Period (as defined below) shall be added on to the end of the two-year period specified above. Any such period during which the Company is excused from keeping the Shelf Registration Statement effective and the prospectus included therein usable for offers and sales of Securities is referred to herein as a "
Suspension Period.
" A Suspension Period shall commence on and include the date that the Company gives notice that the Shelf Registration Statement is no longer effective or the prospectus included therein is no longer usable for offers and sales of Securities and shall end on the earlier to occur of (1) the date on which each seller of Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement either receives the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(j) hereof or is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and (2) the occurrence of a Suspension Period Limit (as defined below). There shall be no more than three Suspension Periods in any 12-month period, the aggregate number of days of such Suspension Periods shall not exceed 90 days in such 12 month period (collectively, the "
Suspension Period Limits
") and no Suspension Period shall exceed 60 days. The Company shall be deemed not to have used its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the requisite period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Securities during that period, unless such action is required by applicable law.
        (c)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement, amendment or supplement, (i) to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission and (ii) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

        (l)    The Company will comply with all rules and regulations of the Commission to the extent and so long as they are applicable to the Registered Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration and will make generally available to its security holders (or otherwise provide in accordance with Section 11(a) of the Securities Act) an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, no later than 45 days after the end of a 12-month period (or 90 days, if such period is a fiscal year) beginning with the first month of the Company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which statement shall cover such 12-month period.
        (m)  The Company shall cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, in a timely manner and containing such changes, if any, as shall be necessary for such qualification. In the event that such qualification would require the appointment of a new trustee under the Indenture, the Company shall appoint a new trustee thereunder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture.
        (n)   The Company may require each Holder of Securities to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information, including the information specified in Item 507 or Item 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, under the Securities Act, regarding the Holder and the distribution of the Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, and the Company may exclude from such registration the Securities of any Holder that fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request. The failure to include in the Shelf Registration Statement any Holder who shall have not provided all such information shall not constitute a Registration Default (as defined in Section 6(a) hereof). The Company may require each Holder as to which a Shelf Registration Statement is effected to furnish, update or confirm promptly to the Company information regarding the Holder and the distribution of Securities required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading.
        (o)   The Company shall enter into such customary agreements (including, if requested, an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other action, if any, as any Holder of the Securities shall reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Securities pursuant to any Shelf Registration.
        (p)   In the case of any Shelf Registration, the Company shall (i) upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, make reasonably available for inspection by any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by such Holders of the Securities or any such underwriter all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's officers, directors, employees, accountants and auditors to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, in each case, as shall be reasonably necessary to enable such persons, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act;
provided
,
however
, that any information that is designated in writing by the Company in good faith as confidential at the time of delivery of such information shall be kept confidential by such Holder or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent, unless such disclosure is made in the public generally or through a third party without an accompanying obligation of confidentiality; and
provided
,
further
, that the foregoing inspection and information gathering shall be coordinated on behalf of the Initial Purchasers by you and on behalf of the other parties, by one counsel designated by and on behalf of such other parties as described in Section 4 hereof.
        (q)   In the case of any Shelf Registration, the Company, if requested by any Holder of Securities covered thereby, shall cause (i) its counsel to deliver an opinion and updates thereof relating to the Securities in customary form and substance substantially similar to that customarily delivered in public offerings of Securities addressed to such Holders and the managing underwriters, if any, thereof and dated, in the case of the initial opinion, the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement; (ii) its officers to execute and deliver all customary documents and certificates and updates thereof requested by any underwriters of the applicable Securities and (iii) its independent public accountants to provide to the selling Holders of the applicable Securities and any underwriter therefor a comfort letter in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in comfort letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings, subject to receipt of appropriate documentation as contemplated, and only if permitted, by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 72.
        (r)   In the case of the Registered Exchange Offer, if requested by any Initial Purchaser or any known Participating Broker-Dealer, the Company shall cause (i) its counsel to deliver to such Initial Purchaser or such Participating Broker-Dealer a signed opinion in the form set forth in Section 6(c) of the Purchase Agreement with such changes as are customary in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement and (ii) its independent public accountants to deliver to such Initial Purchaser or such Participating Broker-Dealer a comfort letter, in customary form, meeting the requirements as to the substance thereof as set forth in Section 6(a) of the Purchase Agreement, with appropriate date changes.
        (s)   If a Registered Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange is to be consummated, upon delivery of the Initial Securities by Holders to the Company (or to such other Person as directed by the Company) in exchange for the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall mark, or cause to be marked, on the Initial Securities so exchanged that such Initial Securities are being canceled in exchange for the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be; in no event shall the Initial Securities be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied.
        (t)    The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) if the Initial Securities have been rated prior to the initial sale of such Initial Securities, confirm such ratings will apply to the Securities covered by a Registration Statement, or (ii) if the Initial Securities were not previously rated, cause the Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be rated with the appropriate
rating agencies, if so requested by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities covered by such Registration Statement, or by the managing underwriters, if any.
        (u)   In the event that any broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act shall underwrite any Securities to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or participate as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or "assist in the distribution" (within the meaning of the Conduct Rules (the "
Rules
") of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("
NASD
")) thereof, whether as a Holder of such Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, the Company will assist such broker-dealer in complying with the requirements of such Rules, including, without limitation, by (i) if such Rules, including Rule 2720, shall so require, engaging a "qualified independent underwriter" (as defined in Rule 2720) to participate in the preparation of the Registration Statement relating to such Securities, to exercise usual standards of due diligence in respect thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by such Registration Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales agent, to recommend the yield of such Securities, (ii) indemnifying any such qualified independent underwriter to the extent of the indemnification of underwriters provided in Section 5 hereof and (iii) providing such information to such broker-dealer as may be required in order for such broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of the Rules.
        (v)   The Company shall use its best efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the registration of the Securities covered by a Registration Statement contemplated hereby.
        4.     
Registration Expenses
.  (a) All expenses incident to the Company's performance of and compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Company, regardless of whether a Registration Statement is ever filed or becomes effective, including without limitation:
          (i)  all registration and filing fees and expenses;
         (ii)  all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state "blue sky" or securities laws;
        (iii)  all expenses of printing (including printing certificates for the Securities to be issued in the Registered Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange and printing of prospectuses), messenger and delivery services and telephone;
        (iv)  all fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company;
         (v)  all application and filing fees in connection with listing the Exchange Securities on a national securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements hereof; and
        (vi)  all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of the Company (including the expenses of any special audit and comfort letters required by or incident to such performance).
        The Company will bear its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expenses of any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any person, including special experts, retained by the Company.
        (b)   In connection with any Registration Statement required by this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers and the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities who are tendering Initial Securities in the Registered Exchange Offer and/or selling or reselling Securities pursuant to the "Plan of Distribution" contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, for the reasonable fees and disbursements (which fees and disbursements shall be limited to $10,000) of not more than one counsel, who shall be
Davis Polk & Wardwell unless another firm shall be chosen by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities for whose benefit such Registration Statement is being prepared.
        5.     
Indemnification
.  (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of the Securities and any Participating Broker-Dealer and each person, and their respective officers, members, directors and, in the case of transactions pursuant to Section 3(o) hereof, underwriters and each person who controls such Holder or such Participating Broker-Dealer within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each Holder, any Participating Broker-Dealer and such controlling persons are referred to collectively as the "
Indemnified Parties
") from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, or any actions in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions relating to purchases and sales of the Securities) to which each Indemnified Party may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of, or are based upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and shall reimburse, as incurred, the Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof,
provided
,
however
, that (i) the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party or any affiliate thereof specifically for inclusion therein and (ii) with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration Statement, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Securities concerned (or any affiliate of such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer), to the extent that a prospectus relating to such Securities was required to be delivered by such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer under the Securities Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer or any affiliate thereof results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person, a copy of the final prospectus if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer;
provided further
,
however
, that this indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to such Indemnified Party. The Company shall also indemnify underwriters, their officers, members and directors and each person who controls such underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders of the Securities if requested by such Holders.
        (b)   Each Holder of the Securities, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities or any actions in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf
Registration, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein; and, subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, shall reimburse, as incurred, the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Holder may otherwise have to the Company or any of its controlling persons.
        (c)   Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including a governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that its failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above or this subsection. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action, and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
        (d)   If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from the exchange of the Securities, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the applicable Registration Statement or prospectus, or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Holder or such other indemnified party, as the case may be, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5(d), the Holders of the Securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holders from the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such Holders have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph (d), each person, if any, who controls such indemnified party within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such indemnified party and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
        (e)   The agreements contained in this Section 5 shall survive the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
        6.     
Additional Interest Under Certain Circumstances
.  (a) Additional interest (the "
Additional Interest
") with respect to the Initial Securities and the Private Exchange Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (iv) below a "
Registration Default
"):
          (i)  any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the applicable Filing Deadline;
         (ii)  any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the applicable Effectiveness Deadline;
        (iii)  the Registered Exchange Offer has not been consummated on or prior to the Consummation Deadline; or
        (iv)  any Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective by the Commission but (A) such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective or (B) such Registration Statement or the related prospectus ceases to be usable in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified herein because either (1) any event occurs as a result of which the related prospectus forming part of such Registration Statement would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or (2) it shall be necessary to amend such Registration Statement or supplement the related prospectus, to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder.
        Each of the foregoing will constitute a Registration Default whatever the reason for any such event and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is beyond the control of the Company or pursuant to operation of law or as a result of any action or inaction by the Commission.
        Additional Interest shall accrue on the Securities over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Securities from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults have been cured, at a rate of 0.25% per annum (the "
Additional Interest Rate
") (regardless of the number of Registration Defaults).
        (b)   A Registration Default referred to in Section 6(a)(iii) hereof shall be deemed not to have occurred and be continuing in relation to a Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus during any Suspension Period if (i) such Registration Default has occurred solely as a result of (x) the filing of a post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited financial information with respect to the Company where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related prospectus or (y) other material events, with respect to the Company that would need to be described in such Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus and (ii) in the case of clause (y), the Company is proceeding promptly and in good faith to amend or supplement such Shelf Registration Statement and related prospectus to describe such events;
provided
,
however
, that in any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 30 days, Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with the above paragraph from the day such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured.
        (c)   Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to Section 6(a) above will be payable in cash on the regular interest payment dates with respect to the Securities. The amount of Additional Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional Interest rate by the principal amount of the Initial Securities or Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and the denominator of which is 360.
        (d)   "
Transfer Restricted Securities
" means each Security until (i) the date on which such Security has been exchanged by a person other than a broker-dealer for a freely transferable Exchange Security in the Registered Exchange Offer, (ii) following the exchange by a broker-dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer of an Initial Security for an Exchange Security, the date on which such Exchange Security is sold to a purchaser who receives from such broker-dealer on or prior to the date of such sale a copy of the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, (iii) the date on which such Security has been effectively registered under the Securities Act and disposed of in accordance with the Shelf Registration Statement or (iv) the date on which such Security is distributed to the public pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or is saleable pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act.
        7.     
Rules 144 and 144A
.  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A. The Company covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Transfer Restricted Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)). The Company will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Initial Securities identified to the Company by the Initial Purchasers upon request. Upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act.
        8.     
Underwritten Registrations
.  If any of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering ("
Managing Underwriters
") will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in such offering (subject to the approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the Company).
        No person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

affiliates solely by reason of their holdings of such Securities) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage.

This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Company has agreed that, for a period of 135 days after the Expiration Date, it will make this prospectus, as amended or supplemented, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale.

        The Company will not receive any proceeds from any sale of Exchange Securities by broker-dealers. Exchange Securities received by broker-dealers for their own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer may be sold from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the Exchange Securities or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer or the purchasers of any such Exchange Securities. Any broker-dealer that resells Exchange Securities that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such Exchange Securities may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and any profit on any such resale of Exchange Securities and any commission or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities Act. The Letter of Transmittal states that, by acknowledging that it will deliver and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act.

In addition, the legend required by Item 502(e) of Regulation S-K will appear on the back cover page of the Exchange Offer prospectus.
        For a period of 135 days after the Expiration Date the Company will promptly send additional copies of this Prospectus and any amendment or supplement to this Prospectus to any broker-dealer that requests such documents in the Letter of Transmittal. The Company has agreed to pay all expenses incident to the Exchange Offer (including the expenses of one counsel for the Holders of the Securities) other than commissions or concessions of any brokers or dealers and will indemnify the Holders of the Securities (including any broker-dealer) against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
