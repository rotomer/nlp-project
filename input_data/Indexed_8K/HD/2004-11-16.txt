EXHIBIT 99.1 [HOME DEPOT LOGO] THE HOME DEPOT REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS, INCREASES FISCAL 2004 EPS GROWTH GUIDANCE TO 19-20 PERCENT - Record EPS of $0.60, up 20% - Record Sales of $18.8 billion, up 13% - 4.5% Comparable Store Sales Growth - 11% Operating Margin - 21.4% Return on Invested Capital ATLANTA, November 16, 2004 -- The Home Depot(R), the world's largest home improvement retailer, today reported record third quarter fiscal 2004 net earnings of $1.3 billion, or $0.60 per diluted share, up 20 percent compared to $0.50 per diluted share for the third quarter fiscal 2003. Sales for the period increased $2.2 billion, or 13.1 percent, to $18.8 billion. Comparable store sales rose 4.5 percent. Based on the strong third quarter performance, the company announced that it is raising its fiscal 2004 earnings per share growth guidance from 14-17 percent to 19-20 percent. "The strength of our core retail business, coupled with our growing services and professional supply businesses, is delivering solid returns," said Bob Nardelli, chairman, president & CEO, The Home Depot. "Our business strategy of enhancing the core, extending the business and expanding our markets is clearly driving consistent, profitable sales growth. Additionally, in the face of a record number of hurricanes in the Southeast, our stores remained open and our associates and suppliers worked tirelessly to take care of our customers, and I want to thank them." The company ended the quarter with $39.6 billion in total assets, including $3.4 billion in cash and stockholders' equity of $23.7 billion. "Our solid financial results drove our return on invested capital to 21.4 percent, up 260 basis points from the third quarter last year," said Carol Tome, executive vice president, CFO, The Home Depot. "Our financial condition remains unparalleled in retail." ENHANCING THE CORE "Our results reflect our breadth of merchandise, the benefits of our store modernization program and support from our marketing initiatives," said John Costello, executive vice president of Merchandising and Marketing, The Home Depot. "This is evidenced by a 6.6 percent increase in our average ticket, which reached $55.53, a company record. We experienced average ticket growth across the store because of an enriched merchandising mix of products." Merchandising highlights in the quarter include: - Continued product innovation across both hardlines and decor, including Hampton Bay interior lighting and ceiling fans, Ryobi air grip laser level, Charmglow outdoor fireplace products, RIDGID titanium coated saw blades, Porter Cable compressor combo, Masonite doors and Trex composite decking - Record share in core appliances, up 40% over a year ago, and the tenth consecutive quarterly gain, supported by the rollout of GE Adora, the new Hotpoint Metallic Series and the Americana line - Continued store modernization, including the Ralph Lauren Color Center, the new Exterior Wood Care Center and resets across a variety of categories -more-
-2- - Expanded multi-channel retailing through homedepot.com, in-store special orders and catalogs - The nation's largest Tool Rental Center network, opening the 1,000th location EXTENDING THE BUSINESS During the quarter, the company opened 38 new stores, including two new urban format stores, one in New York City and one in Park Royal, West Vancouver, British Columbia. "These stores demonstrate another opportunity for new store growth by bringing The Home Depot to previously underserved customers and markets," added Costello. The company continued to extend its core business in the third quarter, growing services revenues by 26% to $957 million for the quarter. Services highlights include: - Offered 23 national installation programs, with plans for more - Continued strength in services such as carpet, countertops, kitchens and windows, with more than 11,000 installations each day EXPANDING MARKETS The company said that its recently acquired White Cap business is exceeding expectations, with strong sales, smooth integration and purchasing synergies. White Cap provides a platform for future growth to large- and mid-sized professional contractors, serving a $400 billion market. The company said that since the acquisition, White Cap has made three small bolt-on acquisitions and has grown organically by adding seven branches, bringing the total to 77 in 17 states. Canada and Mexico continue to represent significant growth opportunities for The Home Depot. "Our Mexico business is strong, with double-digit comp growth," said Nardelli. "The integration and re-branding of the Home Mart stores have gone extremely well. Today, we have 10 stores in Mexico City and 42 stores throughout the country. Housing is a clear priority in Mexico, and based upon my recent trip there, I am confident that we are well positioned in this $16 billion market." In September, The Home Depot marked its inaugural Week of Service with associate volunteers donating more than 260,000 hours, touching more than 1,200 communities and 1 million people throughout North America and China. In cooperation with the Departments of Defense, Labor and Veterans Affairs, the company launched Operation Career Front and has hired more than 10,000 veterans this year alone. "We were honored to have been recognized by Employer Support Guard and Reservists and the Department of Defense with the Freedom Award," said Nardelli. "And, just last week, we were ranked number one as the most military-friendly employer by GI Jobs magazine." The Home Depot will conduct a conference call today to discuss information included in this news release and related matters at 9:00 a.m. EST. The conference call will be available in its entirety through a Web cast at http://www.homedepot.com, and through replay at that site under the investor relations' section. -more-
-3- The adjusted earnings per share included in this press release is reconciled to the comparable generally accepted accounting principles amount in the attached schedule. In January 2004, the company adopted EITF 02-16 "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor." Management believes that excluding the impact of EITF 02-16 allows investors to compare the results of operations without giving effect to this new accounting standard. Founded in 1978, The Home Depot(R) is the world's largest home improvement specialty retailer and the second largest retailer in the United States, with fiscal 2003 sales of $64.8 billion. During the quarter, The Home Depot added 38 new stores. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the company operated a total of 1,826 stores, including 1,602 The Home Depot stores in the United States, 110 The Home Depot stores in Canada, and 42 The Home Depot stores in Mexico. The company also operates 54 EXPO Design Center locations, 11 The Home Depot Landscape Supply stores, five The Home Depot Supply stores, and two The Home Depot Floor Stores. The company employs approximately 300,000 associates and today has stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, eight Canadian provinces and Mexico. Its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: HD) and is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor's 500 Index. HDE Statements of The Home Depot's expectations for sales growth, earnings performance, capital expenditures, store openings and demand for services in this release constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based on currently available operating, financial and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's historical experience and its present expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in and the overall condition of the U.S. economy, stability of costs and availability of sourcing channels, conditions affecting new store development, the company's ability to integrate the businesses it acquires, the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from acquisitions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, the company's ability to implement new technologies and processes, the company's ability to attract, train and retain highly-qualified associates, unanticipated weather conditions, and the impact of competition and regulatory and litigation matters. Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements, as such statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Additional information regarding these and other risks is contained in the company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ### For more information, contact: Financial Community News Media Diane Dayhoff Jerry Shields Vice President, Investor Relations Senior Public Relations Manager (770) 384-2666 (770) 384-2741 diane_dayhoff@homedepot.com jerry_shields@homedepot.com

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE IMPACT OF EITF 02-16 * FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2004 AND NOVEMBER 2, 2003 (UNAUDITED) (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA AND AS OTHERWISE NOTED) * The table includes only those line items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings impacted by the adoption of EITF 02-16. In January 2004, the Company adopted EITF 02-16 "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor." The impact in the first nine months of fiscal 2004 in connection with the adoption of EITF 02-16 resulted in a reduction of Cost of Merchandise Sold of $650 million, an increase in Selling and Store Operating Expenses of $820 million and a reduction of Net Earnings of $108 million. The adoption of EITF 02-16 had a $0.05 per share impact on diluted earnings per share during the first nine months of the year. We do not expect any further impact on our diluted earnings per share from the adoption of EITF 02-16.
