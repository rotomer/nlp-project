She joined SC Johnson in September 1985 and was named vice president  Consumer Marketing Services, Worldwide in 1992 and vice president, Personal & Home Care Products  North America in 1997  and was the driving force behind that company's memorable "family company" advertising campaign. In March 1999, Helen was elected chairman and CEO of Johnson Outdoors Inc., a leading global outdoor recreational products company and, in July 2004, was also elected chairman, Johnson Financial Group, a $4 billion dollar global financial services company.
