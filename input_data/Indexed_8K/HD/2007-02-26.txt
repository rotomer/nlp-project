Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(d)           On November 16, 2006, the Company announced the election of Ms. Helen Johnson-Leipold as a director of the Company.  On February 21, 2007, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors appointed Ms. Johnson-Leipold to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the IT Advisory Council.
(e)           On February 22, 2007, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") approved a (i) Form of Performance Share Award, (ii) Form of Performance Vested Option Award and (iii) Form of Mexico Performance Share Award. These forms will be used to evidence grants of awards made under the Company's 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan. The full text of the form of each award is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 and is incorporated herein by reference.
On January 24, 2007, the Company announced that the Board would grant Frank Blake, the Company's Chairman and CEO, a performance share award to be paid out at the end of three years based on the Company's relative total shareholder return ("TSR") ranking compared to the TSR ranking of the individual companies included in the S&P 500, with a threshold payout of 25% of the award at the 26
th
 percentile and no payout for percentile rankings below the 26
th
 percentile.  On February 22, 2007, the Board approved Mr. Blake's performance share award and increased the minimum TSR percentile ranking at which a payout would be made from the 26th percentile to the 40th percentile and increased the payout upon the attainment of the minimum TSR percentile ranking from 25% to 50% of the award.
The performance share award provides for payout upon a change in control of the Company.  The number of shares awarded upon a change-in-control is determined based on actual results achieved through the date of the change in control, prorated based on the number of days in the performance period before the change in control, plus the target award amount, prorated based on the number of days in the performance period after the change in control. In addition, dividends will accrue on the performance share award and be paid upon the payout of the award to the extent the award is earned.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the exhibits.

Award
2.             .  Subject to Sections 4, 5 and 6, the Company shall deliver to you one share of Common Stock for each whole Performance Share that is earned in accordance with the following schedule, based on the percentile ranking of the Company's TSR for the Performance Period relative to the TSR of the S&P 500 for the Performance Period:
Performance Vesting
 
If the Company's relative TSR ranking is between the percentile rankings listed above, the percentage of the Target Award shall be interpolated, as set forth on Schedule A.  The percentile ranking is the percentage of S&P 500 companies with TSR for the Performance that is less than or equal to the Company's TSR.  If the Company's TSR is the same as another company's TSR, the Company shall be treated as having the higher TSR.  The percentile ranking shall be rounded to the nearest whole percentage, with (.50) rounded up.
3.             .  The number of shares of Common Stock that you earn under Section 2 will be delivered to you as soon as administratively practicable after the end of the Performance Period.

If your employment with the Company and its subsidiaries terminates during the Performance Period due to your death or Disability before Retirement Eligibility, you will be entitled to a prorated portion of the Performance Shares earned in accordance with Section 2, determined at the end of the Performance Period and based on the ratio of the
Death, Disability or Retirement
 
 
number of days you are employed during the Performance Period to the total number of days in the Performance Period.  Any payments due on your death shall be paid to your estate as soon as administratively practicable after the end of the Performance Period.
