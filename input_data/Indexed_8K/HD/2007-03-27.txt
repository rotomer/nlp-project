3.   Upon the event of the termination of your service on the Board of Directors of the Company (for any reason other than Retirement, death or permanent and total disability or Discharge for Cause), Option shares which have not become exercisable as of the date of such event shall immediately lapse. Option shares which are exercisable as of the date of termination of service on the Board will lapse unless exercised within a period of six (6) months of the date of termination of service. Upon the termination of your service on the Board upon Retirement, all stock options that are not exercisable as of the date of your Retirement shall continue to vest according to the schedule set forth in Paragraph 2 and all stock options shall remain exercisable until the Exp.

Option shares that are exercisable as of the date of termination of employment will lapse unless exercised within a period of three (3) months of the date of termination of employment. Upon the termination of your employment upon Retirement, all stock options that are not exercisable as of the date of your Retirement shall continue to vest according to the schedule set forth in Paragraph 2 and all stock options shall remain exercisable until the Exp. Date; provided, however, that if after reaching Retirement you become directly or indirectly employed by a Competitor, all unvested options shall immediately lapse.

5.   The exercisable portion of the Option may be exercised in whole or in part but in no event with respect to a fractional share from time to time until the Exp. Date.  Exercise shall be by notice of exercise to the Company, specifying the number of shares to be purchased, the Option Price of each share and the aggregate Option Price for all shares being purchased under said notice.  The notice shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Option Price for the number of shares purchased and any applicable withholding taxes.  Such exercise (subject to Paragraph 6 hereof) shall be effective upon the actual receipt of such payment and notice to the Company.  The aggregate Option Price for all shares purchased pursuant to an exercise of the Option shall be paid by check payable to the order of the Company, shares of Common Stock of the Company held by you for at least six (6) months, the fair market value of which at the time of such exercise is equal to the aggregate Option Price (or portion thereof to be paid with previously owned Common Stock).  Payment of the Option Price in shares of Common Stock shall be made by delivering properly endorsed stock certificates to the Company or otherwise causing such Common Stock to be transferred to the account of the Company, either physically or through attestation.  In addition, the aggregate Option Price for all shares purchased pursuant to an exercise of the Option may be paid from the proceeds of sale through a bank or broker on the date of exercise of some or all of the shares to which the exercise relates.  There shall be furnished with each notice of the exercise of any portion of the Option such documents as the Company in its discretion may deem necessary to assure compliance with applicable rules and regulations of any stock exchange or governmental authority.  No rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect to such shares issuable upon the exercise of any part of the Option shall accrue to you unless and until certificates representing such shares have been registered in your name.
6.   The Option shall not be exercised in whole or in part and no related share certificates shall be delivered in the sole discretion of the Company:  (a) if such exercise or delivery would constitute a violation of any provision of, or any regulation or order entered pursuant to, any law purporting to regulate wages, salaries or compensation; or (b) if any requisite approval, consent, registration or other qualification of any stock exchange upon which the securities of the Company may then be listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other governmental authority having jurisdiction over the exercise of the Option or the issuance of shares pursuant thereto, shall not have been secured.
7.   Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Option shall not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner, other than by will or under the laws of descent and distribution, whether by the operation of law or otherwise.  An option may be exercised, during your lifetime, only by you or your legal representative.  Upon any attempt to do anything prohibited by this paragraph, the Option shall immediately become null and void.

Nothing herein contained shall constitute an obligation for continued employment.
