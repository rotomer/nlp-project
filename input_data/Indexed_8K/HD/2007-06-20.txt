Disposition of HD Supply, Inc., CND Holdings, Inc. and related Intellectual Property
     
On June 19, 2007, The Home Depot, Inc. ("Home Depot"), THD Holdings, LLC, Home Depot International, Inc. and Homer TLC, Inc. (together, the "Sellers") entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement ("the Agreement") with Pro Acquisition Corporation, an affiliate of Clayton Dubilier & Rice, Carlyle Group and Bain Capital ("Purchaser"), by which Purchaser will acquire all of the capital stock of HD Supply, Inc. and CND Holdings, Inc. (the "Transferred Companies"), and certain intellectual property rights, for an aggregate purchase price of $10.325 billion.
     
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Transferred Companies are to be sold on a debt-free, cash-free basis, and the purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustment to the extent that closing date working capital differs from a targeted amount. The closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including the termination or expiration of any Hart-Scott-Rodino or Competition Act (Canada) waiting period and is expected to close in the third fiscal quarter of 2007. The transaction is not conditioned upon financing.
     
The Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion of the sale by mutual consent, and by either party if the closing does not occur within six months of June 19, 2007. Either party may, however, extend this period for an additional three months if the reason for delay is failure to obtain regulatory approval (the "Outside Date"). The Agreement contains customary termination rights based on breaches of representations or covenants subject to the materiality standards of the Agreement and rights of the parties to cure such breaches.
     
A termination fee of $309,750,000 is payable by the Purchaser to Home Depot under the following circumstances: (1) if either party terminates the Agreement by the Outside Date because of the failure to obtain antitrust approvals; (2) if Home Depot terminates the Agreement as a result of an uncured breach or failure to perform by Purchaser of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements, subject to the materiality standards in the Agreement; or (3) if Home Depot terminates the Agreement as a result of Purchaser's breach of its obligations to effect the closing (including a failure to obtain financing).
     
The parties agreed to a three-year non-compete provision whereby Home Depot has agreed not to acquire certain companies and to restrictions on the use of HD Supply customer data, and a non-solicit provision pursuant to which Home Depot has agreed not to hire certain employees of the Transferred Companies.
     
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement included as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference and the Press Release of Home Depot included as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
     
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Section 2.3

Sections 8.1
and
8.2
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing) and (z) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter are available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall draw down on such bridge facilities to replace the high yield financing or portion thereof t hat has not been consummated no later than the time Purchaser is obligated to close pursuant to the terms hereof.

Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (x) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Financing or reduces the amount thereof, or (y) terminate or permit termination of any of the Commitment Letters. In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, regardless of the reason therefor, Purchaser will (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount suff icient, when taken together with the proceeds from the Cash Equity, to pay the Purchase Price including any adjustments thereto) on terms no less favorable than those in the Debt Commitment Letters, including from other sources, and which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous than the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, and (ii) promptly notify Parent of such unavailability and the reason therefor.

In such event, the term "Commitment Letters" as used herein shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letters that are not so superseded at the time in question and the New Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Purchaser with this
Section 5.3(d)

The Home Depot Announces Agreement to Sell HD Supply to Private Equity Group for $10.3 Billion and $22.5 Billion Increase in Share Repurchase Authorization
ATLANTA, June 19, 2007 -- The Home Depot(R), the world's largest home improvement retailer, today announced that its board of directors has approved strategic measures to enhance shareholder value. These measures include entering into an agreement to sell HD Supply and the execution of a recapitalization plan.

)
Sale of HD Supply
In February 2007, The Home Depot began a strategic review of HD Supply, the Company's wholesale distribution division, in an effort to increase the Company's focus on its core retail business. After a thorough review of alternatives, the board unanimously approved the sale of HD Supply to private equity firms Bain Capital Partners, The Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice for $10.3 billion. Subject to certain regulatory requirements and contingencies, the sale of HD Supply is expected to close in the third fiscal quarter of 2007. The transaction is not conditioned upon financing.
"HD Supply is a leader in its industry. We are proud of the business we built and know that it will continue to grow and flourish under new ownership," said Frank Blake, chairman and CEO. "I'd like to thank Joe DeAngelo and the entire HD Supply leadership team for their contributions to The Home Depot."
"Today's decision reflects our continued commitment to enhancing shareholder value, through an exclusive focus on our retail business and the return of cash to our shareholders. This year alone we will spend over $2 billion in support of our top five retail priorities. We are confident in the ability to improve productivity in our retail business through investment in these priorities, which will further enhance returns on invested capital as the investments take hold," said Blake, chairman and CEO.
"Through the hard work and dedication of HD Supply's 26,000 associates, we have built a business that sets the standard in the industry," said Joe DeAngelo, COO and executive vice president. "We've got a bright future ahead and we're confident we'll continue to prosper."
Recapitalization Plan
The board of directors also authorized a $22.5 billion increase in its share repurchase program. It is the Company's intent to repurchase up to $22.5 billion in shares as soon as practicable. The Company will fund the $22.5 billion share repurchase with the net proceeds from the sale of HD Supply, existing cash on hand and the net proceeds from an anticipated $12 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes. The $22.5 billion share repurchase may be in the form of a tender offer, open market repurchases or accelerated share repurchases, the details of which will be announced at a later date.
"Our planned recapitalization is transformational for our company. While we continue to invest heavily in the five priorities focused on our core retail business, this recapitalization plan allows us to return significant capital to our shareholders, improve the efficiency of our balance sheet by lowering our cost of capital, while at the same time retaining strong financial and operational flexibility," said Carol Tome, CFO and executive vice president - Corporate Services.
Capital Allocation Philosophy
Combined with today's announcements, the Company reiterated its capital allocation principles:
,
-- Dividend Principle: Deliver a predictable increase each year
targeting payout at approximately 30%
--  Share Repurchase Principle: After meeting the needs of the business, priority 
use excess liquidity to repurchase shares, with value creation as the
--  Return on Invested Capital Principle: Maintain a high return on value created for shareholders through share repurchases
invested capital, benchmarking all uses of excess liquidity against
Targeted Capital Structure
The Company announced that its targeted capital structure will be to maintain an average total adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio of 2.5x. Total adjusted debt includes debt on the balance sheet plus 8x operating rents and EBITDAR is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent expense.
"By targeting debt levels relative to the underlying cash flow generation of the business (EBITDAR), our ongoing financing plans will support our retail business. We are confident in our ability to sustain strong cash flow generation and the financial flexibility necessary to continue executing our business strategy as well as returning cash to shareholders through dividends and repurchases," said Tome.
Lehman Brothers served as the Company's exclusive financial advisor for the strategic review of HD Supply and the recapitalization plan. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as the Company's legal advisor.
2007 Guidance
At the end of the first quarter of 2007, the Company said that it expected consolidated sales including HD Supply to increase by 1-2% in fiscal 2007 and earnings per share, on a 52 week basis, to decline by 9%. To reflect the impact of the HD Supply discontinued operation, the Company plans to update its fiscal 2007 sales and earnings per share growth guidance in July 2007.
The Company will hold a conference call on Wednesday, June 20, at 11:30 a.m. ET to discuss this announcement. The conference call will be available in its entirety through a webcast and replay at homedepot.com in the Investor Relations section.
The Home Depot(R) is the world's largest home improvement specialty retailer, with 2,184 retail stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, 10 Canadian provinces, Mexico and China. In fiscal 2006, The Home Depot had sales of $90.8 billion and earnings of $5.8 billion. The Company employs approximately 364,000 associates. The Home Depot's stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: HD) and is included in the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index. HDG
This release includes certain supplemental financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP measures include total adjusted debt and EBITDAR. This supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP measures of debt. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides meaningful information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's targeted capital structure and expected operating performance. Management targets the Company's debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to structure debt levels relative to the underlying cash flow generation (EBITDAR) of the business.

These statements are based on currently available information and are based on our current expectations and projections about future events.
