An option may be exercised, during your lifetime, only by you or your legal representative.

In the event you wish to enter into any relationship or employment before the end of the above-referenced 24 month period which would be covered by the above non-compete provision, you agree to request written permission from the Company's Executive Vice President, Human Resources before entering any such relationship or employment. The Company may approve or not approve of the relationship or employment at its absolute discretion. You agree that while you are employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and for a period of 36 months subsequent to the termination of your employment, you will not directly or indirectly solicit any person who is an employee of the Company to terminate his or her relationship with the Company without prior written approval from the Company's Executive Vice President, Human Resources.]

.
11. [: The Company shall not limit your rights to be employed by or engaged in any business or other activities except as specifically set forth herein. You acknowledge that during your employment with the Company, you have had access to and acquired the Company's privileged and Confidential Information on a very wide range of issues and subject matter of concern to the Company, and that it would be impossible for you to provide legal services or advice to a Competitor on the great majority of subjects without creating a conflict of interest with respect to the Company as your former client by using, relying on or disclosing this Confidential Information in violation of your ethical obligations referred to above. You agree that given these circumstances it is reasonable that while you are employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and for 24 months subsequent to the termination of your employment, you will not provide legal services or advice, either directly or indirectly, to any Competitor without the prior written consent of the Company, regardless of whether the services are provided through a direct employment or contractual relationship with a Competitor or through a law firm, consulting firm, or any other entity that provides legal services or advice to a Competitor of the Company. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit you from working for a law firm, consulting firm, or any other entity that represents or advises a Competitor so long as you personally provide no services or advice to such competitor, or to other persons working within that entity with respect to such Competitor, before the end of the above-referenced 24 month period. In the event

Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
.
 
you wish to enter into any relationship or employment before the end of the above-referenced 24 month period which would be covered by the above non-compete and/or non-disclosure or conflict of interest provisions, you agree to request written consent and a waiver of the aforementioned conflict of interest from the Company's General Counsel before entering any such relationship or employment. The Company may consent or not consent to the relationship or employment at its absolute discretion. Alternatively, in the event that you believe that such new relationship or employment, despite being with or for a Competitor, is not with respect to any matter that is substantially related to any work done for the Company and therefore does not implicate the conflict of interest provisions, or otherwise does not present a situation in which you would use Confidential Information in such a way as to benefit a person other than the Company, you agree to inform the Company's General Counsel of the basis for that conclusion and to request the Company's agreement. The Company may reasonably request further information, but will not unreasonably withhold its agreement to such a request by you. You further agree that while you are employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and for a period of 36 months subsequent to the termination of your employment, you will not directly or indirectly solicit any person who is an employee of the Company to terminate his or her relationship with the Company without prior written approval from the Company's Executive Vice President, Human Resources.]
