On June 2, 2011, the Board of Directors of The Home Depot, Inc. (the "Company") approved amendments to the Company's By-Laws. The amendments are effective as of June 2, 2011.
A new Section 11 of Article I was added to the By-Laws to provide the procedures for shareholder action by written consent, in accordance with the amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation approved by the Company's shareholders at the 2011 Annual Meeting on June 2, 2011. In addition, Article I, Sections 1 and 2 were amended to clarify the requirements for a shareholder to make nominations for director and proposals of other business at an annual or special meeting of shareholders. Article I was further amended to consolidate into one section (Section 4) the required information that must be provided by a shareholder to the Company pursuant to the advance notice procedures and to make the requirements consistent for all types of shareholder notice (in connection with annual or special meetings, requests for special meetings or actions by written consent). The information requirements were also revised to clarify the types of derivative instruments and other economic interests that must be disclosed by a shareholder who submits a nomination or proposal for other business. Further non-substantive revisions were made to Article I as a result of the reorganization of the Article described above and related conforming changes.
The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-Laws of the Company (As Amended and Restated Effective June 2, 2011), attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 3.1
 
SECTION l. ANNUAL MEETINGS. (a) The annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of Directors and for the transaction of such other business as shall have been properly brought before the meeting shall be held on such date and at such time and place as the Board of Directors may by resolution provide. At any annual meeting of the shareholders, only such nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors shall be made, and only such other business shall be conducted or considered, as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. For nominations to be properly made at an annual meeting and proposals of other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting, nominations and proposals of other business must be (1) specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (2) otherwise properly made at or brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (3) otherwise properly requested to be made at or brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder of the Corporation in accordance with these By-Laws and the Certificate of Incorporation. For nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or proposals of other business to be properly requested by a shareholder to be made at or brought before an annual meeting, a shareholder must (i) be a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice of such annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors and at the time of the annual meeting, (ii) be entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (iii) comply with the procedures set forth in these By-Laws and the Certificate of Incorporation as to such nomination or business. The immediately preceding sentence shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make nominations at or bring other business proposals before an annual meeting of shareholders (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and included in the Corporation's notice of meeting).
(b) Without qualification or limitation, for any nominations or any other business to be properly made at or brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to this Section 1, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof, which notice must comply with the requirements of Article I, Section 4 hereof (including, in the case of nominations, timely delivery of the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Article I, Section 4(c) of these By-Laws), and timely updates and supplements thereof, in writing to the Secretary, and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action under applicable law. For any notice of a nomination to be timely, a shareholder's notice must comply with the Certificate of Incorporation and must include the information set forth in Article I, Section 4 of these By-Laws. For notice of any other business to be timely, a shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day and not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the public announcement thereof, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. For purposes of these By-Laws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
In addition, to be considered timely, a shareholder's notice shall further be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct as of
 
the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation by the later of five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting or the deadline for the delivery of the shareholder's notice, in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date, and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Any notice of a nomination given pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation shall include a representation that the shareholder will properly notify the Corporation in writing of any subsequent change in the information provided or required to be provided.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1, if the shareholder (or a Qualified Representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to present an item of business or is no longer a holder of record on the date of such meeting, such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For the purposes of these By-Laws, to be considered a "Qualified Representative" of the shareholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such shareholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as proxy at the meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders.
SECTION 2. SPECIAL MEETINGS. (a) Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time only by the Chairman of the Board or the Board of Directors, or by the shareholders of the Corporation following receipt by the Secretary of the Corporation of a written request for a special meeting (a "Special Meeting Request") from the record holders of shares representing at least 25% of the outstanding common stock of the Corporation (the "Requisite Holders") if such Special Meeting Request complies with the requirements set forth in this Section 2. The Board of Directors shall determine whether all such requirements have been satisfied, and such determination shall be binding on the Corporation and its shareholders. If a Special Meeting Request complies with this Section 2, the Board of Directors shall determine the place, date and time of a special meeting requested in such Special Meeting Request and promptly call the special meeting requested in such Special Meeting Request; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may (in lieu of calling the special meeting requested in such Special Meeting Request) present an identical or substantially similar item (a "Similar Item", and the election of directors shall be deemed a "Similar Item" with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors) for shareholder approval at any other meeting of shareholders that is held not less than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Secretary receives such Special Meeting Request.
(b) At any special meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted or considered as shall have been properly brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. To be properly brought before a special meeting, proposals of business must be (1) specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (2) otherwise properly brought before the special meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (3) otherwise properly requested to be brought before the special meeting by the Requisite Holders in accordance with these By-Laws; provided, however, that with regard to this clause (3), the Board of Directors may submit its own proposal(s) for consideration at such special meeting. For proposals of business to be properly requested by the Requisite Holders to be brought before a special meeting, each of the Requisite Holders must (i) be a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice of such special meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors and at the time of the special meeting, (ii) be entitled to vote at such special meeting and (iii) comply with the procedures set forth in these By-Laws as to such business. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may only be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (A) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (B) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Corporation who (i) is a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice of such special meeting and at the time of the special meeting, (ii) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (iii) complies with the procedures set forth in these By-Laws and the Certificate of Incorporation as to such nomination. The preceding two sentences shall be the exclusive means for shareholders to make nominations or to bring other business proposals before a special meeting of shareholders (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and included in the Corporation's notice of meeting).
 
In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more persons to the Board of Directors, any shareholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, provided that the shareholder gives timely notice thereof, which notice must comply with the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation and Article I, Section 4 hereof (including timely delivery of the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Article I, Section 4(c) of these By-Laws), and timely updates and supplements thereof, in writing, to the Secretary.
(c) Without qualification or limitation, for any business to be properly requested to be brought before a special meeting by the Requisite Holders pursuant to this Section 2, the Requisite Holders must have given timely delivery of the Special Meeting Request, which Special Meeting Request must comply with the requirements of Article I, Section 4 hereof, and timely updates and supplements thereof, in writing to the Secretary, and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action under applicable law. A Special Meeting Request must be delivered by hand, by registered U.S. mail, or by courier service to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation and shall only be valid if it is signed and dated by each of the Requisite Holders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these By-Laws, a Special Meeting Request shall not be valid if (1) the Special Meeting Request relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for shareholder action under applicable law, (2) a Similar Item was presented at any meeting of shareholders held within one hundred twenty (120) days prior to receipt by the Corporation of such Special Meeting Request, (3) a Similar Item is included in the Corporation's notice as an item of business to be brought before a shareholder meeting that has been called but not yet held, or (4) the Special Meeting Request is received by the Corporation during the period commencing ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting and ending on the date of that year's annual meeting of shareholders.
In addition, to be considered timely, a Special Meeting Request shall further be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such Special Meeting Request shall be true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation by the later of five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting or the deadline for the delivery of the Special Meeting Request, in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date, and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the meeting, any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Any notice of a nomination given pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation shall include a representation that the shareholder will properly notify the Corporation in writing of any subsequent change in the information provided or required to be provided.
The Requisite Holders may revoke a Special Meeting Request by written revocation delivered to the Corporation at any time prior to the special meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the discretion to determine whether or not to proceed with the special meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2, if none of the Requisite Holders appears or sends a Qualified Representative to present the proposal(s) submitted by the Requisite Holders for consideration at the special meeting or if the Requisite Holders giving the Special Meeting Request no longer represent at least 25% of the outstanding common stock of the Corporation or if any of the Requisite Holders fails to timely provide any information required to be provided to update a Special Meeting Request, the Corporation need not present such proposal(s) for a vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.
SECTION 3. GENERAL. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the Chairman of any annual or special meeting shall have the power to determine all matters relating to the conduct of the meeting, including, but not limited to, determining whether any nomination or any other item of business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been properly made or brought before the meeting, as the case may be, in accordance with these By-Laws, and if the chairman should so determine and declare that any nomination or other item of business has not been properly made or brought before an annual or special meeting, to declare that no action shall be taken on such nomination or other proposal, and such nomination or other proposal shall be disregarded.
 
(b) Nothing in these By-Laws shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Subject to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, nothing in these By-Laws shall be construed to permit any shareholder, or give any shareholder the right, to include or have disseminated or described in the Corporation's proxy statement any nomination of a director or directors or any other business proposal.
SECTION 4. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. (a) A shareholder's notice to the Secretary pursuant to Article I, Section 1 of these By-Laws, a Special Meeting Request pursuant to Article I, Section 2 of these By-Laws, a request to the Secretary for nomination of a director pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or a Written Consent Request pursuant to Article I, Section 11 of these By-laws, must include the following, as applicable.

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of these By-Laws, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in these By-Laws; provided, however, that any references in these By-Laws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the separate and additional requirements set forth in these By-Laws with respect to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to Article I, Sections 1, 2 or 11 of these By-Laws.
(c) To be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation, a person must deliver (in accordance with the time periods prescribed for delivery of notice, a Special Meeting Request or other request under Article I, Sections 1, 2 or 11 of these By-Laws and under the Certificate of Incorporation) to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation a written questionnaire with respect to the background

SECTION 5. NOTICE OF MEETING. Written notice of each annual or special meeting of the shareholders, specifying the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which shareholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, shall be given at least ten (10) but not more than sixty (60) days prior to such meetings to each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting; provided, however, that notice of any meeting to take action on a proposed merger or consolidation of the Corporation or on a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation shall be given at least twenty (20) but not more than sixty (60) days prior to such meeting. Notice of a special meeting of the shareholders shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Each notice of a special meeting of shareholders shall indicate that it has been issued by or at the direction of the person or persons calling the meeting.
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which shareholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
A written waiver of notice signed by the shareholder entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a shareholder at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the shareholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
SECTION 6. PLACE OF MEETING. Every annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may be determined by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of any such meeting, and every special meeting shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may be stated in the notice of such special meeting. The Board of Directors may determine that a meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communications in accordance with Section 211(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, shareholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of shareholders may, by means of remote communication (a) participate in a meeting of shareholders; and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of shareholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (1) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a shareholder or proxyholder; (2) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such shareholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (3) if any shareholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.
 
SECTION 7. QUORUM AND ADJOURNMENT. At each meeting of the shareholders there shall be present, either in person or by proxy, the holders of a majority of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote thereat in order to constitute a quorum. Any meeting of the shareholders at which a quorum is not present may be adjourned from time to time to some other time by a majority of the shareholders represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. At an adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
SECTION 8. PROCEDURE FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; REQUIRED VOTE. (a) Subject to the next succeeding sentence and except as required by all applicable laws or as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, at all meetings of the shareholders, all questions shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast at the meeting of the holders of shares entitled to vote thereon. Each director nominee shall be elected to the Board of Directors by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director nominee's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the director nominees shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the determination thereof to be made by the Secretary of the Corporation as of the close of the applicable notice of nomination period set forth in these By-Laws or under applicable law, based on whether one or more notice(s) of nomination were timely filed in accordance with these By-Laws or under applicable law (provided, however, that the determination that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected shall be determinative only as to the timeliness of a notice of nomination and not otherwise to its validity). For purposes of this Section 8, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director nominee.
If an incumbent director is not elected by a majority of votes cast (unless, pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, the director election standard is a plurality), the incumbent director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors for consideration. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the director's resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results. An incumbent director who tenders his or her resignation for consideration will not participate in the Committee's or the Board of Directors' recommendation or decision, or any deliberations related thereto.
If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 8, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Article IV, Section 3 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to Article II, Section 9. If a director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 8, such director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or his or her earlier resignation or removal.
(b) On any matter, every shareholder of record shall be entitled at every meeting of shareholders to one vote for every share of common stock standing in his or her name on the books of the Corporation and qualified to vote.
SECTION 9. PROXIES. At all meetings of the shareholders, absent shareholders entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy or by the attorney-in-fact thereof. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of three years from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the person executing it except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.
SECTION 10. LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each shareholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each shareholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided in the notice of the meeting or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In
 
the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any shareholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the examination of any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
SECTION 11. SHAREHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such shareholders, may be taken without a meeting and without a vote, if consents in writing, solicited, executed and delivered in accordance with these By-Laws, the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed and delivered to the Corporation and not revoked by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. No action by consent shall be effective unless the record holders of shares representing at least 25% of the outstanding common stock of the Corporation (the "Written Consent Requisite Holders"), prior to soliciting any written consents in respect of such action, shall have, by written notice to the Secretary, requested that the Board of Directors fix a record date (a "Written Consent Request") and have subsequently solicited consents with respect to such proposed action from all holders of outstanding common stock as of the record date for such consents. Delivery of such Written Consent Request shall be by hand, by registered U.S. mail, or by courier service to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. Such request shall set forth as to each action the Written Consent Requisite Holders propose to have the shareholders authorize or take pursuant to such written consent the information required for a shareholder's notice pursuant to Article I, Section 4 of these By-Laws and shall state whether either such Written Consent Requisite Holders or any beneficial owner on whose behalf such Written Consent Requisite Holders are acting, intends to solicit or participate in the solicitation of written consents alone or as part of a group, from the holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding shares required to approve the proposal and/or otherwise to solicit written consents from shareholders in support of the proposal.
The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a Written Consent Request complying with these By-Laws is received by the Secretary of the Corporation, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of the preceding paragraph). If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph or otherwise within ten (10) days of the date on which such a Written Consent Request complying with these By-Laws is received by the Secretary of the Corporation, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery at its principal executive offices. Delivery shall be by hand, by registered U.S. mail, or by courier service to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 11 and applicable law, to the Corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date
 
as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Section 11 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. The action by written consent will take effect as of the date and time of the certification of the written consents and will not relate back to the date the written consents were delivered to the Corporation. In conducting the review required by this paragraph, the independent inspectors may, at the expense of the Corporation, retain legal counsel and any other necessary or appropriate professional advisors and such other personnel as they may deem necessary or appropriate to assist them and shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinion of such counsel or advisors. Nothing contained in this Section 11 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
If after such review the independent inspectors shall determine that the written consent or consents are valid and that the action specified therein has been validly authorized, that fact shall forthwith be certified on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of shareholders, and the written consent or consents shall be filed in such records. Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those shareholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of shareholders to take the action were delivered to the Secretary as provided in this Section 11.
Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no action may be taken by the shareholders by written consent except in accordance with these By-Laws and the Certificate of Incorporation. If the Board of Directors shall determine that any request to fix a record date or to take shareholder action by written consent was not properly made in accordance with these By-Laws and the Certificate of Incorporation, or the shareholder or shareholders seeking to take such action do not otherwise comply with these By-Laws and the Certificate of Incorporation, then the Board of Directors shall not be required to fix a record date and any such purported action by written consent shall be null and void to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to the requirements of these By-Laws and the Certificate of Incorporation with respect to shareholders seeking to take an action by written consent, any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall comply with all requirements of applicable law, including all requirements of the Exchange Act, with respect to such action.
SECTION 1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by and under the direction of the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided by law and except as hereinafter otherwise provided for filling vacancies, each director of the Corporation shall be elected in accordance with Article I, Section 8 by the shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting of the shareholders, to hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she is elected and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.
SECTION 2. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors.
SECTION 3. Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be called at any time by the Secretary at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the President, one-third of the directors then in office, or the Lead Director in connection with a special meeting of the non-employee directors.
SECTION 4. Written notice of the time and place of each special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given to each director at least forty-eight hours before the start of the meeting, or if sent by first class mail, at least seven (7) days before the start of the meeting. A written waiver of notice signed by the director entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the director attends a meeting for the
 
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
SECTION 5. Members of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation in a meeting pursuant to this section shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
SECTION 6. A majority of the total number of directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the approval of two-thirds of the independent directors (as defined in the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines) shall be required to approve any compensation granted to the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer. Any regular or special meeting of the Board at which a quorum is not present may be adjourned from time to time to some other place or time or both by a majority of the directors present without any notice other than an announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.
SECTION 7. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors and to the extent permitted by law, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board.
SECTION 8. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.
SECTION 9. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall consist of not less than three nor more than fifteen members, the exact number of Directors to be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.
SECTION 10. Directors may receive compensation for services to the Corporation in their capacities as directors or otherwise in such manner and in such amounts as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.
SECTION 1. The Board of Directors shall appoint a Chairman of the Board, a Treasurer and a Secretary. The Board may at any time appoint a President, one or more Vice Presidents, Assistant Treasurers, Assistant Secretaries and such other officers and agents with such powers and duties as it shall deem necessary. Each such officer shall serve from the time of his or her appointment until a successor shall be chosen and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.
SECTION 2. The Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of shareholders and of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board shall be the chief executive officer and head of the Corporation and, subject to the Board of Directors, shall have the general control and management of the business and affairs of the Corporation. He or she shall vote any shares of stock or other voting securities owned by the Corporation. In general, he or she shall perform all duties incident to the office of the Chairman of the Board and such other duties as may from time to time be assigned to him or her by the Board.
 
SECTION 3. The President, if one is appointed, shall be the chief operating officer of the Corporation and, subject to the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board, shall have control of the operational aspects of the business and affairs of the Corporation. The President shall see that all orders of the Chairman of the Board are carried into effect, and shall perform all other duties necessary to his or her office or properly required of him or her by the Board or the Chairman of the Board. The President, in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, shall preside at all meetings of shareholders and of the Board of Directors. If a President is not appointed, or during the absence or disability of the President, or during a vacancy in the office of President, the Chairman of the Board shall perform the duties and have the powers of the President.
SECTION 4. Vice Presidents, if appointed, shall perform such duties and have such powers as the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the President or another more senior Vice President shall designate from time to time.
SECTION 5. The Secretary shall have custody of the seal of the Corporation. The Secretary shall keep the minutes of the Board of Directors, and of the shareholders, and shall attend to the giving and serving of all notices of the Corporation. He or she shall have charge of the certificate book and such other books and papers as the Board may direct; and he or she shall perform such other duties as may be incidental to his or her office or as may be assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors. The Secretary shall also keep or cause to be kept a stock book, containing the names, alphabetically arranged, of all persons who are shareholders of the Corporation showing their respective addresses, the number of shares registered in the name of each, and the dates when they respectively became the owners of record thereof, and such books shall be open for inspection as prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware. During the absence or disability of the Secretary, or during a vacancy in the office of Secretary, any Assistant Secretary designated by the Chairman of the Board may perform the duties and have the powers of the Secretary.
SECTION 6. The Treasurer shall have the care and custody of the funds and securities of the Corporation and shall deposit the same in the name of the Corporation in such bank or banks as the Board of Directors may determine. During the absence or disability of the Treasurer, or during a vacancy in the office of Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer designated by the Chairman of the Board may perform the duties and have the powers of the Treasurer.
SECTION 1. Any director or officer may resign his or her office at any time (or shall tender his or her resignation for consideration as provided in Article I, Section 8), such resignation to be made in writing and to take effect from the time of its receipt by the Corporation, unless some future time be fixed in the resignation and in that case from that time. Except as provided in Article I, Section 8, the acceptance of a resignation shall not be required to make it effective. Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect any contractual rights of the Corporation.
SECTION 2. Any officer may be removed with or without cause at any time by the Board of Directors. The removal of an officer without cause shall be without prejudice to his or her contractual rights, if any. The election or appointment of an officer shall not of itself create contractual rights. Any director or the entire Board may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
SECTION 3. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the Directors then in office, and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and directors so chosen shall hold office until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. If the office of any officer becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy may be filled by the Board of Directors.
 
SECTION 1. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, (a "proceeding") by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by such person. The Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
SECTION 2. Subject to any applicable laws, the Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director of the Corporation in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that the payment of such expenses shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified. Expenses incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents of the Corporation may be advanced upon such terms and conditions as the Corporation deems appropriate.
SECTION 3. If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses (including attorneys' fees) under this Article is not paid in full within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, subject to any applicable laws, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid the expense (including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. In any such action, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.
SECTION 4. The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not contravene the provisions of any applicable laws and such rights shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
SECTION 5. The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.
SECTION 6. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
SECTION 7. The rights provided by or granted pursuant to this Article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. Subject to any applicable laws, all rights provided by or granted pursuant to this Article shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Article shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification of such directors, officers, employees or agents, or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder.
 
SECTION 1. The Corporation is authorized to issue shares of common stock of the Corporation in certificated or uncertificated form. The shares of the common stock of the Corporation shall be registered on the books of the Corporation in the order in which they shall be issued. Any certificates for shares of the common stock, and any other shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented by certificates, shall be numbered, shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board, the President or a Vice President, and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer and sealed with the seal of the Corporation. Any or all of the signatures on a certificate may be a facsimile signature. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the Corporation shall send, or caused to be sent, to the record owner thereof a written statement of the information required by law to be on certificates.
SECTION 2. Transfers of shares shall be made upon the books of the Corporation (a) only by the holder of record thereof, or by a duly authorized agent, transferee or legal representative and (b) in the case of certificated shares, upon the surrender to the Corporation of the certificate or certificates for such shares.
SECTION 3. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation and alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming that the certificate of stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issuance of a new certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or such owner's legal representative, to indemnify the Corporation in such manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond, in such form and amount as the Board of Directors may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate or certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
SECTION 4. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share on the part of any other person whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise may be provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
The Chairman of the Board or the President or any officers designated by resolution of the Board of Directors shall sign all checks and drafts necessary to be drawn and may accept any drafts drawn upon the Corporation in due course of business. No check or draft shall be endorsed by the Corporation and no promissory note, bond, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness shall be made, signed, issued or endorsed by the Corporation unless signed by the Chairman or the President or any officer designated under powers given by a resolution of the Board except that any officer may endorse for collection or deposit only, expressly stating the purpose of such endorsements, checks, drafts and promissory notes to the order of the Corporation.
The seal of the Corporation shall be in the custody of the Secretary. It shall be circular in form and shall have engraved upon it the name of the Corporation arranged in a circle and the words and figures "Incorporated 1978 Delaware" across the center of the space enclosed.
 
The Corporation shall not be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (Business Combination with Interested Stockholders). This Article IX shall be amended only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Corporation's shareholders entitled to vote on such matter.
SECTION 1. Whenever, under any provisions of these By-Laws, notice is required to be given to any shareholder, the same shall be given in writing, either (a) by personal delivery or by mailing such notice to the shareholder's last known post office address as the same shall appear on the record of shareholders of the Corporation or its transfer agent or, if the shareholder shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to him or her be mailed to him or her at some other address, then addressed to the shareholder at such other address, or (b) by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the shareholder to whom the notice is given, except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the shareholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
SECTION 2. Any notice required to be given to any director may be given by the methods stated in Article X, Section 1 above. Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as such director shall have filed in writing with the Secretary of the Corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post office address of such director. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.
SECTION 3. All notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given when deposited, postage prepaid, in a United States post office or official depository. All notices given to shareholders by a form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given: (a) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the shareholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (1) such posting and (2) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the shareholder. All notices given to directors by form of electronic transmission, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given when directed to the electronic mail address, facsimile number, or other location filed in writing by the director with the Secretary of the Corporation.
SECTION 4. Whenever notice is to be given to the Corporation by a shareholder under any provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Corporation, such notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. If delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the shareholder's notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the Corporation's most recent proxy statement.
When used in these By-Laws, the terms "written" and "in writing" shall include any "electronic transmission," as defined in Section 232(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, including without limitation any telegram, cablegram, facsimile transmission and communication by electronic mail.
 
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation by the affirmative action of a majority of its members. The By-Laws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the affirmative vote a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at any regular meeting of the shareholders or at any special meeting of the shareholders if notice of such proposed adoption, amendment or repeal be contained in the notice of such meeting.
