EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99(1)
Thank you Jay, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I would like to make a few brief comments on some key operating highlights and provide some guidance on production and capital expenditures for next year. I'll then ask John Rielly to review the 3rd quarter financials before we open it up for questions.
We continue to make progress in reshaping our portfolio. In terms of asset swaps, during the third quarter we completed the exchange of our 25% stake in Premier Oil for a 23% stake in Natuna Sea, Block A, in Indonesia. In addition, on October 1, we closed our previously announced transaction with Encana, in which we swapped a 14% stake in the Scott and Telford Fields in the UK sector of the North Sea, in exchange for an additional 22.5% interest in the Llano Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, bringing our working interest to 50%.
 
The development of the Llano field is progressing as planned and we expect the field to commence production in the middle of next year with production forecast to average 16 mboe/d, net, in 2005.
Our appraisal work on Northern Block G in Equatorial Guinea continues. We have drilled two wells of the previously announced six well program so far. We plan to drill the remaining four wells over the next several months. We are going to wait until we have all of the drilling results before formulating our final development plan. We are still targeting submission of a Plan of Development to the government of Equatorial Guinea early next year.
On the exploration front, we are happy to announce that the Tubular Bells prospect, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, was a discovery. The prospect is located on Mississippi Canyon Block 725 and we have a 20% working interest. The well was drilled in 4,300 feet of water and encountered 190 feet of net oil pay. Further appraisal drilling is planned to determine the extent of the discovery.
 
However, the G-13-3 well, in Equatorial Guinea, was a dry hole. We intend to further evaluate this area where we had previously announced two discoveries. However, we are expensing both the G-13-2 well and the G-13-3 well.
The Shenzi appraisal well, on Green Canyon Block 653, was spudded on September 22. We have a 28% working interest in this prospect. The well is drilling ahead and we expect to be in a position to announce results before the end of the year.
Our Refining and Marketing operations posted strong financial results in the quarter. The HOVENSA refinery benefited from strong margins, particularly in August when the U.S. experienced supply problems, while retail marketing margins strengthened in September.
I now want to make a few comments regarding our forecast for production and capital expenditures. Our best estimate for 2003 production is 369 mboe/d, which breaks down as 259 mb/d of liquids and 660 mmcf/d of natural gas. For 2004, we are estimating full year production of about 325 mboe/d, with the breakdown being 237 mb/d of
 
liquids and 530 mmcf/d of natural gas. About 40% of the expected decline in 2004 is related to asset sales and swaps, with the balance related to natural field declines, partially offset by the start up of the Llano field in the middle of next year.
While we do not make formal production forecasts beyond one year, the changes we have made to our portfolio combined with our current slate of development projects, give us confidence that our production will enter a meaningful growth phase beginning in mid-2005.
We expect capital expenditures for 2003 to come in at $1.4 billion, and we currently forecast 2004 spending to be in the range of $1.5 billion. Over 90% of both years' capital expenditures are devoted to exploration and production activities. In addition, about 60% of both years' E&P budgets are earmarked for development projects.
We are implementing significant change to our upstream business. We are transitioning out of mature areas, and are shifting focus to longer-lived and more profitable assets. While this change takes time, we
 
believe that we are positioning Amerada Hess for much improved long-term operating and financial performance.
Now let me ask John Rielly to review the quarterly results.
Cautionary Note:
The foregoing prepared remarks include certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and gas companies, in their documents filed with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. Certain references are made in the foregoing prepared remarks to reserves other than proved reserves. SEC guidelines strictly prohibit registrants from including such references in documents filed with the SEC.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          New York, New York....October 29, 2003...Amerada Hess Corporation (NYSE: AHC) reported net income of $146 million for the third quarter of 2003 compared with a net loss of $136 million for the third quarter of 2002. Results for the third quarter of 2002 included an after-tax impairment charge of $207 million ($318 million before income taxes). Net income was $574 million in the first nine months of 2003 compared with $153 million in the corresponding period of 2002. The after-tax results by major operating activity for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
                  (a) Reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
          The Corporation's oil and gas production, on a barrel-of-oil equivalent basis, was 339,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2003 compared to 441,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2002. Approximately one-half of the decline in production resulted from asset sales in connection with the Corporation's initiatives to reshape its portfolio of producing properties. In the third quarter of 2003, the Corporation's average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $24.65 per barrel, a decrease of $1.44 per barrel from the third quarter of 2002. The Corporation's average United States natural gas selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $3.53 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2003, an increase of $.06 per Mcf from the third quarter of 2002.
          Refining and marketing earnings increased in the third quarter of 2003 compared with the third quarter of 2002 reflecting higher refining margins and increased earnings from retail gasoline station operations. Refining and marketing earnings in the third quarter of 2002 included an after-tax gain of $67 million ($102 million before income taxes) from the sale of six United States flag tankers.
 
          Corporate expenses in the first nine months of 2003 include $15 million of after-tax expense ($27 million before income taxes) from early repayment of debt. The amount in the corresponding period of 2002 was $4 million ($10 million before income taxes).
          The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in net income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2003 and 2002 (in millions):
          The third quarter 2003 income tax benefit of $30 million reflects the recognition for United States income tax purposes of certain prior year foreign exploration expenses.
          Sales and other operating revenues in the third quarter of 2003 amounted to $3,230 million compared with $2,724 million in the third quarter of 2002. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2003 amounted to $307 million of which $298 million related to exploration and production activities. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2002 amounted to $345 million, including $323 million for exploration and production.

          In the preceding discussion, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Such after-tax amounts may be considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that they are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.
          The following table contains the pre-tax amounts of items included in net income which are shown on an after-tax basis above (in millions):
