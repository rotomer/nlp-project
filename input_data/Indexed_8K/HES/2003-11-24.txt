The Securities will be established by the Certificate of Designations identified in Schedule I hereto (the "Certificate of Designations"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representative", as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms. The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration statement (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) on Form S-3, relating to certain debt securities, convertible debt securities, warrants, preferred stock, convertible preferred stock and Stock (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company.

The registration statement as amended to the date of this Agreement is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement" and the related prospectus covering the
Shelf Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus". The Basic Prospectus as supplemented by the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus". If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary form of Prospectus (a "preliminary prospectus") previously filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") on or before the date of this Agreement or the date of the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the date of the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.

In addition, the Company hereby grants to the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election up to 1,500,000 Optional Securities, at the purchase price per share set forth in the paragraph above, for the sole purpose of covering sales of shares in excess of the number of Firm Securities, provided that the purchase price per Optional Security shall be reduced by an amount per share equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the Company and payable on the Firm Securities but not payable on the Optional Securities. Any such election to purchase Optional Securities may be exercised only by written notice from you to the Company, given within a period of 30 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Securities to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Securities are to be delivered, as 2
determined by you but in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 3 hereof) or, unless you and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than two or later than ten Business Days (as defined in Section 3 hereof) after the date of such notice. 2. The Company understands that the several Underwriters intend (i) to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Securities and (ii) initially to offer the Securities upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus. 3.

Such time and date for payment and delivery of the Firm Securities is herein called the "First Time of Delivery", such time and date for payment and delivery of the Optional Securities, if not the First Time of Delivery, is herein called the "Second Time of Delivery", and each such time and date for payment and delivery with respect to the Securities is referred to herein as a "Closing Date". As used herein, the term "Business Day" means any day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to be closed in New York City. Payment for the Securities shall be made against delivery by the Company to the nominee of The Depository Trust Company for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Securities in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as Goldman, Sachs & Co. may request upon notice to the Company, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the transfer to the Underwriters of the Securities duly paid by the Company. 4.

described in the Prospectus and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, other than where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and all of the issued shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and (except in the case of foreign subsidiaries, for directors' qualifying shares) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims; (iii) other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending against or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be a party or to which any property of the Company or its subsidiaries is or may be the subject which could individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the general affairs, business, prospects, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others; and such counsel does not know of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which are not filed or described as required; (iv) neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is, or with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would be, in violation of or in default under, its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (or similar constitutive documents) or any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them or any of their respective properties is bound, except for violations and defaults which individually and in the aggregate are not material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; the issue and sale of the Securities 15
and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Securities and this Agreement, the issue of Stock upon conversion of the Securities and the consummation by it of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not (A) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries is subject, except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults as would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (B) result in any violation of (x) the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company or (y) any applicable law or statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties except, in the case of this clause (y), for violations that would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (v) the statements in the Prospectus incorporated by reference from Item 3 of Part 1 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and as such statements have been amended or supplemented by the Company's subsequent reports filed on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present in all material respects the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents or proceedings; and (vi) such counsel is of the opinion that each document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) complied as to form when filed with the Commission in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. In rendering such opinions, White & Case LLP and Mr. Collins may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of the United States and the States of New York and Delaware, to the extent such counsel deem proper and to the extent specified in such opinion, if at all, upon an opinion or opinions (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to 16
Underwriters' counsel) of other counsel reasonably acceptable to the Underwriters' counsel, familiar with the applicable laws; (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent such counsel deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and certificates or other written statements of officials of jurisdictions having custody of documents respecting the corporate existence or good standing of the Company. The opinion of each such counsel shall state that the opinion of any such other counsel upon which they relied is in form satisfactory to such counsel and, in such counsel's opinion, the Underwriters and they are justified in relying thereon. With respect to the matters to be covered in subparagraph (ix) of paragraph (f) above White & Case LLP may state their opinion and belief is based upon their participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein) and review and discussion of the contents thereof (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) but is without independent check or verification except as specified. The opinions of White & Case LLP and Mr. Collins described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein. (h) on the date hereof and on the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to you letters, dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to you, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; (i) you shall have received on and as of the Closing Date an opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to the Underwriters, with respect to the validity of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (j) on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representative such further certificates and documents as the Representative shall reasonably request; and (k) the Company shall have obtained and delivered to the Underwriters executed copies of an agreement from John B. Hess, John J. O'Connor, J. Barclay Collins, F. Borden Walker, and John Y. Schreyer, substantially to the effect set forth in Subsection 5(i) hereof in form and substance satisfactory to you. 17
7. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including without limitation the reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto and as used during the period specified in Section 5(d) hereof) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein and except that with respect to any preliminary prospectus, such indemnity shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or the benefit of any person controlling such Underwriter) if the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Securities that are the subject thereof from such Underwriter and if such person was not sent or given a copy of the Prospectus at or prior to confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person in any case where such sending or giving is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing, and the Indemnifying Person, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnifying Person may designate in 18
such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons of Underwriters shall be designated in writing by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and such control persons of the Company or authorized representatives shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request and (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 7 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such 19
Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and the commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto, and not joint. 20
The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any other person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities. 8. Notwithstanding anything herein contained, this Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the respective Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial or economic conditions in or affecting the United States, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and which, in the judgment of the Representative, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. 9. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase under this Agreement, and the aggregate number of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate number of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representative may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the number of Securities that any Underwriter 21
has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate number of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. 10. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any condition of the Underwriters' obligations cannot be fulfilled, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering of Securities. 11. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, the Underwriters, any controlling persons referred to herein and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase. 12. Any action by the Underwriters hereunder may be taken by the Representative alone on behalf of the Underwriters, and any such action taken by the Representative shall be binding upon the Underwriters. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be given at the address set forth in Schedule I hereto. Notices to the Company shall be given to it at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 22
13. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 23
14. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION, PREFERENCES AND RELATIVE, OPTIONAL AND OTHER SPECIAL RIGHTS AND QUALIFICATIONS, LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS THEREOF OF 7.00% MANDATORY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF AMERADA HESS CORPORATION Pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware Amerada Hess Corporation, (the "Corporation"), a corporation organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), does hereby certify that, pursuant to the provisions of Section 151 of the DGCL, the Corporation's Board of Directors has adopted the following resolution, which resolution remains in full force and effect as of the date hereof: WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") is authorized within the limitations and restrictions stated in the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), to fix by resolution or resolutions the designation of each series of Preferred Stock of the Company (the "Preferred Stock") and the powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such provisions as may be desired concerning voting, redemption, dividends, dissolution or the distribution of assets, conversion or exchange, and such other subjects or matters as may be fixed by resolution or resolutions of the Board under the DGCL; and WHEREAS, it is the desire of the Board, pursuant to its authority as aforesaid, to designate and fix the powers, preferences and relative, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of a series of the Preferred Stock and the number of shares constituting such series. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that there is hereby authorized and designated such a series of the Preferred Stock and that the Board hereby fixes the designations, powers, preferences and relative, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof as herein set forth:
(1) Designation and Amount. The shares of this series of Preferred Stock shall be designated as "7.00% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock" (the "Convertible Preferred Stock") and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 13,500,000, with a par value of $1.00 per share. (2) Ranking. The Convertible Preferred Stock shall rank, as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, (a) senior to the Common Stock, (b) senior to any class or series of capital stock issued by the Corporation which by its terms ranks junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock, (c) junior to any class or series of capital stock issued by the Corporation which by its terms ranks senior to the Convertible Preferred Stock, and (d) pari passu with any other class or series of capital stock issued by the Corporation. (3) Dividends. (a) Dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly when declared out of legally available funds, on each Dividend Payment Date, at the annual rate of $3.50 per share. The initial dividend on the Convertible Preferred Stock for the first Dividend Period, commencing on the date of first issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock (assuming a date of first issuance of November 25, 2003), to but excluding March 1, 2004, will be $0.9333 per share, and when declared out of legally available funds, will be payable on March 1, 2004. Each subsequent quarterly dividend on the Convertible Preferred Stock will be $0.8750 per share. Dividends payable on a Dividend Payment Date will be payable to Record Holders for the applicable Dividend Payment Date. (b) The amount of dividends payable on each share of Convertible Preferred Stock for each full quarterly period will be computed by dividing the annual dividend by four. The amount of dividends payable for any other period that is shorter or longer than a full quarterly dividend period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Declared but unpaid dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock shall cumulate from the Dividend Payment Date on which they become payable, but no interest shall accrue on accumulated but unpaid dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock. (4) Payment Restrictions. (a) Unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock for all prior Dividend Periods have been paid, the Corporation may not: (i) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution of assets on any of the Corporation's capital stock that ranks junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, other than dividends or distributions in the form of the Corporation's capital stock that ranks junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation; -2-
(ii) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any of the Corporation's capital stock that ranks junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, except upon conversion or exchange for the Corporation's capital stock that ranks junior to the Corporation's Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation; or (iii) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any Parity Stock, except for conversion or exchange for the Corporation's capital stock that ranks junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation. (5) Voting Rights. (a) Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or set forth herein, Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are not entitled to any voting rights and their consent shall not be required for the taking of any corporate action. (b) So long as any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation will not, without the approval of the Holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, given in person or by proxy either at a regular meeting or at a special meeting called for that purpose, at which the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote separately as a series, amend, alter or repeal (by merger, consolidation, combination, reclassification or otherwise) any of the provisions of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and restated, so as to affect adversely the powers, preferences, privileges, voting power or rights of the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock; provided that any such amendment that (i) adversely changes the dividend payable on the Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) adversely changes the Liquidation Preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock or (iii) adversely affects the conversion provisions of the Convertible Preferred Stock, requires the affirmative approval of each Holder of Convertible Preferred Stock affected; provided, further, that the amendment of the provisions of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation so as to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of any shares ranking junior or pari passu as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation to the Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to affect adversely the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. (c) If at any time dividends on any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or any other class or series of Parity Stock having like voting rights shall be in arrears for Dividend Periods, that in the aggregate are equivalent to six calendar quarters, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors constituting the Board shall be increased by two and the holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled, by written notice to the Corporation given by the holders of a majority in liquidation preference of such shares or by ordinary resolution passed by the holders of a majority in liquidation preference of such shares present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of such holders convened for this purpose, to appoint at the next annual meeting of the stockholders of -3-
the Corporation or at a special meeting called for such purpose, whichever is earlier, two of the authorized number of the Corporation's directors (each, a "Preferred Stock Director") at the next annual meeting of stockholders and each subsequent meeting until all dividends accumulated on the Convertible Preferred Stock have been fully paid or set aside for payment, to remove any such member from office and to appoint another person in place of such Preferred Stock Director. The term of office of such Preferred Stock Directors will terminate immediately upon the termination of the right of the holders of Convertible Preferred Stock to vote for directors. Not later than 30 days after such entitlement arises, if written notice by a majority of the holders of such shares has not been given as provided for in the preceding sentence, the Board will convene a separate general meeting for the above purpose. If the Board or such authorized committee fails to convene such meeting within such 30-day period, the holders of 10% of the outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, considered as a single class, will be entitled to convene such meeting. The provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Corporation relating to the convening and conduct of general meetings of stockholders will apply with respect to any such separate general meeting. Any member of the Board so appointed shall vacate office and the number of directors constituting the Board shall decrease by two if, following the event which gave rise to such appointment, the Corporation shall have resumed the payment of accumulated dividends in full on the Convertible Preferred Stock and each series of Parity Stock having similar voting rights. (d) So long as any of the Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Corporation will not, without the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding and any class or series of Parity Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy either at a regular meeting or at a special meeting called for that purpose: (i) issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any stock of any class ranking senior to the Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends or distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation; (ii) reclassify any of the Corporation's authorized stock into any stock of any class, or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase such stock, ranking senior to the Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends or distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation; provided, that the Corporation may issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any stock ranking junior to or pari passu with the Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends or distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation without the vote of any Holder of the Convertible Preferred Stock; or (iii) voluntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind up the Corporation's affairs, or sell, lease or convey (other than by mortgage) all or substantially all of the Corporation's property or business, or consolidate or merge the Corporation with or into any other corporation, except any such consolidation or merger wherein none of the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of any series of the Corporation's preferred -4-
stock, including the Convertible Preferred Stock, or the holders thereof are adversely affected. (e) In exercising the voting rights set forth in this Section 5, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have one vote per share. (6) Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock at the time outstanding will be entitled to receive, out of the net assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders (subject to the rights of the holders of any stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or pari passu with the Convertible Preferred Stock in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and before any amount shall be paid or distributed with respect to holders of any stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation), a liquidating distribution in the amount of $50.00 per share, plus an amount equal to the sum of all accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not declared, for the then-current Dividend Period and all prior Dividend Periods. After the payment to the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock of the full amounts provided in this Section 6(a), the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining assets. (b) For the purpose of this Section 6, none of the following shall be deemed a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation: (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property or business; (ii) the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other corporation; or (iii) the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Corporation. (c) If, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the amounts payable with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding are not paid in full as provided in Section 6(a) hereof, no distribution shall be made on account of any Parity Stock unless a pro rata distribution is made on the Convertible Preferred Stock. The Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding and the holders of any Parity Stock then outstanding shall share ratably in any distribution of assets upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The amount allocable to each series of Parity Stock then outstanding will be based on the proportion of their full respective liquidation preference to the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of each such series. (d) Written notice of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable to holders of Convertible Preferred Stock in such circumstances shall be -5-
payable, shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than twenty calendar days prior to any payment date stated therein, to the Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock, at the address shown on the books of the Corporation or the Transfer Agent; provided, however, that a failure to give notice as provided above or any defect therein shall not affect the Corporation's ability to consummate a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. (7) Mandatory Conversion on the Mandatory Conversion Date. (a) Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert (unless previously converted at the option of the Holder in accordance with Section 8 hereof, converted at the option of the Corporation pursuant to Section 10 hereof or pursuant to an exercise of a Merger Early Conversion right pursuant to Section 10 hereof) on the Mandatory Conversion Date, into a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate. (b) The "Conversion Rate" shall be as follows: (i) if the Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock is equal to or greater than $60.20 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), the Conversion Rate shall be equal to 0.8305 shares of Common Stock per share of Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Minimum Conversion Rate"); (ii) if the Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but greater than $48.55 (the "Initial Price"), the Conversion Rate shall be equal to $50.00 divided by the Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock; (iii) if the Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock is less than or equal to the Initial Price, the Conversion Rate shall be equal to 1.0299 shares of Common Stock per share of Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Maximum Conversion Rate"); and (iv) the Minimum Conversion Rate, the Maximum Conversion Rate, the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price are each subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 14 hereof. (c) The Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock on the Mandatory Conversion Date shall have the right to receive the dividend payment due on such date (including any accrued and unpaid dividends for prior Dividend Periods), whether or not declared prior to such date, provided that at such time the Corporation has legally available assets. (8) Early Conversion at the Option of the Holder. (a) Shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible, in whole or in part at the option of the Holder thereof ("Early Conversion") at any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, into shares of Common Stock at the Minimum Conversion Rate, subject to adjustments as set forth in Section 14 hereof. -6-
(b) Any written notice of conversion pursuant to Section 8 hereof shall be duly executed by the Holder, and specify: (i) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted; (ii) the name(s) in which such Holder desires the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion to be registered and whether such shares of Common Stock are to be issued in book-entry or certificated form (subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements if any of such certificates are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder); (iii) if certificates are to be issued, the address to which such Holder wishes delivery to be made of such new certificates to be issued upon such conversion; and (iv) any other transfer forms, tax forms or other relevant documentation required and specified by the Transfer Agent, if necessary, to effect the conversion. (c) If specified by the Holder in the notice of conversion that shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be issued to a person other than the Holder surrendering the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, the Holder shall pay or cause to be paid any transfer or similar taxes payable in connection with the shares of Common Stock so issued. (d) Upon receipt by the Transfer Agent of a completed and duly executed notice of conversion as set forth in Section 8(b) and upon surrender of a certificate representing share(s) of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted (if held in certificated form), the Corporation shall, within three Business Days or as soon as possible thereafter, issue and shall instruct the Transfer Agent to register the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled upon conversion in the name(s) specified by such Holder in the notice of conversion. If a Holder elects to hold its shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in certificated form, the Corporation shall promptly send or cause to be sent, by hand delivery (with receipt to be acknowledged) or by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holder thereof, at the address designated by such Holder in the written notice of conversion, a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled upon conversion. In the event that there shall have been surrendered a certificate or certificates representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, only part of which are to be converted, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such Holder or such Holder's designee in the manner provided in the immediately preceding sentence a new certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock that shall not have been converted. (e) The issuance by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be effective immediately prior to the close of business on the day of receipt by the Transfer Agent of the notice of conversion and other documents, if any, set forth in Section 8(b) hereof, compliance with Section 8(c), if applicable, and the surrender by such Holder or such Holder's designee of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be -7-
converted (if held in certificated form), duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto). (9) Provisional Conversion. (a) Prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, the Corporation may, at its option, cause the conversion of all, but not less than all, the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding into shares of Common Stock at the Minimum Conversion Rate for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 14 below; provided, however, that the Closing Price of the Common Stock has exceeded 150% of the Threshold Appreciation Price for at least 20 Trading Days within a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day prior to the date (the "Provisional Conversion Notice Date") on which the Corporation notifies the Holders (pursuant to clause (b) below) that it is exercising its option to cause the conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 9. The Corporation shall be able to cause this conversion only if, in addition to issuing the Holders shares of Common Stock, the Corporation pays the Holders in cash (i) an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, whether or not declared, and (ii) the present value of all remaining dividend payments on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, through and including the Mandatory Conversion Date, in each case, out of legally available assets of the Corporation. The present value of the remaining dividend payments will be computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield. (b) A written notice (the "Provisional Conversion Notice") shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of record as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the Provisional Conversion Notice Date (i) notifying such Holders of the election of the Corporation to convert and of the Provisional Conversion Date (as defined below), which date shall not be less than 30 days nor be more than 60 days after the Provisional Conversion Notice Date, and (ii) stating the Corporate Trust Office of the Transfer Agent at which the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for conversion shall, upon presentation and surrender of the certificate(s) (if such shares are held in certificated form) evidencing such shares, be converted, and the Minimum Conversion Rate to be applied thereto. The Corporation shall also issue a press release containing such information and publish such information on its website on the World Wide Web, provided that failure to issue such press release or publish such information on the corporation's website shall not act to prevent or delay conversion pursuant to this Section 9. (c) The Corporation shall deliver to the Transfer Agent irrevocable written instructions authorizing the Transfer Agent, on behalf and at the expense of the Corporation, to cause the Provisional Conversion Notice to be duly mailed as soon as practicable after receipt of such irrevocable instructions from the Corporation and in accordance with the above provisions. The shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 9 and all funds necessary for the payment in cash of (1) any accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, whether or not declared, and (2) the present value of all remaining dividend payments on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding through and including the Mandatory Conversion Date, shall be deposited with the Transfer Agent in trust at least one Business Day prior to the -8-
Provisional Conversion Date, for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of record as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation, so as to be and continue to be available therefor. Neither failure to mail such Provisional Conversion Notice to one or more such Holders nor any defect in such Provisional Conversion Notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for conversion as to other Holders. (d) If a Provisional Conversion Notice shall have been given as hereinbefore provided, then each Holder shall be entitled to all preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights accorded by this certificate until and including the Provisional Conversion Date. From and after the Provisional Conversion Date, upon delivery by the Corporation of the Common Stock and payment of the funds to the Transfer Agent as described in paragraph (c) above, the Convertible Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of such Holders shall cease and terminate, except the right of the Holders, upon surrender of certificates therefor, to receive Common Stock and any amounts to be paid hereunder. (e) The deposit of monies in trust with the Transfer Agent up to the amount necessary for the Provisional Conversion shall be irrevocable except that the Corporation shall be entitled to receive from the Transfer Agent the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any monies so deposited in trust, and the Holders of the shares converted shall have no claim to such interest or other earnings, and any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the Holders entitled thereto at the expiration of two years from the Provisional Conversion Date shall be repaid, together with any interest or other earnings thereon, to the Corporation, and after any such repayment, the Holders of the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation for such payment without interest. (10) Early Conversion Upon Cash Merger. (a) In the event of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation of the type described in Section 14(e) in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation is exchanged for consideration consisting of at least 30% cash or cash equivalents (any such event, a "Cash Merger"), then the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert their shares of Convertible Preferred Stock prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date (such right of the Holders to convert their shares pursuant to this Section 10(a) being the "Merger Early Conversion") as provided herein. (b) On or before the fifth Business Day after the consummation of a Cash Merger, the Corporation or, at the request and expense of the Corporation, the Transfer Agent, shall give all Holders notice of the occurrence of the Cash Merger and of the Merger Early Conversion right arising as a result thereof. The Corporation shall also deliver a copy of such notice to the Transfer Agent. Each such notice shall contain: (i) the date, which shall be not less than 20 nor more than 35 calendar days after the date of such notice, on which the Merger Early Conversion will be effected (such date being the "Merger Early Conversion Date"); -9-
(ii) the date, which shall be on the Merger Early Conversion Date, by which the Merger Early Conversion right must be exercised; (iii) the Conversion Rate in effect on the Trading Day immediately preceding such Cash Merger (calculated as if the Trading Day immediately preceding such Cash Merger were the Mandatory Conversion Date) and the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable per share of Convertible Preferred Stock by the Holder upon conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 9(d); and (iv) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise the Merger Early Conversion right. (c) To exercise a Merger Early Conversion right, a Holder shall deliver to the Transfer Agent at its Corporate Trust Office by 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the date by which the Merger Conversion Right must be exercised as specified in the notice, the certificate(s) (if such shares are held in certificated form) evidencing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to which the Merger Early Conversion right is being exercised, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation, or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto, or in blank, with a written notice to the Corporation stating the Holder's intention to convert early in connection with the Cash Merger containing the information set forth in Section 8(b) and providing the Corporation with payment instructions. (d) If the Holder exercises its Merger Early Conversion right pursuant to the terms hereof, on the Merger Early Conversion Date the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered the net cash, securities and other property entitled to be received by such exercising Holder, determined by assuming the Holder had converted its shares of Convertible Preferred Stock immediately before the Cash Merger at the Conversion Rate calculated in accordance with Section 7(b) hereof. In the event a Merger Early Conversion right is exercised by a Holder in accordance with the terms hereof, all references herein to Mandatory Conversion Date shall be deemed to refer to such Merger Early Conversion Date. (e) Upon a Merger Early Conversion, the Transfer Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in the written notice provided to the Corporation as set forth above, deliver to the Holder such net cash, securities or other property issuable upon such Merger Early Conversion, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided herein. (f) In the event that a Merger Early Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Convertible Preferred Stock representing less than all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by a Holder, upon such Merger Early Conversion the Corporation (or the successor to the Corporation, as the case may be) shall execute and the Transfer Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, authenticate, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation, a certificate evidencing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock as to which Merger Early Conversion was not effected. -10-
(11) Conversion Procedures. (a) Dividends on any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock converted to Common Stock shall cease to accrue, and such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, upon such conversion on the Mandatory Conversion Date, the Provisional Conversion Date, the Merger Early Conversion Date or any Early Conversion Date (collectively, a "Conversion Date"). (b) The person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on the Mandatory Conversion Date, the Merger Early Conversion Date, the Provisional Conversion Date or any Early Conversion Date, as the case may be. No allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 14, shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record as of any date prior to such effective date. Prior to such effective date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock) by virtue of holding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. (c) Shares of Convertible Preferred Stock duly converted in accordance with this Certificate of Designation, or otherwise reacquired by the Corporation, will resume the status of authorized and unissued Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance. (d) In the event that a holder of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such shares should be registered or the address to which the certificate or certificates representing such shares should be sent, the Corporation shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder of such Convertible Preferred Stock as shown on the records of the Corporation and to send the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the address of such holder shown on the records of the Corporation. (12) Reservation of Common Stock. (a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock reacquired and held in the treasury of the Corporation (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such treasury shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances. -11-
(c) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances. (d) The Corporation shall prepare and shall use its best efforts to obtain and keep in force such governmental or regulatory permits or other authorizations as may be required by law, and shall comply with all applicable requirements as to registration or qualification of the Common Stock (and all requirements to list the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock that are at the time applicable), in order to enable the Corporation lawfully to issue and deliver to each holder of record of Convertible Preferred Stock such number of shares of its Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding and convertible into shares of Common Stock. (e) The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Corporation will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock; provided, however, that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time. (13) Fractional Shares. (a) No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued as a result of any conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. (b) In lieu of any fractional share otherwise issuable in respect of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 7 hereof, any conversion at the option of the Corporation pursuant to Section 9 hereof or a conversion at the option of the holder pursuant to Section 8 or Section 10 hereof, the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of: (i) in the case of an mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 7 or Section 9 hereof or a Merger Early Conversion pursuant to Section 10, the Current Market Price; or (ii) in the case of an Early Conversion pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Closing Price of the Common Stock determined as of the Trading Day immediately preceding the effective date of conversion. (14) Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates. (a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon any conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Sections 8 or 9 hereof, shall be subject to the following adjustments. -12-
(i) Stock Dividends and Distributions. In case the Corporation shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be increased by dividing such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of Shares of Common Stock outstanding and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this sub-section (i), the number of shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Corporation. (ii) Subdivisions, Splits and Combinations of the Common Stock. In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective. (iii) Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights. In case the Corporation shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock (other than rights or warrants issued pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan or other similar plans), entitling such holders, for a period of up to 45 days, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this clause (iii), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not -13-
include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Corporation shall not issue any such rights or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Corporation. (iv) Debt or Asset Distribution. (A) In case the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets (excluding any dividend or distribution referred to in Section 14(a)(i) or Section 14(a)(ii) hereof, any rights or warrants referred to in Section 14(a)(iii) hereof, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend of shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in Section 14(a)(iv)(B) below), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the rate determined by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock less the then Fair Market Value of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this clause (iv)(A) is applicable, clause (iv)(B) of this Section 14(a) shall not be applicable. (B) In the case of a Spin-Off, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive that distribution will be increased by multiplying each Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock plus the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of Capital Stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock. Any adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this clause (iv)(B) of this Section 14(a) will occur on the 15th Trading Day from, but excluding, the "ex-date" with respect to the Spin-Off. (v) Cash Distributions. In case the Corporation shall distribute cash to all holders of the Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock and the denominator of which will be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock minus the amount per share of such dividend or distribution (as determined below); provided, that no adjustment will be made to either Fixed Conversion Rate for (i) any dividend or distribution in connection with the -14-
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or (ii) any quarterly cash dividend on the Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock in any fiscal quarter does not exceed $0.30 (the "Dividend Threshold Amount"). The dividend threshold amount is subject to an inversely proportional adjustment whenever the Fixed Conversion Rates are adjusted, provided that no adjustment will be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustment made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this clause (v). If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause (v) as a result of a distribution that is a quarterly dividend, the adjustment shall be based upon the amount by which the distribution exceeds the Dividend Threshold Amount. If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause as a result of a distribution that is not a quarterly dividend, the adjustment shall be based upon the full amount of such distribution. (vi) Self Tender Offers and Exchange Offers. In case a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders (based on the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares (as defined below in this Section)) of an aggregate consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value that exceeds the Closing Price per share of the Common Stock as of the Trading Day next succeeding the last time (the "Expiration Time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the second Trading Day after the date of the Expiration Time, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the first Trading Day after the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Closing Price per share of the Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time less (y) the amount of cash plus the Fair Market Value of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders in the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares), and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Closing Price per share of the Common Stock as of the first Trading Day after the Expiration Time and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares"). (vii) Third Party Tender Offers and Exchange Offers. In case any Person other than the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer in which, as of the last time (the "Offer Expiration Time") that tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it shall have been amended), the Board of Directors is not recommending rejection of the offer, then each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of -15-
business on the date of the Offer Expiration Time will be adjusted by multiplying such fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction (A) the numerator of which will be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value of the aggregate consideration payable to all holders of Common Stock based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchange and not withdrawn as of the Offer Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Accepted Purchased Shares") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding less any such Accepted Purchased Shares and the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Time and (B) the denominator of which will be the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, including any such Accepted Purchased Shares, and the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Time. Such adjustment shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day following the Offer Expiration Time. The adjustment referred to in this clause (vii) will only be made if (1) the tender offer or exchange offer is for an amount that increases the offeror's ownership of common stock to more than 25% of the total shares of Common Stock outstanding; and (2) the cash and Fair Market Value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Time. However, the adjustment referred to in this clause will not be made if as of the Offer Expiration Time, the offering documents disclose a plan or an intention to cause the corporation to engage in a consolidation or merger or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In the event the offeror is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but such Person is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to what would have been in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. (viii) Rights Plans. To the extent that the Corporation has a rights plan if effect on any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock Holders shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation of such rights as if the Corporation made a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock as described in clause (iv) above. (b) Adjustment for Tax Reasons. The Corporation may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 14, if the Board of Directors deems it advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or from any event treated as a dividend or distribution for income tax purposes or for any other reasons; provided that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate. -16-
(c) Calculation of Adjustments. All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share (or, if there is not a nearest 1/10,000 of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000 of a share) of Common Stock. If an adjustment is made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v) or 14(a)(vi), an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made to the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price.

(d) Notice of Adjustment. Whenever each Fixed Conversion Rate is to be adjusted in accordance with Section 14(a), the Corporation shall: (i) compute each Fixed Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 14(a) and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officer's Certificate setting forth each Fixed Conversion Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires or permits an adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14(a) hereof (or if the Corporation is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide a written notice to the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock of the occurrence of such event; and (iii) as soon as practicable following the determination of each revised Fixed Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 14(a) hereof, a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth each revised Fixed Conversion Rate. (e) Reorganization Events. In the event of: (i) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Corporation is the continuing corporation and in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation is not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Corporation or another Person); (ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation; (iii) any reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock; or (iv) any statutory exchange of securities of the Corporation with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) (any such event specified in this Section 14(e), a "Reorganization Event"); -17-
each share of Convertible Preferred Stock immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, after such Reorganization Event, be convertible into the kind of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon which have a record date that is prior to the conversion date) per share of Common Stock (the "Exchange Property") by a holder of Common Stock that (1) is not a person with which the Corporation consolidated or into which the Corporation merged or which merged into the Corporation or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such person, a "Constituent Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Corporation and non-Affiliates, and (2) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("Non-electing Share"), then, for the purpose of this Section 14(e) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each Non-electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-electing Shares). The amount of Exchange Property receivable upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock shall be determined based upon the Conversion Rate in effect on such Conversion Date. The applicable Conversion Rate shall be (x) the Minimum Conversion Rate, in the case of an Early Conversion Date or a Provisional Conversion Date, and (y) determined based upon the definition of Conversion Rate set forth in Section 7, in the case of the Mandatory Conversion Date or a Merger Early Conversion Date. For purposes of this Section 14(e), "Applicable Market Value" shall be deemed to refer to the Applicable Market Value of the Exchange Property and such value shall be determined (A) with respect to any publicly traded securities that compose all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the Closing Price of such securities, (B) in the case of any cash that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the amount of such cash and (C) in the case of any other property that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the value of such property, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose. For purposes of this Section 14(e), the term "Closing Price" shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property.

The above provisions of this Section 14(e) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 14 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or any successor) received by the holders of Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event. The Corporation shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property. The Corporation shall also -18-
issue a press release containing such information and publish such information on its website on the World Wide Web. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 14(e). (15) Replacement Stock Certificates. (a) If physical certificates are issued, and any of the Convertible Preferred Stock certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Corporation shall, at the expense of the Holder, issue, in exchange and in substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Convertible Preferred Stock certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the Convertible Preferred Stock certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Convertible Preferred Stock certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent amount of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, but only upon receipt of evidence of such loss, theft or destruction of such Convertible Preferred Stock certificate and indemnity, if requested, satisfactory to the Corporation and the Transfer Agent. (b) The Corporation is not required to issue any certificates representing the Convertible Preferred Stock on or after the Mandatory Conversion Date or any Provisional Conversion Date.

(16) Transfer Agent and Registrar. The duly appointed Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be The Bank of New York.

(a) Convertible Preferred Stock shall be issued in the form of one or more permanent global shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in definitive, fully registered form with the global legend (the "Global Shares Legend"), as set forth on the form of Convertible Preferred Stock certificate attached hereto as Exhibit A (each, a "Global Preferred Share"), which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Certificate. The Global Preferred Share may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rules, agreements to which the Corporation is subject, if any, or usage (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Corporation). The Global Preferred Share shall be deposited on behalf of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby with the Registrar, at its New York office, as custodian for DTC or a Depositary, and registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary, duly executed by the Corporation and countersigned and registered by the Registrar as hereinafter provided. The aggregate number of -19-
shares represented by each Global Preferred Share may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Registrar and the Depositary or its nominee as hereinafter provided. This Section 17(a) shall apply only to a Global Preferred Share deposited with or on behalf of the Depositary. The Corporation shall execute and the Registrar shall, in accordance with this Section, countersign and deliver initially one or more Global Preferred Shares that (i) shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co. or other nominee of the Depositary and (ii) shall be delivered by the Registrar to Cede & Co. or pursuant to instructions received from Cede & Co. or held by the Registrar as custodian for the Depositary pursuant to an agreement between the Depositary and the Registrar. Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under this Certificate with respect to any Global Preferred Share held on their behalf by the Depositary or by the Registrar as the custodian of the Depositary or under such Global Preferred Share, and the Depositary may be treated by the Corporation, the Registrar and any agent of the Corporation or the Registrar as the absolute owner of such Global Preferred Share for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Corporation, the Registrar or any agent of the Corporation or the Registrar from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices of the Depositary governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Preferred Share. Owners of beneficial interests in Global Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, unless (x) DTC is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Global Preferred Share and the Corporation does not appoint a qualified replacement for DTC within 90 days, (y) DTC ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Exchange Act or (z) the Corporation decides to discontinue the use of book-entry transfer through DTC (or any successor Depositary). In any such case, the Global Preferred Share shall be exchanged in whole for definitive shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in registered form, with the same terms and of an equal aggregate Liquidation Preference. Definitive shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be registered in the name or names of the Person or Person specified by DTC in a written instrument to the Registrar. (b) (i) An Officer shall sign the Global Preferred Share for the Corporation, in accordance with the Corporation's bylaws and applicable law, by manual or facsimile signature. (ii) If an Officer whose signature is on a Global Preferred Share no longer holds that office at the time the Transfer Agent authenticates the Global Preferred Share, the Global Preferred Share shall be valid nevertheless. (iii) A Global Preferred Share shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Transfer Agent manually countersigns Global Preferred Share. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Global Preferred Share has been authenticated under this Certificate. Each Global Preferred Share shall be dated the date of its authentication.
