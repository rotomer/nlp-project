news release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     New York, New York....July 28, 2004...Amerada Hess Corporation (NYSE: AHC) reported net income of $288 million for the second quarter of 2004 compared with income of $252 million for the second quarter of 2003. Net income in the second quarter of 2004 and 2003 includes income of $7 million and $189 million, respectively, from discontinued operations. The after-tax results by major operating activity in 2004 and 2003 are as follows:
     Exploration and production earnings from continuing operations were $182 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared with $88 million in the second quarter of 2003. The Corporation's oil and gas production, on a barrel-of-oil equivalent basis, was 351,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2004, a decrease of 7% from the second quarter of 2003. The decline in production was primarily due to asset sales and exchanges in 2003. In the second quarter of 2004, the Corporation's average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $25.76 per barrel, an increase of $1.66 per barrel from the second quarter of 2003. The Corporation's average United States natural gas selling price,
 
including the effect of hedging, was $5.23 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2004, an increase of $1.14 per Mcf from the second quarter of 2003. Exploration and production earnings include an after-tax gain of $15 million in the second quarter of 2004 from the sale of a non-producing asset and after-tax charges of $6 million and $23 million in the second quarter of 2004 and 2003, respectively, for accrued severance and a reduction in leased office space in London.
     Refining and marketing earnings were $160 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared with $46 million in the second quarter of 2003. The increase principally reflects higher refining margins and increased utilization rates. Refining and marketing earnings in the second quarter of 2003 included a net loss of $20 million from the sale of the Corporation's interest in a shipping joint venture.
     Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2004 amounted to $372 million of which $357 million related to exploration and production activities. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2003 amounted to $367 million, including $339 million for exploration and production.
 
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99(2)
Thank you Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I would like to make a few brief comments on our second quarter financial results and update you on some of our key development projects.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $281 million.
Our refining and marketing business posted outstanding quarterly earnings of $160 million. These results benefited from our world-class HOVENSA joint venture refinery, which ran near full capacity during the quarter and experienced strong refining margins.
Exploration and production generated net income of $182 million for the second quarter. These results reflected solid production
performance, improving unit costs, and strong oil and natural gas prices.
 
Worldwide oil and gas production averaged 349 thousand barrels of oil
equivalent per day for the first half of the year. As a result of this production
performance, we are raising our full-year 2004 production guidance to 340 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day from 325 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, in the third quarter, we anticipate lower production, versus the first half of the year, primarily as a result of normal North Sea facilities maintenance.
Regarding some of our key development projects ...
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Llano field, in which we have a 50% interest, commenced production on April 30. Net production is in excess of 14 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is somewhat above our initial expectation.
On Block A-18 in the Malaysia-Thailand JDA, the offshore pipe lay was completed during the second quarter and construction of the onshore portion of the pipeline is on schedule to be completed by early 2005. It is estimated that first gas production will occur during the first half of 2005.
 
In Equatorial Guinea, the Plan of Development for the Northern Block G fields was submitted to the government on June 7. As we have stated
previously, first production is expected to occur some 30 months after receiving government approval.
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly, who will provide more details on our financial results, after which we will be happy to take your questions.
