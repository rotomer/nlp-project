Item 1.01--Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. This form 8-K is to describe ordinary course director compensation actions taken by the Board of Directors of Amerada Hess Corporation. Effective January 1, 2005, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the annual retainer for non-management directors from $55,000 to $75,000. The Board also approved an additional annual cash award equal to the market price of 500 shares of Amerada Hess Corporation common stock to enable directors to purchase an equivalent number of shares. The Board of Directors increased meeting fees for non-management directors from $1,500 to $2,000 per meeting. Furthermore, the Board increased compensation for the Audit Committee service to reflect the additional responsibilities of this committee. The chairman of the Audit Committee's compensation was raised to $10,000 and the members' compensation was raised to $7,500. These changes in director compensation were approved by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of Amerada Hess Corporation following a presentation by a consultant who reviewed the general trends in Board compensation toward increased retainer fees, differentiated pay for Committee service and full value share awards. The Board also approved a stock ownership guideline for directors as a part of corporate governance best practices. The guideline requires each director to own and hold at least 5,000 shares of Amerada Hess Common Stock within 6 years of such director's first election to the Board or within two years of adoption of the guideline, whichever is later.
