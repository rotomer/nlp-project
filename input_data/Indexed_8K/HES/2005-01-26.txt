EXHIBIT 99.1 Amerada Hess Reports Estimated Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2004 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 26, 2005--Amerada Hess Corporation (NYSE:AHC) reported net income of $229 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with income of $68 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. For the full year, net income was $977 million compared with income of $643 million in 2003. See the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after-tax results by major operating activity in 2004 and 2003 are as follows: Three months ended Year ended December 31 December 31 ------------------- --------------- 2004* 2003* 2004* 2003 --------- -------- -------- ------ (In millions, except per share amounts) Exploration and production $211 $83 $755 $414 Refining and marketing 93 55 451 327 Corporate (36) (29) (85) (101) Interest expense (39) (41) (151) (173) --------- -------- -------- ------ Income from continuing operations 229 68 970 467 Discontinued operations Net gains from asset sales - - - 116 Income from operations - - 7 53 Income from cumulative effect of accounting change - - - 7 --------- -------- -------- ------ Net income $229 $68 $977 $643 ========= ======== ======== ====== Income per share from continuing operations (diluted) $2.22 $.71 $9.50 $5.17 ========= ======== ======== ====== Net income per share (diluted) $2.22 $.71 $9.57 $7.11 ========= ======== ======== ====== * Unaudited Exploration and production earnings were $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Corporation's oil and gas production, on a barrel-of-oil equivalent basis, was 346,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2004, a decrease of 3% from the fourth quarter of 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Corporation's average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $27.15 per barrel, an increase of $1.81 per barrel from the fourth quarter of 2003. The Corporation's average United States natural gas selling price was $5.83 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of $1.87 per Mcf from the fourth quarter of 2003. The Corporation has two exploration wells currently drilling in the Gulf of Mexico that have been capitalized on its balance sheet at December 31, 2004. The accounting treatment for these costs will be determined when drilling is completed, which is currently anticipated prior to the filing of the Corporation's Form 10-K in March. If either or both of these wells are unsuccessful, the applicable well costs through December 31, 2004 will be expensed, reducing exploration and production earnings up to $35 million, after-tax. Refining and marketing earnings were $93 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher refining margins and increased earnings from retail marketing operations. The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in net income in the fourth quarter and full year of 2004 and 2003 (in millions): Three months ended Year ended December 31 December 31 ------------------ ------------- 2004 2003 2004 2003 ---------- ------- ------- ----- Gains (losses) from asset sales: Exploration and production $21 $- $54 $31 Refining and marketing - - - (20) Income tax adjustments 19 - 32 30 LIFO inventory liquidation 12 - 12 - Corporate insurance accrual (13) - (13) - Accrued severance and office costs - (9) (9) (32) Premiums on bond repurchases - (19) - (34) ---------- ------- ------- ----- $39 $(28) $76 $(25) ========== ======= ======= ===== The fourth quarter 2004 asset sale reflects the disposal of two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. Exploration and production earnings also include foreign income tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting from a change in tax law and a tax settlement. Refining and marketing results include income in the fourth quarter as a result of a partial liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories. Capital expenditures for the year 2004 amounted to $1,521 million of which $1,434 million related to exploration and production activities. Capital expenditures for the year 2003 amounted to $1,358 million, including $1,286 million for exploration and production.

Amerada Hess Corporation Table of Pre-Tax Items In the table on page 2, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. The following table contains the pre-tax amounts of the applicable items included in net income which are shown on an after-tax basis on page 2 (in millions): Three months ended Year ended December 31 December 31 ------------------- ------------- 2004 2003 2004 2003 ------------ ------ ------- ----- Gains (losses) from asset sales: Exploration and production $32 $- $55 $47 Refining and marketing - - - (9) LIFO inventory liquidation 20 - 20 - Corporate insurance accrual (20) - (20) - Accrued severance and office costs - (15) (15) (53) Premiums on bond repurchases - (31) - (58) ------------ ------ ------- ----- $32 $(46) $40 $(73) ============ ====== ======= ===== CONTACT: Amerada Hess Corporation J.R.

EXHIBIT 99.2 2004 FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL -------------------------------------------- THANK YOU JAY, AND WELCOME TO OUR FOURTH QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS ON SOME KEY ACHIEVEMENTS OF 2004 AND PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE FOR 2005 AND THEN JOHN RIELLY WILL REVIEW THE FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIALS BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS. IN 2004, WE HAD A SOLID YEAR OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND WE CONTINUED TO MAKE PROGRESS IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, EXPLORATION PROGRAM, GROWING OUR RESERVES AND STRENGTHENING OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. IN TERMS OF OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, CORPORATE NET INCOME FOR 2004 WAS $977 MILLION. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION HAD A STRONG YEAR: EARNINGS WERE $755 MILLION AND PRODUCTION AVERAGED 342 THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT PER DAY COMPARED TO OUR ORIGINAL FORECAST OF 325,000 BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT PER DAY. IN 2005, WE FORECAST WORLDWIDE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION TO AVERAGE 350 THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT PER DAY. REFINING AND MARKETING ALSO HAD A VERY STRONG YEAR EARNING $451 MILLION. THE HOVENSA AND PORT READING REFINERIES WERE ABLE TO OPERATE AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE YEAR ENABLING THEM TO BENEFIT FROM THE STRONG MARGIN ENVIRONMENT. OUR RETAIL AND ENERGY MARKETING BUSINESSES ALSO PERFORMED WELL. IN TERMS OF OUR FIELD DEVELOPMENTS, SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WAS MADE IN 2004. o IN APRIL, THE LLANO FIELD COMMENCED PRODUCTION AND OUR 50 PERCENT INTEREST IS CURRENTLY AVERAGING ABOUT 20 THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT PER DAY. THIS LEVEL OF PRODUCTION IS HIGHER THAN OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATE. o IN AUGUST, THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR OUR NORTHERN BLOCK G FIELDS, WHICH WILL NOW BE CALLED THE OKUME COMPLEX, WAS APPROVED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA. MOST OF THE MAJOR CONTRACTS FOR CONSTRUCTION HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED. THE DEVELOPMENT IS ON SCHEDULE AND ON BUDGET. o IN AUGUST, THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT TO REDEVELOP THE GASSI EL AGREB FIELDS IN ALGERIA WAS EXPANDED FROM AN ORIGINAL INVESTMENT COMMITMENT OF $570 MILLION TO $950 MILLION. THIS CHANGE IN SCOPE REFLECTS OUR SUCCESS IN THE AREA. SINCE 2000, WE HAVE GROWN GROSS PRODUCTION FROM 20,000 BOEPD TO 55,000 BOEPD AND WE SEE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE RESERVES AND PRODUCTION. o IN DECEMBER, WE NEGOTIATED ADDITIONAL GAS SALES FROM BLOCK A-18 IN THE MALAYSIA-THAILAND JOINT DEVELOPMENT AREA. THE AGREEMENT WILL ALLOW US TO DOUBLE OUR PROVED RESERVES IN THE JDA OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANT FUTURE PRODUCTION GROWTH. FIRST SALES OF NATURAL GAS FROM THE JDA ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER. o IN DECEMBER, WE SANCTIONED THE UJUNG PANGKAH DEVELOPMENT IN INDONESIA. GAS SALES FROM PANGKAH SHOULD COMMENCE BY EARLY 2007.
IN TERMS OF EXPLORATION, SUCCESSFUL DRILLING RESULTS AT OUR SHENZI PROSPECT IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO, AND THE PHU HORM AND BELUD PROSPECTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE RESERVE AND PRODUCTION GROWTH. IN ADDITION, OUR PROSPECT INVENTORY IS ROBUST AND WE WILL DRILL SEVERAL HIGH IMPACT WELLS IN 2005. WITH REGARD TO OUR YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES, WE ARE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT IN 2004, WE REPLACED 110 PERCENT OF PRODUCTION, AT A FINDING AND DEVELOPMENT COST OF ABOUT $11 PER BARREL. THIS RESULT COMES DESPITE THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE PSC REVISIONS OF 31 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT RELATING TO HIGH YEAR-END COMMODITY PRICES. PROVED RESERVES, AT YEAR-END, WERE 1.046 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT AND OUR RESERVE TO PRODUCTION RATIO IMPROVED TO 8.2 YEARS COMPARED TO 7.5 YEARS LAST YEAR. IN TERMS OF OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2004 AMOUNTED TO $1.5 BILLION OF WHICH $1.4 BILLION RELATED TO EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT OF THE SOLID OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR ASSETS AND THE STRONG PRICING ENVIRONMENT IN 2004, WE IMPROVED OUR DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION RATIO BY 2 PERCENT TO 40.7 PERCENT AT THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR 2005, OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE FORECAST TO BE $2.1 BILLION, WITH $2.0 BILLION DEDICATED TO EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION. THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF SPENDING REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S STRONG PORTFOLIO OF ORGANIC GROWTH PROJECTS AND ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CASH FLOW WILL BE ROUGHLY BALANCED IN 2005 ASSUMING A WTI PRICE OF ABOUT $35 PER BARREL AND OUR DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION RATIO SHOULD CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THROUGH THE YEAR. WITH AN IMPROVING BALANCE SHEET, APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION OF CASH, AND A NEW $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OUR COMPANY HAS THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND OUR DEVELOPMENTS AND DRILLING PROGRAMS. IN SUMMARY, WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR ASSETS AND OUR ORGANIZATION IN 2004 AND ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING FOR THE FUTURE WILL GROW OUR RESERVES AND PRODUCTION PROFITABLY AND CREATE LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS. I WILL NOW TURN THE CALL OVER TO JOHN RIELLY, WHO WILL PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.
