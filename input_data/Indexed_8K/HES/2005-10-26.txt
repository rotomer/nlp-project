Exhibit 99.1 Amerada Hess Reports Estimated Results for the Third Quarter of 2005 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2005--Amerada Hess Corporation (NYSE:AHC) reported net income of $272 million for the third quarter of 2005 compared with income of $178 million for the third quarter of 2004. See the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after-tax results by major operating activity in 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Three months ended Nine months ended September 30 September 30 (unaudited) (unaudited) ------------------ ------------------ 2005 2004 2005 2004 -------- -------- -------- -------- (In millions, except per share amounts) Exploration and production $ 235 $ 155 $ 760 $ 544 Refining and marketing 125 85 286 358 Corporate (54) (23) (151) (49) Interest expense (34) (39) (105) (112) -------- -------- -------- -------- Net income from continuing operations $ 272 $ 178 $ 790 $ 741 Discontinued operations - - - 7 -------- -------- -------- -------- Net income $ 272 $ 178 $ 790 $ 748 ======== ======== ======== ======== Net income per share (diluted) $ 2.60 $ 1.74 $ 7.61 $ 7.34 ======== ======== ======== ======== Weighted average number of shares (diluted) 104.4 102.4 103.8 101.8 ======== ======== ======== ======== Exploration and production earnings were $235 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared with $155 million in the third quarter of 2004. The Corporation's oil and gas production, on a barrel-of-oil equivalent basis, was 312,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2005 compared with 323,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2004. Hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico reduced third quarter 2005 production by approximately 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This decrease is estimated to have reduced third quarter exploration and production earnings by approximately $25 million. The Corporation also incurred incremental third quarter expenses related to the hurricanes of $14 million, after income taxes. In the third quarter of 2005, the Corporation's average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $35.74 per barrel, an increase of $9.01 per barrel from the third quarter of 2004. The Corporation's average United States natural gas selling price was $8.53 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2005, an increase of $4.13 per Mcf from the third quarter of 2004. Refining and marketing earnings were $125 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared with $85 million in the third quarter of 2004. The increase in refining and marketing earnings was due to higher refining earnings, reflecting improved margins, partially offset by lower marketing results. The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in net income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 and 2004 (in millions): Three months ended Nine months ended September 30 September 30 ------------------ ----------------- 2005 2004 2005 2004 --------- -------- -------- -------- Exploration and production - -------------------------- Hurricane related costs $ (14) $ - $ (14) $ - Income tax adjustments - - 11 - Gains from asset sales - - 11 34 Legal settlement - - 11 - Corporate - --------- Premiums on bond repurchases - - (7) - Income tax adjustments (31) - (72) 13 --------- -------- -------- -------- $ (45) $ - $ (60) $ 47 ========= ======== ======== ======== The corporate tax charges in the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 represent income tax provisions related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Capital and exploratory expenditures in the third quarter of 2005 amounted to $699 million compared with $381 million in the third quarter of 2004. Of these amounts, $674 million and $363 million in the third quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to exploration and production activities.

Exhibit 99.2 Amerada Hess - 3rd Quarter 2005 Conference Call Comments by John Hess Thank you Jay, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I would like to make a few brief comments after which John O'Connor will provide an update of our exploration and production operations. John Rielly will then review the financial results for the quarter. Turning first to exploration and production, our third quarter results benefited from record oil and natural gas prices. Production averaged 312 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Hurricane related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and temporary facilities issues at several non-operated fields in the North Sea resulted in production being 3% below the year ago quarter. As of today, we have restored about 50% of our total Gulf of Mexico production of 51 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, impacted by the hurricanes. We expect to have over 85% of our production restored in November and more than 90% in December. Despite these short-term production effects, our exploration and production business is progressing favorably. Our development projects are on schedule and on budget, and we will drill some key exploration wildcats over the next two quarters. Two weeks ago, we announced an agreement with Apache Corporation to acquire its 55% working interest in the deepwater section of the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession in Egypt for $413 million. In a separate transaction, Apache will acquire, subject to the exercise of preferential rights, Amerada Hess' interests in eight fields located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico for $404 million. This West Med acquisition fits with our strategy to grow our international natural gas business, and we believe that our deepwater and subsea experience will be a significant advantage as we develop the existing gas discoveries. In addition, we see further exploration potential on the block which will enhance our global exploration portfolio. Also in October, our Russian venture, Samara-Nafta, acquired two additional leases in the Volga-Urals region, bringing Amerada Hess' investment in Russia to approximately $230 million. With regard to refining and marketing, our operations performed well during the third quarter. The Hovensa joint-venture refinery benefited from a strong margin environment, but operated at somewhat reduced throughput as a result of a scheduled turnaround of the #6 crude unit. Our marketing activities were negatively impacted by lower margins during the quarter. I will now turn the call over to John O'Connor.

Exhibit 99.3 Amerada Hess - 3rd Quarter 2005 Conference Call Comments by John O'Connor As with other operators in the Gulf of Mexico we continue to make progress recovering from the effects of the two storms. Katrina destroyed our shore base at Venice, LA and severely damaged production facilities in the Main Pass / Breton Sound area which had been producing four thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Hurricane Rita did not harm our production facilities, but we have been impacted by the damage to downstream gathering and processing infrastructure. We are grateful however, that none of our people were injured. Overall, the hurricane related reduction to third quarter production averaged nine thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Hurricane related production effects will continue into the fourth quarter which may cause as much as an average of 17 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day to be deferred. The third quarter is typically a period of intense maintenance activity in the North Sea and West of Shetlands. This year was no exception. However, several partner-operated turnarounds took longer than expected, the net effect of which was a deferral of some five thousand barrels per day for the quarter. In addition, the fire on BP's Schiehallion facility in July resulted in a deferral of some four thousand barrels per day of production during the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, a major turnaround is now scheduled at the Schiehallion Field. This, together with a number of short-term facilities issues in the region will likely lower production by an additional 10 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. At the Malaysia-Thailand JDA, the buyers of the gas remain in the commissioning phase with their onshore gas plant. While the gas is contracted with take-or-pay agreements, thus keeping us whole economically, we are reducing our production forecast for the fourth quarter by 12 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. In consideration of these issues, we have revised our fourth quarter production forecast to 320-330 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. In addition to production, the hurricanes have impacted rig availability and thus the timing of our Gulf of Mexico wildcat program. Ouachita and Barossa are now scheduled to spud near year-end, and Turtle Lake in mid-2006. The Pony well, however, remains on schedule for a November spud and will take 100-120 days to reach TD (total depth). I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.
