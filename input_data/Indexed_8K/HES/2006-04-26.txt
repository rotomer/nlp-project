First quarter 2006 results included an after-tax gain of $186 million related to the sale of certain producing properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. The Corporation's oil and gas production, on a barrel-of-oil equivalent basis, was 361,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2006 compared with 358,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2005.

Refining earnings were $21 million in the first quarter of 2006 compared with $42 million in the first quarter of 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, earnings from HOVENSA were adversely impacted by the unscheduled shutdown and maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit which lasted for approximately 20 days. Marketing operations generated earnings of $12 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared with $13 million in the same period of 2005.
