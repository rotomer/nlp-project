Exhibit 99.1 Hess Reports Estimated Results for the Second Quarter of 2006 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 26, 2006--Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) reported net income of $565 million for the second quarter of 2006 compared with net income of $299 million for the second quarter of 2005. See the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after-tax results by major operating activity were as follows: Three months Six months ended ended June 30 June 30 (unaudited) (unaudited) ----------------- ----------------- 2006 2005 2006 2005 -------- -------- -------- -------- (In millions, except per share amounts) Exploration and Production $ 501 $ 263 $ 1,207 $ 526 Marketing and Refining 121 98 170 161 Corporate (29) (28) (52) (97) Interest expense (28) (34) (65) (72) -------- -------- -------- -------- Net income $ 565 $ 299 $ 1,260 $ 518 ======== ======== ======== ======== Net income per share (diluted)* $ 1.79 $ 0.96 $ 4.00 $ 1.67 ======== ======== ======== ======== Weighted average number of shares (diluted)* 315.5 311.2 315.2 310.5 ======== ======== ======== ======== * Weighted average number of shares and per-share amounts in all periods reflect the impact of the 3-for-1 stock split on May 31, 2006. Exploration and Production earnings were $501 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared with $263 million in the second quarter of 2005. The Corporation's oil and gas production, on a barrel-of-oil equivalent basis, was 354,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2006 compared with 355,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2005. In the second quarter of 2006, the Corporation's average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $59.00 per barrel, an increase of $26.53 per barrel from the second quarter of 2005. The increase reflects higher crude oil prices and reduced hedge positions in 2006. The Corporation's average United States natural gas selling price was $6.23 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2006, compared to $6.47 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2005. Marketing and Refining earnings were $121 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared with $98 million in the second quarter of 2005. Refining earnings were $107 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared with $77 million in the second quarter of 2005. The increased Refining earnings principally reflect higher refined product margins. Marketing operations generated earnings of $15 million in the second quarter of 2006, compared with $14 million in the same period of 2005. The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in net income (in millions): Three months Six months ended ended June 30 June 30 ----------------- ----------------- 2006 2005 2006 2005 -------- -------- -------- -------- Exploration and Production - -------------------------- Gains from asset sales $ 50 $ - $ 236 $ 11 Accrued office closing costs (18) - (18) - Income tax adjustments - 11 - 11 Legal settlement - - - 11 Corporate - --------- Tax on repatriated earnings - - - (41) Premiums on bond repurchases - (7) - (7) -------- -------- -------- -------- $ 32 $ 4 $ 218 $ (15) ======== ======== ======== ======== Second quarter 2006 results included a gain related to the sale of onshore Gulf Coast oil and gas producing assets and a charge for vacated leased office space.

Exhibit 99.2 Hess Corporation - 2nd Quarter 2006 Conference Call Comments by John Hess Thank you Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. As usual, I will make a few brief comments after which John Rielly will review the financial results for the quarter. Turning to Exploration and Production, our second quarter results, compared to a year ago, benefited from strong oil prices, offset partially by higher international income taxes. Production averaged 354 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2005. For 2006, our current production forecast is 360-370 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is at the lower end of the range of our original guidance. Price effects from our production sharing contracts and asset sales account for the bulk of this revision. We continue to make excellent progress in advancing our field developments. The Okume Complex, Pangkah, and Phu Horm developments are all on schedule to commence production in early 2007. Also, in the second quarter, the Shenzi development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where we have a 28% interest, was sanctioned by the operator BHP Billiton. Major contracts have been committed and the project is scheduled to commence production in 2009. In the United Kingdom, production from the Atlantic and Cromarty Fields commenced in June and averaged 13 million cubic feet per day for the second quarter. Net production from the fields is currently averaging about 80 million cubic feet per day. Regarding our exploration activities, during the second quarter we announced a discovery at our 100% owned Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The well was drilled to a total depth of 32,448 feet, and encountered 475 feet of oil saturated sandstones in Miocene age reservoirs. After we complete data gathering, we will drill a sidetrack which is intended to evaluate the prospective section 4,000 feet to the northeast of the discovery well. Also in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are drilling our Ouachita and Alsace prospects on Green Canyon 376 and Garden Banks 243, respectively, as well as a Tubular Bells appraisal well on Mississippi Canyon 682. These wells have not yet reached their targeted objectives. With regard to Marketing and Refining, refining was the major contributor to improved earnings in the second quarter versus the prior year period. The HOVENSA and Port Reading refineries both benefited from the strong margin environment. Similar to last year, retail marketing margins were squeezed during the second quarter as wholesale prices rose more quickly than pump prices. Our current estimate of 2006 capital and exploratory expenditures is $4.1-4.3 billion. This level of spending is up from our previous forecast of $4.0 billion. The increase largely reflects: our success at Pony which has resulted in the addition of a sidetrack well and an appraisal well into our 2006 program; the acquisition of new leases in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and accelerated development drilling at the Okume Complex. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.
