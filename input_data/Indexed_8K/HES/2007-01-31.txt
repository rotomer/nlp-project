HESS REPORTS ESTIMATED RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006
 
NEW YORK, January 31, 2007
--
 
Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES)
 
Hess Corporation reported net income of $359 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with net income of $452 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. For the full year, net income was $1,916 million compared with $1,242 million in 2005. See the following page for a table and description of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after-tax results by major operating activity were as follows:
 
* Unaudited
** Weighted average number of shares and per-share amounts in all periods reflect the impact of the 3-for-1 stock split on May 31, 2006.
Exploration and Production earnings were $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with $298 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
The Corporations oil and gas production, on a barrel-of-oil equivalent basis, was 366,000
barrels per day
in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with 316,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Corporations average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $50.76 per barrel, an increase of $16.67 per barrel from the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase primarily reflects reduced hedge positions in 2006. The Corporations average worldwide natural gas selling price was $5.25 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $7.14 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Marketing and Refining earnings were $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with $229 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Refining earnings were $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 principally reflecting lower refined product margins. Marketing earnings were $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with $131 million in the same period of 2005, primarily reflecting lower margins. Earnings from trading operations were $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in net income (in millions):
 
The gains from asset sales for the year 2006 relate to the sale of certain United States producing properties. During 2006 the United Kingdom increased the supplementary tax on petroleum operations from 10% to 20%. As a result, the Corporation recorded a $45 million adjustment to its United Kingdom deferred tax liability. The year 2006 results also include a charge for vacated leased office space.
 
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,491 million in 2006 compared with $1,840 million in 2005. Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 totaled $444 million. Capital and exploratory expenditures for the year 2006 amounted to $4,056 million of which $3,887 million related to Exploration and Production activities. Capital and exploratory expenditures for the year 2005 amounted to $2,490 million, including $2,384 million for Exploration and Production.
At December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents totaled $383 million compared with $315 million at December 31, 2005. Total debt was $3,772 million at December 31, 2006 and $3,785 million at December 31, 2005. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2006 was 31.7% compared with 37.6% at the end of 2005.

Thank you Jay, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I would like to make a brief comments highlighting some key achievements of 2006 and provide some guidance for 2007. John OConnor will then discuss our Exploration and Production business, after which John Rielly will review our financial results.
few
2006 was a year of record financial performance for our Company. Our results benefited from the strong commodity price environment which existed for much of the year. Corporate net income was $1.9 billion. Exploration and Production earned nearly $1.8 billion, and Marketing and Refining earned $390 million.
Capital and exploratory expenditures in 2006 amounted to just under $4.1 billion, of which about $ 3.9 billion was related to Exploration and Production activities. For 2007, our capital and exploratory expenditures are budgeted to be approximately $4.0 billion, of which about $3.9 billion relates to Exploration and Production, including our acquisition of a 28% working interest in the Genghis Khan Field in the Gulf of Mexico.
 
We enhanced the strength of our financial position during the year, with our debt to capitalization ratio improving to 31.7% at the end of 2006 versus 37.6% at the end of 2005.
During 2006, our operational achievements included:
 
With regard to crude oil and natural gas production, in 2006 our production averaged 359 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2007 we forecast that worldwide crude oil and natural gas production will average between 370 and 380 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is within our long term guidance of 3-5% production growth per year.
As to our major field developments, we made significant progress during 2006, including four field start-ups, ACG Phase 2, Atlantic / Cromarty, Phu Horm, and Okume. During the year we sanctioned the Shenzi deepwater development located in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico and advanced the Pangkah oil development in Indonesia and the Seminole ROZ project in the Permian Basin, all of which are scheduled to begin production in 2009.
In terms of exploration, we continued to have good success in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2006. We made a potentially significant discovery at our Pony prospect, on Green Canyon Block 468, and drilled a successful appraisal sidetrack which confirmed our pre-drill estimate of 100-600 million barrels of oil equivalent on our acreage. We have a 100% interest in the Pony prospect. In addition, successful appraisal drilling at our Tubular Bells prospect, on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 683 and 726, in which we have a 20% interest, has been very encouraging. Appraisal drilling at both these discoveries will continue in 2007.
With regard to Marketing and Refining, our businesses were negatively impacted by margin pressures and milder than normal weather. Our refineries operated reliably with the exception of some unplanned downtime at our HOVENSA joint venture early last year. We successfully completed low sulfur fuel projects at both HOVENSA and Port Reading during the year. In Retail Marketing, our annual convenience store revenues in 2006, excluding petroleum products, exceeded $1 billion for the first time. Energy Marketing achieved increased sales of both natural gas and electricity as a result of both organic growth and selective acquisitions, building a stronger and more profitable business for the future.
In summary, we are pleased with the performance of our assets and the strength of our organization. We remain confident that the investments we are making for the future will sustain profitable growth and create significant value for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to John OConnor.
Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements in this release may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, uncertainties inherent in the measurement and interpretation of geological, geophysical and other technical data.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, production of 366 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day was up 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2005. Two new Hess-operated fields, Okume Complex and Phu Horm, started up ahead of schedule and on budget. In the Gulf of Mexico we drilled and cored a successful appraisal well to our Pony discovery and we announced the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan Field, which is the western portion of the large Shenzi development in which we also have a 28% interest.
Overall, 2006 was a year of strong operational performance for Exploration & Production. We produced 359 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from 2005. More importantly, we replaced about 230% of production with new proved reserves of 310 million barrels of oil equivalent. Reserves growth year-on-year was 14%, resulting in year-end 2006 proved reserves of 1.24 billion barrels of oil equivalent and a reserve life of 9.3 years. Over the past three years we have replaced 162% of production at an average FD&A cost of about $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent.
During 2006 we continued to actively high grade our asset portfolio by selling non-core properties in the Permian and US Gulf Coast, and by entering the West Med block offshore Egypt and re-entering Libya.
In 2007 we expect production to be in the range of 370-380 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day net of planned asset sales, within our 3-5% per annum growth initiative. Okume Complex production will step up through the year with the addition of some five new wells per quarter, achieving plateau production in early 2008. In the second quarter of 2007 we will start gas production from Ujung Pangkah in Indonesia and in the third quarter we expect to start production from Genghis Khan. Gas production from the JDA fields will also increase in the second half of 2007 with the addition of some 200 million cubic feet per day gross of early Phase 2 gas to the current Phase 1 volumes of 350 million cubic feet per day. Full production from Phase II is scheduled for first quarter 2008.
In 2007 our drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico will focus on the development and appraisal of our three Miocene discoveries in the Green Canyon & Mississippi Canyon areas. Development drilling will continue on Shenzi and on Genghis Khan while appraisal drilling is underway at both Pony and Tubular Bells.
2006 was certainly a year of high activity and significant execution. 2007 promises to be just as active.
Now I will hand the call over to John Rielly.
