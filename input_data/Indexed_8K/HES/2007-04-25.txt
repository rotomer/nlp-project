EXHIBIT 99(1) Hess Reports Estimated Results for the First Quarter of 2007 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2007--Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) Hess Corporation reported net income of $370 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared with net income of $699 million for the first quarter of 2006. First quarter 2006 results included an after-tax gain of $186 million related to the sale of certain United States producing properties. The after-tax results by major operating activities were as follows: Three months ended March 31 (unaudited) ------------------------- 2007 2006* ---------- ---------- (In millions, except per share amounts) Exploration and Production $ 340 $ 706 Marketing and Refining 101 53 Corporate (31) (23) Interest expense (40) (37) ---------- ---------- Net income $ 370 $ 699 ========== ========== Net income per share (diluted) $ 1.17 $ 2.22 ========== ========== Weighted average number of shares (diluted) 317.3 314.8 ========== ========== * Reflects the retrospective adoption of a new accounting pronouncement related to refinery turnarounds and the impact of the Corporation's 3-for-1 stock split on May 31, 2006. Exploration and Production earnings were $340 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2006. The Corporation's oil and gas production, on a barrel-of-oil equivalent basis, was 382,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2007 compared with 361,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, the Corporation's average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $50.74 per barrel, a decrease of $2.56 per barrel from the first quarter of 2006. The Corporation's average worldwide natural gas selling price was $5.00 per Mcf in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $6.73 per Mcf in the first quarter of 2006. Marketing and Refining earnings were $101 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with $53 million in the first quarter of 2006. Refining earnings were $54 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with $25 million in the first quarter of 2006, reflecting higher refined product margins and volumes. In the first quarter of 2006, refining earnings were affected by the unscheduled shutdown and maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA. Marketing earnings were $43 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with $12 million in the same period of 2006, primarily reflecting higher margins. Earnings from trading operations were $4 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $16 million in the first quarter of 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities was $639 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with $1,198 million in the first quarter of 2006. Capital and exploratory expenditures for the first quarter of 2007 amounted to $1,181 million, of which $1,159 million related to Exploration and Production operations. These expenditures include $371 million for the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Capital and exploratory expenditures for the first quarter of 2006 amounted to $1,387 million, of which $1,354 million related to Exploration and Production operations. These expenditures included $673 million for the acquisition of assets in Egypt and the re-entry into Libya. At March 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents totaled $249 million compared with $383 million at December 31, 2006. Total debt was $4,141 million at March 31, 2007 and $3,772 million at December 31, 2006. The Corporation's debt to capitalization ratio at March 31, 2007 was 32.5% compared with 31.6% at the end of 2006. Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation retrospectively adopted a new accounting pronouncement related to refinery turnarounds. As a result of this accounting change, the Corporation's previously reported first quarter 2006 net income increased by $4 million, fourth quarter 2006 net income was unchanged and retained earnings as of December 31, 2006 increased by $36 million. All of the financial information presented in this release and the accompanying schedules reflect this retrospective accounting change. Hess Corporation will review first quarter financial and operating results and other matters on a webcast at 10 a.m. today.

EXHIBIT 99(2) 2007 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call Thank you Jay, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments after which John Rielly will review our financial results. Our first quarter 2007 Exploration and Production financial results were lower than the year ago quarter as the result of weaker commodity prices and higher production costs, which were partially offset by higher production volumes. First quarter 2007 oil and natural gas production averaged 382 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was about 6% above the year ago period. Our full year 2007 production forecast remains 370-380 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Looking at the balance of the year, worldwide production is anticipated to average in the range of 350-360 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day for the second and third quarters and then to increase to more than 400 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day for the fourth quarter. -1-
Our worldwide oil and natural gas production in 2007 is expected to be affected by several factors. Reductions in the second and third quarters will result from: o The sale of our interests in the Scott and Telford Fields in the UK North Sea, o A decision to reduce natural gas sales from the Cromarty Field during the second and third quarters, in response to market conditions in the United Kingdom, o The scheduled maintenance of our North Sea facilities, and o A 40 day planned shut down at the Malaysia-Thailand JDA during the third quarter to install facilities required for Phase 2 development. Growth during the year will come from: o The ramp-up in production from the Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea throughout the year, o The start-up of natural gas production from the Pangkah Field, in Indonesia, in May, and o The commencement of production from the Genghis Khan Field, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in the third quarter. -2-
Our field developments continue to make good progress. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our Shenzi development, in which Hess has a 28% interest, remains on schedule for initial production in mid-2009. The CR Luigs drillship is on location drilling development wells and all major contracts have been awarded. Construction of the TLP and topsides is underway and is on schedule and on budget. The focus of our exploration drilling program this year will be appraisal drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the commencement of exploration drilling in Australia in the fourth quarter. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, appraisal drilling at our Pony discovery, in which we have a 100% interest, is continuing. The results of the Pony #2 well are expected by the end of the second quarter. In addition, appraisal activities at the Tubular Bells discovery in which Hess has a 20% working interest will include a #3 well which is expected to spud in the fourth quarter of 2007. As a result of the success of the #2 well and sidetrack, we have increased the gross reserve estimate to 200-400 million barrels. -3-
Lastly, in the first quarter we acquired a 100% interest in an exploration license in the Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia. During the fourth quarter of 2007 and extending into early 2008, we will acquire 3-D seismic over the entire 780,000 acre block and drill four exploration wells. With regard to Marketing and Refining, our first quarter 2007 financial results strengthened versus the year ago quarter. In Refining, our results benefited from strong margins and operations, especially at our HOVENSA joint venture. In Energy Marketing, increased natural gas sales and higher margins contributed to improved financial performance. Lastly, in Retail Marketing, our business benefited from increased convenience store sales and higher gasoline margins than a year ago, but was negatively impacted by rising wholesale gasoline prices throughout the quarter. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. -4-
