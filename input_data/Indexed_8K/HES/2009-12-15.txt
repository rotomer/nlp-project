     (ii) each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, other than one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of Securities, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus; and
     (iii) any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company and the Representatives (including the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof) is listed on Schedule III(a) hereto;
     (b) The Company has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
     (c) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; , that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or
provided, however
 
omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     7. The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to the following conditions:
     (a) The representations and warranties of the Company contained herein are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date and the Company shall have complied with all agreements and all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date.
     (b) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Securities Act; the final term sheet contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall be in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose shall be pending before or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to your reasonable satisfaction.

     (d) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, business, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which in the
 
judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus; and neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus.

     (ii) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
     (iii) the Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, when duly authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, subject to customary exceptions;

     (g) Timothy B. Goodell, Esq., Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to you his written opinion, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that:
     (i) the Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, other than where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
     (ii) each of the Significant Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, other than where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and all of the issued shares of capital stock of each subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and (except in the case of foreign subsidiaries, for
 
directors' qualifying shares) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
     (iii) other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending against or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be a party or to which any property of the Company or its subsidiaries is or may be the subject which could individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the general affairs, business, prospects, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others; and such counsel does not know of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which are not filed or described as required;
     (iv) neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is, or with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would be, in violation of or in default under, (x) its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (or similar constitutive documents) or (y) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them or any of their respective properties is bound, except, in the case of this clause (y), for violations and defaults which individually and in the aggregate are not material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; the issue and sale of the Securities and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not (A) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or
 
any of the Significant Subsidiaries is subject, except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults as would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (B) result in any violation of (x) the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company or (y) any applicable law or statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties except, in the case of this clause (y), for violations that would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
     (v) the statements in the Prospectus incorporated by reference from Item 3 of Part 1 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and as such statements have been amended or supplemented by the Company's subsequent reports filed on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present in all material respects the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents or proceedings; and
     (vi) such counsel is of the opinion that each document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) complied as to form when filed with the Commission in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
     In rendering such opinions, White & Case LLP and Mr. Goodell may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of the United States and the States of New York and Delaware, to the extent such counsel deem proper and to the extent specified in such opinion, if at all, upon an opinion or opinions (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Underwriters' counsel) of other counsel reasonably acceptable to the Underwriters' counsel, familiar with the applicable laws; (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent such counsel deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and certificates or other written statements of officials of jurisdictions having custody of documents respecting the corporate existence or good standing of the Company. The opinion of each such counsel shall state that the opinion of any such other counsel upon which they relied is in form satisfactory to such counsel and, in such counsel's opinion, the Underwriters and they are justified in relying thereon. With respect to the matters to be covered in subparagraph (viii) of paragraph (f) above White & Case LLP may state their opinion and belief is based upon their participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and
 
any amendment or supplement thereto (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein) and review and discussion of the contents thereof (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) but is without independent check or verification except as specified.
     The opinions of White & Case LLP and Mr. Goodell described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.
     (h) On the date hereof and on the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to you letters, dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to you, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus.
     (i) You shall have received on and as of the Closing Date an opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel to the Underwriters, with respect to the validity of the Indenture and the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.
     (j) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further certificates and documents as the Representatives shall reasonably request.
     8. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including without limitation the reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
     Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing, and the Indemnifying Person, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons of Underwriters shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and such control persons of the Company or authorized representatives shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as
Indemnified Person
Indemnifying Person
 
contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request and (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 8 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and the commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount
pro rata
 
paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto, and not joint.
     The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any other person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     9. Notwithstanding anything herein contained, this Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex LLC, formerly known as NYSE Alternext US LLC and formerly known as the American Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial or economic conditions in or affecting the United States, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and which, in the judgment of the Representatives, makes it
 
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
     10. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase under this Agreement, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
     11. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any condition of the Underwriters' obligations cannot be fulfilled, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering of Securities.
     12. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, the Underwriters, any controlling persons referred to herein and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person, firm or
 
corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase.
     13. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
     14. Any action by the Underwriters hereunder may be taken by the Representatives alone on behalf of the Underwriters, and any such action taken by the Representatives shall be binding upon the Underwriters. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be given to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at 85 Broad Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., 270 Park Avenue, 8th floor, New York, New York 10017, Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk; and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, 1585 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, Attention: Investment Banking Division. Notices to the Company shall be given to it at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Corporate Secretary.
     In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
     15. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
 
     16. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
 
Acting severally on behalf of themselves and the several Underwriters listed in Schedule II hereto.

     This is one of the Global Notes of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 1, 2006 (the "Indenture") duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to The Bank of New York Mellon, successor-in-interest to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Note is one of a series of notes designated as the 6.00% Notes due 2040 (the "Notes") of the Issuer, issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000.
     In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Notes, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee to amend the Indenture and the Securities of any series with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of all series affected by such supplemental indenture (all such series voting as one class), and the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of all series affected thereby (all such series voting as one class) by written notice to the Trustee may waive future compliance by the Issuer with any provision of the Indenture or the Securities of such series; , that without the consent of each Holder affected thereby, no amendment or supplement and no waiver pursuant to Section 6.04 of the Indenture shall (i) extend the stated maturity of the Principal of, or any sinking fund obligation or any installment of interest on, such Holder's Securities, or reduce the Principal amount thereof or the
provided, however
 
rate of interest thereon (including any amount in respect of original issue discount), or any premium payable with respect thereto, or reduce the amount of the Principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture or the amount thereof provable in bankruptcy, or change any place of payment where, or the currency in which, any Security or any premium or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the due date therefor; (ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of outstanding Securities of the relevant series the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, for any waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain Defaults and their consequences provided for in the Indenture; (iii) waive a Default in the payment of Principal of or interest on any Security of such Holders; or (iv) modify any of the provisions of Section 9.02 of the Indenture, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Security affected thereby.
     It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain conditions, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of all series affected (voting as a single class), by notice to the Trustee, may waive an existing Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Security or in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Security affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
     The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000 and in book-entry form. The Notes may be represented by one or more global notes (each, a "Global Note") deposited with the Depositary and registered in the name
 
of the nominee of the Depositary, with certain limited exceptions. So long as DTC or any successor Depositary or its nominee is the registered Holder of a Global Note, DTC, such Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or Holder of the Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes. Beneficial interest in the Notes will be evidenced only by, and transfer thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants.

     No Global Note may be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary.

In such event, the Issuer will issue Notes in certificated form in exchange for such Global Notes. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in the Global Notes will be entitled to physical delivery in certificated form of Notes equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Notes registered in its name. Notes so issued in certificated form will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000, and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons.
     The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer as a whole, or part, at any time prior to maturity, upon mailing a notice of such redemption not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the Holders of Notes at their last registered addresses, all as further provided in the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of their principal amount or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date, on a semiannual basis assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
