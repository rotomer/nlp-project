On February 3, 2010, Hess Corporation's (the Company) Compensation and Management Development Committee (the Committee) approved, and on March 3, 2010, the Board of Directors adopted, an amendment (the Amendment) to the Company's 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2008 Incentive Plan), subject to the requisite stockholders approval, to increase the number of shares of the Companys common stock that may be issued under the 2008 Incentive Plan by 8,000,000 shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 5, 2010, stockholders approved the Amendment.
 
Under the 2008 Incentive Plan, as amended, a maximum of 21,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock will be available for delivery, plus up to 10,025,554 shares of common stock subject to outstanding options or other awards under the Companys Second Amended and Restated 1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan that are forfeited or are otherwise settled or terminated without a distribution of shares on or after March 15, 2010. The 2008 Incentive Plan, as amended, will continue in effect until all shares of common stock available under the 2008 Incentive Plan are delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the 2008 Incentive Plan is terminated earlier by the Board of Directors. However, no awards may be granted under the 2008 Incentive Plan on or after May 7, 2018.
