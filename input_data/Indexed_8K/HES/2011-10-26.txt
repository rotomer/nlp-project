Third Quarter Highlights:

NEW YORK, October 26, 2011
--
 
Note: See the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods.

Exploration and Production earnings were $422 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with $1,277 million in the third quarter of 2010.  The Corporations average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $85.81 per barrel, up from $64.81 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010. The average worldwide natural gas selling price of $5.74 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2011 was comparable with the selling price for the same quarter a year ago.  Third quarter oil and gas production was 344,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter a year ago, due to production interruptions in Libya and at the Valhall and Llano fields, the sale of certain natural gas assets in the United Kingdom North Sea in February and natural field declines, partially offset by higher production from the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota.
Marketing and Refining generated a loss of $23 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $38 million in the same period in 2010.  Refining operations incurred a loss of $38 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $50 million in the year ago quarter.  Marketing earnings of $41 million were comparable to the earnings for the third quarter of 2010.  Trading activities generated a loss of $26 million in the third quarter of 2011 and a loss of $28 million in the third quarter of last year.
The following table reflects the total after-tax income (expense) of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods:
 
Third quarter 2011 results include after-tax impairment charges of $140 million that resulted from increases to the Corporations abandonment liabilities, primarily for non-producing properties.  A charge of $44 million was also recorded as a result of the third quarter enactment of an additional 12 percent supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom with an effective date of March 24, 2011.  The charge consists of incremental income tax of $15 million on earnings from the effective date to the end of the second quarter and a charge of $29 million to increase the United Kingdom deferred tax liability.  The results

also include after-tax gains of $103 million from the sales of the Corporations interests in the Snorre Field, offshore Norway, and the Cook Field in the United Kingdom North Sea.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,022 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $1,246 million in the same quarter of 2010.  Capital and exploratory expenditures were $2,550 million, of which $2,517 million related to Exploration and Production operations, including $902 million for acreage acquisitions in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio and in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.  Capital and exploratory expenditures for the third quarter of 2010 were $1,567 million, of which $1,548 million related to Exploration and Production operations.
At September 30, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $827 million compared with $1,608 million at December 31, 2010.  Total debt was $5,592 million at September 30, 2011 and $5,583 million at December 31, 2010.  The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at September 30, 2011 was 22.8 percent compared with 24.9 percent at the end of 2010.

2011 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call
 
 
Thank you Jay and welcome to our third quarter conference call.  I will make a few brief comments after which John Rielly will review our financial results.
Net income for the third quarter of 2011 was $298 million versus $1.154 billion a year ago.  Our third quarter results included charges of $140 million for abandonment liabilities primarily in the UK North Sea and $44 million for an increase in the UK supplemental petroleum tax rate.  These charges were partially offset by a $103 million gain from the sale of Hess interests in the Snorre Field in Norway and the Cook Field in the United Kingdom.  Also, last years third quarter results included a net non-recurring gain of $725 million.  Excluding these adjustments, earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $379 million versus $429 million a year ago.
Exploration and Production reported net income of $422 million.  Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 344

thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 17 percent below the year ago period.  Aside from the sale of mature UK natural gas assets earlier in the year, most of the year over year production decline was due to several short term setbacks.  We are pleased to say that most of these issues are being resolved and that with the exception of Libya we are in the process of recovering lost volumes.
In Norway, a fire at the outside operated Valhall Field in July resulted in the field being shut in for more than two months, negatively impacting third quarter production by approximately 20 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.  Operations resumed September 17 and net production is currently averaging more than 30 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.

In the Gulf of Mexico, the Llano #3 well was producing at a net rate of approximately 10 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day prior to being shut in due to mechanical issues in the first

quarter of this year.  The operator plans to perform a workover and restore production in the first half of 2012.
In Libya, approximately 23 thousand barrels per day of net production remains shut in due to civil unrest.  We cannot estimate when production will resume until security returns to the country.
With regard to the Bakken, net production averaged 32 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, up from 25 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter.  Currently net production from the Bakken is approximately 39 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.  As a result of the increased acreage position from last years acquisitions and positive well results year to date, we forecast net production from the Bakken will increase to 60 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2012 and to 120 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015.

In September we announced the acquisition of 185,000 net acres in the emerging Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio principally through two separate transactions.  We entered into an agreement with CONSOL Energy, which closed last week, to acquire a 50 percent interest in nearly 200,000 acres for aggregate payments of $593 million over five years.  We also acquired Marquette Exploration and other leasehold interests, which added another 85,000 net acres at a cost of approximately $750 million.  With these transactions, we have built a strategic acreage position in the Utica Shale  strengthening our portfolio of high quality unconventional assets, leveraging our operating expertise and creating significant potential for future growth in reserves and production.  Appraisal activities on this acreage are planned to commence in the fourth quarter.
Yesterday, we also announced that we will proceed with the development of the Hess operated Tubular Bells Field in the Mississippi Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico.  The plan calls

for three subsea production wells and two water injection wells tied back to a third-party owned spar production facility.  Drilling is scheduled to begin in 2012 and initial production is expected in 2014, subject to the receipt of necessary government permits.  Annual net production is expected to peak at approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and net recoverable resources are estimated at more than 65 million barrels of oil equivalent.  The net cost of the development is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion.  Following government approval of the recent assignment of BPs interest, Hess will hold a 57.14 percent interest and Chevron will hold the remaining 42.86 percent interest.
With regard to deepwater exploration, the Stena DrillMAX drillship has been contracted and we currently plan to drill a minimum of three exploration wells on our 90 percent owned Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block in Ghana commencing in the first quarter of 2012.

In Indonesia, we spud the Andalan well on the Semai V block July 12.  We are currently drilling below 17,000 feet and expect to reach total depth of about 22,000 feet during the fourth quarter.  Hess has a 100 percent working interest in the block.
th
In Brunei, the operator of Block CA-1, in which Hess has a 13.5 percent interest, spud the Julong Centre well on September 1.  The well is expected to reach total depth in the fourth quarter and additional wells are planned in 2012.

Turning to Marketing and Refining, we reported a loss of $23 million for the third quarter of 2011.  Our share of the Hovensa refinerys losses was $36 million, which was an improvement over the year ago quarter as a result of stronger gasoline and distillate crack spreads.  While the refinery effectively broke even in July and August, a significant drop in gasoline refining margins in September contributed to the third quarter loss.

Marketing earnings of $41 million were comparable to last years third quarter.  In Retail Marketing, gasoline volumes on a per site basis and convenience store sales were both down nearly 2 percent  reflecting the weak economy.  In Energy Marketing, electricity sales volumes were up versus the year ago quarter while natural gas and fuel oil sales volumes were relatively flat.
Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first nine months of 2011 were approximately $5.2 billion.  For the full year, our capital and exploratory expenditures forecast has been increased to $7.2 billion from $6.2 billion.  The acquisitions of acreage in the Utica and an additional 4 percent interest in the Hess operated South Arne Field in the Danish sector of the North Sea account for the increase.
We are excited to have acquired a strategic position in the emerging Utica Shale play, which strengthens our portfolio of unconventional resources.  We remain committed to

maintaining a strong balance sheet to fund our future investment opportunities and profitably grow our reserves and production.
 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.

Exhibit 99(3)
 
HESS CORPORATION
THIRD QUARTER 2011 ANALYSTS' CONFERENCE CALL
 
 
Introduction
Hello everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare third quarter 2011 results to the second quarter.
Consolidated Results of Operations
The Corporation generated consolidated net income of $298 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with $607 million in the second quarter.  The third quarter results included net after-tax charges of $81 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods.
Exploration and Production
Exploration and Production had income of $422 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared with $747 million in the second quarter. Third quarter results included several items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods that were described earlier by John Hess. Excluding these items, the changes in the after-tax components of earnings are as follows:
Our E&P operations were underlifted in the quarter compared with production, resulting in decreased after-tax income of approximately $30 million.
 
Our E&P total production unit costs were approximately $39.35 per barrel in the third quarter. We estimate our total production unit costs will be approximately $39 per barrel in the fourth quarter.
 
The charge of $44 million for the additional 12% supplementary tax in the United Kingdom includes a provision of approximately $15 million representing the incremental tax on earnings from the effective date of March 24, 2011 through the end of the second quarter and a charge of $29 million to increase the United Kingdom deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet.  Excluding the impact of the items affecting comparability of earnings between periods the E&P effective income tax rate was 27% for the third quarter, primarily reflecting the mix of earnings, and 37% for the first nine months of 2011.
