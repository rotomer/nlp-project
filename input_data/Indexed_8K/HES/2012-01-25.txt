HESS REPORTS ESTIMATED RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011
Fourth Quarter Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) reported a net loss of $131 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with net income of $58 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity was as follows:
NEW YORK, January 25, 2012
--

Exploration and Production earnings were $527 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $420 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The Corporations average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $89.70 per barrel, up from $71.73 per barrel in the same quarter a year ago. The average worldwide natural gas selling price was $6.32 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2011, up from $5.30 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Fourth quarter oil and gas production was 367,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 420,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter a year ago, largely due to production interruptions and asset sales.  Fourth quarter 2011 results included higher exploration expenses reflecting total dry hole costs of $236 million ($143 million after-tax), primarily associated with two exploration wells on the Semai V Block, offshore Indonesia.
Oil and gas proved reserves were 1,573 million barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2011, compared with 1,537 million barrels at the end of 2010. During 2011, the Corporation added 203 million barrels of oil equivalent to proved reserves. These additions, which are subject to final review, replaced approximately 147 percent of the Corporations 2011 production, resulting in a reserve life of 11.4 years.
Marketing and Refining generated a loss of $561 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $261 million in the same period in 2010.  Refining operations incurred a loss of $598 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, including the HOVENSA L.L.C. shutdown charge discussed below, and a loss of $308 million in the fourth quarter a year ago.  Marketing earnings were $48 million compared with $37 million in the same quarter of 2010.  Trading activities generated a loss of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and income of $10 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
The following table reflects the total after-tax income (expense) of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:

Fourth quarter 2011 results included an after-tax charge of $525 million related to the Corporations investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. and the shutdown of the refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,138 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $1,478 million in the same quarter of 2010.  Capital and exploratory expenditures were $2,236 million, of which $2,185 million related to Exploration and Production operations.  Capital and exploratory expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $2,464 million, of which $2,438 million related to Exploration and Production operations.
At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $351 million compared with $1,608 million at December 31, 2010.  Total debt was $6,057 million at December 31, 2011 and $5,583 million at December 31, 2010.  The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2011 was 24.6 percent compared with 24.9 percent at the end of 2010.
Hess Corporation will review fourth quarter financial and operating results and other matters on a webcast at 10 a.m. today.  For details about the event, refer to the Investor Relations section of our website at .

Thank you Jay.  Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call.  I would like to review key achievements for 2011 and provide some guidance for 2012.  Greg Hill will then discuss our Exploration and Production business and John Rielly will go through our financial results.
 
Corporate net income for the full year 2011 was $1.7 billion.  Exploration and Production earned $2.7 billion and Marketing and Refining lost $584 million.  Compared to 2010, our results reflected lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes, weaker refining results, and the impact of higher crude oil selling prices.  Included in our fourth quarter 2011 financial results is an after-tax charge of $525 million related to the closure of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery, which was announced last week.
 
In 2012, our companys capital and exploratory expenditures are budgeted at $6.8 billion, with substantially all dedicated to

Exploration and Production.  Over the past several years, we have significantly increased our commitment to unconventionals to generate more predictable growth in reserves and production.  In 2012, we plan to invest $2.5 billion, or nearly 40 percent of our projected spend, in unconventionals.  In addition, we plan to invest $1.6 billion for production, $1.8 billion for developments and $800 million for exploration.
 
We expect to fund the majority of our 2012 capital program from internally generated cash flow and asset sales.  To protect our cash flow we have hedged 120 thousand barrels per day, or approximately 45 percent of our forecasted oil production, for the calendar year 2012 at an average Brent price of $107.70 per barrel.
In the fourth quarter we agreed to sell our 3 percent interest in the Snohvit LNG project in Norway to Statoil for $170 million.  This transaction will reduce our 2012 production by approximately 3 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day and is expected to close on January 31.

With regard to Exploration and Production, in 2011 we replaced 147 percent of production, at an FD&A cost of approximately $36 per barrel.  At year end our proved reserves stood at 1.573 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 11.4 years.  Including last years results, our five year average reserve replacement ratio is 153 percent and our average FD&A cost is about $23 per barrel of oil equivalent.
 
In 2011, our crude oil and natural gas production was 370 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, an 11 percent decrease compared to the 418 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day we averaged in 2010.  Most of last year's production issues were due to short term setbacks, including weather related delays in North Dakota, the temporary shut in of the Llano #3 well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, a fire at the Valhall Field in Norway and civil unrest in Libya.  We continue to make progress in restoring these lost production volumes.

In 2012, we forecast crude oil and natural gas production to average between 370 and 390 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.  This projection includes the sale of Snohvit, but excludes the impact of any other potential asset sales and any production that may result from the restoration of our operations in Libya.
Our sustainable long term growth target for production and reserves remains 3 to 5 percent per year.  However, if 2012 were used as a base, which includes some residual effects from the production issues we experienced in 2011, we would project growth through 2017 to be in the range of 4 to 7 percent per year.
Last year, we continued to grow our portfolio of unconventional resources.  In the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota, we generated strong growth throughout the second half of the year and exited 2011 at a peak net rate of approximately 50 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.  We maintain our 60 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day forecast for the Bakken in 2012.

We also plan to continue the appraisal of our acreage in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and the Utica Shale in Ohio.
 
Regarding developments, in the third quarter of 2011 we sanctioned the Tubular Bells project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.  Hess has a 57 percent interest in the field and is the operator.  In 2012, we will work with our partner Chevron to advance the project and we anticipate first production in 2014.
In terms of exploration, the Andalan No. 1 well on the Semai V Block in Indonesia encountered reservoir sands and hydrocarbons, but not in commercial quantities.  This well, along with a follow up well, were expensed in the fourth quarter.
With regard to Marketing and Refining, our full year 2011 financial results were lower than 2010.  Last week, HOVENSA, in which Hess has a 50 percent interest, announced that it will close the joint venture refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.  The refinery has commenced shutdown and will become an oil storage terminal.  Overall losses at the HOVENSA refinery have

totaled $1.3 billion in the past three years and were projected to continue.  These losses have been caused primarily by the global economic slowdown and the addition of new refining capacity in emerging markets.  In addition, the low price of natural gas in the United States put HOVENSA, an oil-fueled refinery, at a competitive disadvantage.  HOVENSA examined every strategic option to maximize value, but ultimately severe financial losses left no other choice but to close.
 
In Retail Marketing, while 2011 convenience store sales and average gasoline volumes per station were both down 2 percent, reflecting the weak economic environment, year over year earnings were higher.  Also, our Energy Marketing business delivered strong operating results, but earnings were lower than last year.
 
Our financial position remains strong.  Our debt to capitalization ratio at year end was 25 percent, essentially unchanged from year end 2010.
 
 
- 6 -
 
 
2011 was a difficult year operationally but important strategically.  With the closure of the HOVENSA refinery, we have completed our transition to being predominantly an exploration and production company.  Also, with the addition of our newly acquired acreage position in the Utica Shale, the company now has the critical mass for shale resources to make a significant contribution to our future production and reserve growth with lower risk than has been the case historically.  Our principal focus in 2012 will be to execute our investment opportunities to sustain profitable growth and create value for our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill.

Marketing and Refining
Marketing and Refining incurred a loss of $561 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $23 million in the third quarter.  Fourth quarter results include an after-tax charge of $525 million related to the announced shutdown of HOVENSAs refinery in St. Croix.  This charge includes estimates of the Corporations share of future funding commitments for preserving assets, severance and other costs related to the shutdown, of which approximately $400 million is expected to be funded in 2012.
Excluding the refinery shutdown charge, he Corporations share of HOVENSAs results of operations was a loss of $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $36 million in the third quarter.  Port Reading had a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and broke even in the third quarter.

Total debt was $6,057 million at December 31, 2011 and $5,583 million at December 31, 2010.  At year-end 2011, we had more than $3.8 billion available on our revolving credit facility.  The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2011 was 24.6% compared with 24.9% at the end of 2010.
2012 Guidance
 
Net Corporate expenses in 2012 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million.  We expect our 2012 after-tax interest expense to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million.
For full year 2012 unit costs, our E&P cash operating costs are expected to be in the range of 20.00 21.00 per barrel of oil equivalent produced. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses are expected to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel, for total production unit costs of $40.50 to $42.50.  We currently expect our E&P effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 40% for the full year of 2012. Both the unit cost and tax rate guidance exclude the impact of any Libyan operations.
