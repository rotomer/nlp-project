Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On March 7, 2012, the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the Committee) of Hess Corporation (the Company) approved, and the Board of Directors adopted, an amendment (the Amendment) to the Companys First Amended 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as so amended, the Second Amended 2008 Incentive Plan), subject to the requisite stockholder approval, to increase the number of shares of the Companys common stock that may be issued under the First Amended 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan by 8,000,000 shares. At the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 2, 2012 (the 2012 Annual Meeting), stockholders approved the Amendment.
 
Under the Second Amended 2008 Incentive Plan, a maximum of 29,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock will be available for delivery, plus up to 6,456,000 shares of common stock subject to outstanding options or other awards under the Companys Second Amended and Restated 1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan that are forfeited or are otherwise settled or terminated without a distribution of shares on or after December 31, 2011. The Second Amended 2008 Incentive Plan will continue in effect until all shares of common stock available under the Second Amended 2008 Incentive Plan are delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the Second Amended 2008 Incentive Plan is terminated earlier by the Board of Directors. However, no awards may be granted under the Second Amended 2008 Incentive Plan on or after May 7, 2018.
 
A brief summary of the Second Amended 2008 Incentive Plan is included under Proposal to Approve the Amendment of the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan to Increase the Number of Shares Available Under the Plan in the Companys 2012 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on March 23, 2012.
