HESS REPORTS ESTIMATED RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012
Second Quarter Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) reported net income of $549 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared with $607 million for the second quarter of 2011.  The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity was as follows:
NEW YORK, July 25, 2012
--
 
Exploration and Production earnings were $644 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $747 million in the second quarter of 2011.  The Corporations average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $86.86 per barrel, down from $97.20 per barrel in the same quarter a year ago.  The average worldwide natural gas
 
 
1
 
 
selling price of $5.94 per mcf in the second quarter of 2012 was comparable with the same quarter a year ago.  Second quarter oil and gas production was 429,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 372,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting an increase in production from the Bakken oil shale play and the resumption of operations in Libya.
 
Marketing and Refining generated earnings of $8 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with a loss of $39 million in the same period in 2011.  Marketing earnings were $18 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $28 million in the second quarter of 2011.  Refining operations generated income of $8 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with a loss of $44 million in the second quarter a year ago.  Trading activities generated a loss of $18 million in the second quarter of 2012 and a loss of $23 million in the second quarter of last year.
The following table reflects the total after-tax income (expense) of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:
Results for the second quarter of 2012 included an after-tax charge of $36 million for certain exploration properties in the Eagle Ford shale in the United States that are expected to be divested in an asset exchange with a joint venture partner.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,240 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $1,689 million in the same quarter of 2011.  Capital and exploratory expenditures were $2,078 million, of which $2,036 million related to Exploration and Production operations.  Capital and exploratory expenditures for the second quarter of 2011 were $1,490 million, of which $1,469 million related to Exploration and Production operations.
At June 30, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $409 million, compared with $351 million at December 31, 2011.  Total debt was $7,845 million at June 30, 2012 and $6,057 million at

Exhibit 99(2)
Thank you Jay and welcome to our second quarter conference call.  I will make a few brief comments after which Greg Hill will provide an update on our activities in the Bakken.  John Rielly will then review our financial results.
This conference call, at mid-year, is when we discuss our 2012 results and forecasts in more detail. 
 
Just as important, this quarter also marks a mid-point in a period of important change for Hess.  Before getting into the details of the quarter, I would like to reflect on this change for a moment as I think doing so will provide meaningful context to our current and expected future results.   
 
This change essentially began in 2009 and should be largely complete in 2014.  In that relatively short span of five years, Hess has all but exited the refining business with the closure of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery and will have shifted our
 
 
1
 
 
exploration and production growth strategy from one based primarily on high impact exploration to one combining lower risk unconventional development opportunities, such as the Bakken, along with exploitation of existing discoveries, like the North Malay Basin, and more focused and limited exposure to high impact exploration, such as Ghana and Ness Deep in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
 
This shift in E&P has required a substantial up-front increase in capital spend, largely related to the Bakken.  Approximately 35% of this years capital and exploratory expenditures are devoted to the Bakken, compared to 11% in 2009.  The majority of our total spend has been funded with cash flow from operations.  Any shortfall has been and is expected to be funded mostly, if not entirely, through asset sales, as we rebalance our oil and gas reserve and production portfolio in favor of lower risk, geographically more secure and higher return assets. 
 
 
2
 
 
At current oil prices, the gap between cash flow and capital expenditures should peak this year at about $3 billion, moderate substantially next year, and approach a balance in 2014.  Asset sales should be largely completed by year end 2013.  We expect that the reserve and production base established as a consequence of these actions will be lower than the levels likely to be achieved in 2012.  However, the profitability of those barrels on a per unit basis should be higher than is currently the case.
 
With the feedback gained each day through the execution of our strategy, we feel ever more confident that this portfolio reshaping is the right course for our company.  Certainly, there have been and will continue to be difficult learning experiences along the way, but we are convinced of the strategy, committed to its successful execution and believe that it will lead to improved financial performance.

With that as an introduction, we will now cover the details of the quarter.  Net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $549 million.  Compared to the year ago quarter, our earnings were positively impacted by higher crude oil sales volumes and improved Marketing and Refining results, but were negatively impacted by lower realized crude oil selling prices and higher operating costs in Exploration and Production.
Exploration and Production earned $644 million.  Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 429 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 15 percent increase over the year ago quarter.  Higher production from the Bakken in North Dakota, the Llano Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Libya was partially offset by natural field declines in Equatorial Guinea.
In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken averaged 55 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter compared to 25 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter, an increase of 120 percent.  For
 
 
4
 
 
the full year 2012, we now forecast net Bakken production to average between 54 and 58 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.  In April, we commenced operation of our crude oil rail loading facility and shipped an average of 29 thousand barrels per day during the quarter to higher value markets.
At the Llano Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where Hess has a 50 percent interest, a successful workover was performed on the Llano #3 well which had been shut-in for mechanical reasons since the first quarter of last year.  The well was brought back online in May, and in June net production averaged 13 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In Libya, net production averaged 22 thousand barrels per day in the second quarter.  In last years second quarter the fields were shut-in due to civil unrest.  Given the political uncertainty in Libya earlier in the year, we chose to exclude Libya from our original 2012 production forecast.  However, since
 
 
5
 
 
production has been restored, we will now include Libya in our revised production and financial forecasts.
At the Valhall Field in Norway, net production averaged 23 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter.  BP, the operator, has informed us that the field will be shut-in for approximately 90 days, compared to their original forecast of 30 days, which will result in 2012 net production averaging 15 to 20 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day versus our previous expectation of 20 to 25 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.  Major field redevelopment work is now expected to be completed by the end of this year and development drilling will resume in 2013.
As a consequence of these factors and the strong overall performance of our portfolio, we now forecast 2012 production for our company to average between 395 and 405 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day which includes the addition of approximately 20 thousand barrels per day from Libya, which
 
 
6
 
 
was excluded from our previous forecast of between 370 and 390 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In June, we signed agreements with PETRONAS to develop nine discovered natural gas fields in the North Malay Basin, located offshore Peninsular Malaysia and adjacent to Hess interests in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area.  This project is consistent with our strategy to invest in long life, low risk reserves with attractive financial returns and exploration upside.  Hess will have a 50 percent working interest and become operator of the project.  The project will require a net investment for Hess of approximately $250 million in 2012.  First production is forecast to commence in 2013 at a net rate of approximately 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and increase in 2015 to an estimated 125 million cubic feet per day.

With regard to exploration, in Ghana, Hess concluded drilling operations on the Hickory North well in June.  The well encountered approximately 100 net feet of gas condensate pay.    We recently completed drilling our Beech prospect, located 5 miles north of the Paradise location and are conducting wireline logging.  The Stena DrillMax drillship will next drill our Almond prospect, located 20 miles west of Hickory North.
 
Offshore Brunei, the Jagus East well on Block CA-1, in which Hess has a 13.5 percent interest, encountered hydrocarbons.  This well along with the previously announced Julong East discovery is being evaluated and additional exploration and appraisal drilling is planned in 2013.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, on June 12 we spud the Ness Deep well, located on Green Canyon 507.  This is a Miocene prospect in which Hess has a 50 percent working interest.  BHP holds the remaining 50 percent and is the
th
 
 
8
 
 
operator.  The well is anticipated to take approximately 160 days to drill.
Turning to Marketing and Refining, we reported net income of $8 million for the second quarter of 2012.  Refining generated earnings of $8 million versus a loss of $44 million in the year ago quarter, reflecting a positive contribution from our Port Reading facility in the second quarter and the shutdown of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery earlier this year.  Marketing earnings of $18 million included an $11 million after-tax charge for environmental liabilities, compared to $28 million in last years second quarter.  Retail marketing benefited from declining wholesale prices during the second quarter which resulted in improved fuel margins.  Gasoline volumes on a per site basis were down approximately 3 percent, while total convenience store sales were down nearly 6 percent versus last years second quarter, reflecting the continued weak economy.  
 
 
9
 
 
In Energy Marketing, natural gas and oil volumes were lower versus last year, while electricity volumes were higher.
Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first half of 2012 were $4.1 billion, substantially all of which were related to Exploration and Production.  For the full year 2012, our capital and exploratory expenditures forecast has been increased to $8.5 billion from $6.8 billion.  Over half of the increase is due to activities in the Bakken with the balance related to Valhall, Tubular Bells and our recently announced investment in the North Malay Basin.
Although our 2013 capital and exploratory budget will not be finalized until the end of the year, we plan to make significant reductions below 2012 levels and be more aligned with expected cash flow.
As I said previously, we expect that internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales will fund most if not all of
 
 
10
 
 
our 2012-2013 capital and exploratory expenditures.  Year to date we have announced asset sales totaling more than $850 million, which includes the sale of our interest in the Schiehallion Field in the United Kingdom to Shell for $503 million as well as the previously announced sale of our interests in the Snohvit Field in Norway and the Bittern Field in the United Kingdom.  Additional asset sales of $1 to $2 billion are well underway and details will be announced as soon as terms are finalized.  Further asset sales have been identified and are in early stages of divestiture.
I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill.

Introduction
Hello everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare second quarter 2012 results to the first quarter.
Consolidated Results of Operations
The Corporation generated consolidated net income of $549 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $545 million in the first quarter.  Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the Corporation had earnings of $585 million in the second quarter, compared with $509 million in the previous quarter.
Exploration and Production
Exploration and Production had income of $644 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $635 million in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2012, the Corporation and a joint venture partner agreed to exchange interests in properties in the Eagle Ford shale in the United States and the Paris Basin in France.  As a result, the Corporation recorded an after-tax charge of $36 million to reduce the carrying value of the exploration properties that are expected to be divested in the exchange. First quarter results included an after-tax gain of $36 million related to the sale of the Corporations interest in the Snohvit Field, offshore Norway.  Excluding these items, the changes in after-tax components of the results were as follows:
Our E&P operations were overlifted in the quarter, compared with production, resulting in increased after-tax income of approximately $25 million.
The E&P effective income tax rate for the second quarter of was 47%, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods.
2012
In July 2012, the government of the United Kingdom changed the supplementary income tax rate applicable to deductions for dismantlement expenditures from 32% to 20%, with an effective date of March 12, 2012.  As a result, we expect to record a one-time charge in the
 
 
- 1 -
 
 
 
third quarter of 2012 of approximately $100 million to increase the deferred tax liabilities related to asset retirement obligations in the United Kingdom.  For the full year of 2012, we expect our normalized E&P effective tax rate to be in the range of 44% to 48%.  This forecast reflects the resumption of operations in Libya.
Full year 2012 unit costs are now expected to be $39.00 to $41.00 per barrel of oil equivalent produced, down from our previous guidance of $40.50 to $42.50 per barrel. E&P cash operating costs are still expected to be in the range of $20.00 to $21.00 per barrel and depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses are now expected to be in the range of $19.00 to $20.00 per barrel.
Marketing and Refining
Marketing and Refining generated income of $8 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $11 million in the first quarter.  Marketing earnings were $18 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $22 million in the first quarter, principally reflecting seasonally lower energy marketing earnings and an after-tax increase in environmental liabilities of $11 million, partially offset by improved retail gasoline margins. In refining, Port Reading operations generated income of $8 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with a loss of $6 million in the first quarter reflecting higher margins. Trading activities generated a loss of $18 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with a loss of $5 million in the first quarter.
Corporate and Interest
Net Corporate expenses were $39 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $38 million in the first quarter.  After-tax interest expense was $64 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $63 million in the first quarter.
Consolidated Cash Flows
Turning to cash flow 
We had $409 million of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2012 and $351 million at December 31, 2011.  Total debt was $7,845 million at June 30, 2012 and $6,057 million at December 31, 2011.  The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at June 30, 2012 was 28.2%, compared with 24.6% at the end of 2011.
 
- 2 -
 
 
 
As John Hess mentioned, total full year capital spend is now expected to be approximately $8.5 billion. The increase is primarily in four areas. Greg Hill has just explained the increase in Bakken capital spending. The remaining drivers for the increase relate to the recently sanctioned project in the North Malay Basin which added $250 million, cost increases for the Valhall redevelopment project of $200 million, and accelerated spend of $100 million at the Tubular Bells deepwater development due to the early arrival of the rig.
We plan to fund most, if not all, of our capital program with cash flow from operations and anticipated proceeds from the asset sales previously mentioned by John Hess.  We are currently using our available credit facilities to fund our capital program until the asset sales are completed. At June 30, 2012, we have $2.2 billion of outstanding borrowings under available credit facilities with additional committed credit capacity of $4.3 billion.
This concludes my remarks.  We will be happy to answer any questions.  I will now turn the call over to the operator.
