Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. Simultaneously with the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K, Hans H. Miller, Senior Vice President, Development, Planning and Investor Relations, of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., sent the following notice to members of the investment community: To Members of the Financial Community: We would like to bring to your attention certain changes to our Investor Financial Supplement that will be shown in our fourth quarter and year-end earnings release scheduled for Monday, January 27, after the close of the markets. (The Company will review fourth quarter and year-end results in an analyst conference call scheduled for Tuesday, January 28, at 10:00 EST.) In light of the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent proposals regarding disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures, certain non-GAAP data that historically has been disclosed in the Company's Investor Financial Supplement ("IFS") will now be calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, using the most directly comparable financial measures. Specific examples of non-GAAP financial performance measures include operating income per share and adjusted operating income. The Company has also revised its financial ratio calculations for book value per share, debt to equity and debt to capitalization to use equity excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) rather than equity excluding unrealized gain/(loss). Note that these ratios will also be calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the IFS. We have provided three years of quarterly historical information calculated in accordance with GAAP on the attached spreadsheets and posted these changes on our website so that you can update your models accordingly. Best. /s/ Hans H. Miller
