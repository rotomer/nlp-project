Item 5. Other Events. This Current Report on Form 8-K is filed on behalf of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("The Hartford") to provide supplemental financial disclosure relating to the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2002. Specifically, this report provides historical underwriting ratios under United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") relating to certain of The Hartford's property & casualty segments and related reconciliation detail. GAAP Underwriting Ratios - ------------------------ In The Hartford's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, (the "2002 10-K") which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2003, the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section included five underwriting ratios for each of The Hartford's property & casualty segments, other than certain run-off operations. The five underwriting ratios are loss ratio, loss adjustment expense ratio, expense ratio, dividend ratio and combined ratio. Consistent with The Hartford's historical practice, the underwriting ratios were calculated based on statutorily prescribed insurance accounting standards. Two of the elements required by these standards in the calculation of these ratios are prepared differently under GAAP. In the future, in light of the SEC's recent promulgation of Regulation G pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), The Hartford will no longer report in its Exchange Act filings statutory underwriting ratios, and will instead report underwriting ratios based solely on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To aid investors in comparing The Hartford's future financial results with historical results, this report includes GAAP underwriting ratios for each of the applicable property & casualty segments for the twelve fiscal quarters in the period ended December 31, 2002. Reconciliation of Statutory Accounting Measures - ----------------------------------------------- The expense ratios and the expense component of the combined ratios set forth in the 2002 10-K were based on written premiums, which are calculated based on statutory accounting principles. In the 2002 10-K, each measure of written premium was reconciled to earned premium, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The statutory underwriting ratios set forth in the 2002 10-K also were based on statutory underwriting expenses, for which all policy acquisition costs were expensed as incurred. In contrast, a GAAP calculation of underwriting expenses requires that certain policy acquisition costs be capitalized when incurred and amortized over time. This report includes a reconciliation of the statutory underwriting expense measures underlying the 2002 10-K statutory underwriting ratios to the corresponding GAAP underwriting expense measures.
