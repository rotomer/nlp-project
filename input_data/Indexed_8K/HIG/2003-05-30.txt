Exhibit 1.1 THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. COMMON STOCK ($0.01 PAR VALUE PER SHARE) UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS May 19, 2003 To the Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement attached hereto as Annex I. Ladies and Gentlemen: From time to time The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements in the form of Annex I hereto (each, a "PRICING AGREEMENT") which incorporates by reference these Underwriting Agreement General Terms and Conditions (this "UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT"), with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "UNDERWRITERS" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain shares (the "SHARES") of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the "COMMON STOCK") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "FIRM SHARES"). If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Company may grant to the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of Shares, specified in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "OPTIONAL SHARES"). The Firm Shares and the Optional Shares, if any, which the Underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to Section 3 hereof are herein collectively called the "DESIGNATED SHARES". The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Shares shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto. 1. Particular sales of Designated Shares may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Shares, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Shares in the Pricing Agreement
relating thereto will act as representatives (the "REPRESENTATIVES"). The term "REPRESENTATIVES" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. The Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Shares or as an obligation of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Shares. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Shares and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Shares shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate number of the Designated Shares, the initial public offering price of such Designated Shares or the manner of determining such price, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Shares, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Shares, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the number of such Designated Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Firm and Optional Shares, if any, and payment therefor. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under any Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that: (a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-103915) in respect of the Designated Shares has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION"); such registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form (excluding exhibits to such registration statement, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in the registration statement) heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives, have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; other than a registration statement increasing the size of the offering (a "RULE 462(b) REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "ACT"), which became effective upon filing, no other document with respect to such registration statement or document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission (other than prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, each in the form heretofore delivered to the Representatives); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or 2
threatened by the Commission; any preliminary prospectus included in such registration statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act is hereinafter called a "PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS"; the various parts of such registration statement and the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in such registration statements, at the time such parts of the registration statements became effective, each as amended at the time such parts of the registration statements became effective, are hereinafter collectively called the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT"; the final prospectus relating to the Designated Shares, in the form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof, including any documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such filing, being hereinafter called the "PROSPECTUS"; any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable form under the Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), and incorporated by reference in such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any report of the Company filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact 3
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of Designated Shares through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Shares; (c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the applicable filing date, the date of the applicable Pricing Agreement and any applicable Time of Delivery (as detailed below) as to the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of Designated Shares through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Shares; (d) Except as described in or contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been any material adverse change in, or any adverse development which materially affects, the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole from the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; and, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been any change in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon the exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn outs of performance shares, upon conversions of convertible securities and upon exercises of stock purchase contracts, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or any material increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the business affairs, management, financial position, and stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; 4

Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Shares and authorization by the Representatives of the release of the Firm Shares, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Shares for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented. The Company may specify in the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Shares that the Company thereby grants to the Underwriters the right (an "OVERALLOTMENT OPTION") to purchase at their election up to a certain number of Optional Shares, on the terms set forth in such Pricing Agreement, for the sole purpose of covering sales of Shares in excess of the number of Firm Shares. Any such election to purchase Optional Shares may be exercised by written notice from the Representatives to the Company, given within a period specified in the Pricing Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Shares to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Shares are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof) or, unless the Representatives and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Pricing Agreement. The number of Optional Shares to be added to the number of Firm Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Shares shall be, in each case, the number of Optional Shares which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been allocated to such Underwriter; provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the number of Optional Shares to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Shares which the number of Firm Shares to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares (rounded as the Representatives may determine to the nearest 100 shares). The total number of Designated Shares to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement plus the aggregate number of Optional Shares which the Underwriters elect to purchase. 4. Certificates for the Designated Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in the form specified in such Pricing Agreement (including, if so specified, in uncertificated form), and in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the 7
Representatives for the account of each such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives at least forty-eight hours in advance as specified in such Pricing Agreement, (i) with respect to the Firm Shares, all in the manner and at the place and time and date specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "FIRST TIME OF DELIVERY", and (ii) with respect to the Optional Shares, if any, in the manner and at the time and date specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Shares, or at such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date, if not the First Time of Delivery, herein called the "SECOND TIME OF DELIVERY". Each such time and date for delivery is herein called a "TIME OF DELIVERY". For purposes of this Agreement, "NEW YORK BUSINESS DAY" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of the Designated Shares: (a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Shares in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the applicable Designated Shares, or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares and prior to the Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares which shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Designated Shares promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement after such Time of Delivery and furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Designated Shares, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the 8
issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Designated Shares, of the suspension of the qualification of such Designated Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Designated Shares or suspending any such qualification, to promptly use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Designated Shares for offering and sale under the insurance and securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Designated Shares, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction; and provided further that the Company shall not be required to qualify the Designated Shares in any jurisdiction if such qualification would result in any obligation on the part of the Company to make filings with any governmental entity in such jurisdiction after the completion of the offering; (c) Prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day next succeeding the date of the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Shares and from time to time, to furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Designated Shares and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the 9
Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; (d) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158); (e) Without the prior written consent of each of the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, it will not, during the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for the Designated Shares and continuing to and including the date 90 days after the date of the Prospectus Supplement (the "LOCK-UP PERIOD"), (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (a) the sale of any Designated Shares to the Underwriters hereunder, (b) transactions relating to the Common Stock or other securities acquired in open market transactions after the completion of the public offering by the several Underwriters of the Designated Shares, (c) any shares of capital stock issued by the Company upon the exercise of an option, warrant or right or the conversion or exercise of a security outstanding on the date hereof; (d) any capital stock issued or options to purchase shares of Common Stock granted pursuant to employment benefit plans of the Company or other employee or non-employee director compensation arrangements or agreements in existence as of the date of the Prospectus; (e) any capital stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for capital stock of the Company as consideration for any acquisition by the Company, provided that in any such transaction not registered under the Act in which the recipients would receive such capital stock or securities during the Lock-up Period, the recipients of such capital stock or securities agree in writing not to sell or otherwise transfer such capital stock or securities during the Lock-up Period; or (f) the Equity Units, including any shares of Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Equity Units, 10
to be sold by the Company to the several underwriters (the "EQUITY UNITS UNDERWRITERS") named in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement relating to the Equity Units, dated May 19, 2003, between the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and UBS Warburg LLC, acting as representatives of the Equity Units Underwriters; and (f) If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Company shall file a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement with the Commission in compliance with Rule 462(b) by 10:00 p.m., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement, and the Company shall either (a) by the time of filing pay to the Commission the filing fee for the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or (b) at the time of filing submit with the 462(b) Registration Statement the certification required under Rule 111(b) under the Act. 6. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Designated Shares under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, any Pricing Agreement, any Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Designated Shares; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Designated Shares for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey(s); (iv) the cost of preparing certificates for the Designated Shares; (v) the cost and charges of any transfer agent or registrar or dividend disbursing agent; and (vi) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 8 and 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Designated Shares by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make. 7.

(ii) The Company's share capital is as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company (including the Designated Shares being delivered at such Time of Delivery) have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; and the Designated Shares conform to the description thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; (iii) Except as described in the Prospectus, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending, nor to such counsel's best knowledge is there any action, suit or proceeding threatened, which might reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, or which is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement; (iv) The Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; (v) The issue and sale of the Designated Shares and the compliance by the Company with the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended By-Laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; (vi) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue or sale of the Designated Shares or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Pricing Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Exchange Act, and any such consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification as may be required under state securities or Blue 13
Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Shares by the Underwriters; (vii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and based upon specified participation of such counsel in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial data included in any of the documents mentioned in this clause and that such counsel may state that he has not independently verified factual statements in any such document; (viii) The Designated Shares have been duly registered under the Exchange Act; (ix) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and based upon specified participation of such counsel in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, such counsel has no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration 14
Statement or any further amendment thereto on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; it being understood that such counsel may state that he has not independently verified factual statements in the Prospectus (or any such amendment or supplement); In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that he expresses no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States and in respect of matters of fact such counsel may rely upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries; provided that such counsel shall state he believes that both you and he are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates and copies of such opinions and certificates are made available to you; 15
(e) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for the Designated Shares at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Shares and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, Deloitte and Touche LLP, the independent accountants of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of the Pricing Agreement and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, as to such matters ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (f) (i) Except as described in or contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been any material adverse change in, or any adverse development which materially affects, the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, from the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares; and (ii) except as contemplated in the Prospectus, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Shares; (g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission 16
for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; (h) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange (the "EXCHANGE"); (ii) a material suspension or limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) a material adverse change in the financial markets, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Shares; (i) The Shares being delivered at each Time of Delivery shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the Exchange; and (j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Shares a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged 17
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II. (b) Each Underwriter of Designated Shares will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under 18
subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a 19
material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Shares in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Shares which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Shares, as the case may be, then the Company shall 20
be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Shares, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Shares, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "UNDERWRITER" as used in the Pricing Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Shares. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Designated Shares which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Designated Shares to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Designated Shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Designated Shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Designated Shares which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Designated Shares as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be 21
borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to such Pricing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares. 11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated due to the failure of Davis Polk & Wardwell to deliver its opinion to the Representatives pursuant to Section 7(b) or pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Shares set forth in such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than in respect of a breach of the Pricing Agreement by any Underwriter of Designated Shares covered by such Pricing Agreement), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Shares, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Shares except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof. 12. In all dealings under the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Shares, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties thereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any such Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in such Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: General Counsel; 22
provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters and the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks in the City of New York are authorized or required to close. 15. These Underwriting Agreement General Terms and Conditions and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 16. The Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 23

Exhibit 1.2 THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. $250,000,000 2.375% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 1, 2006 UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS May 19, 2003 To the Underwriters named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement. Ladies and Gentlemen: From time to time The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements in the form of Annex I hereto (each, a "PRICING AGREEMENT") which incorporates by reference these Underwriting Agreement General Terms and Conditions (this "UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT"), with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "UNDERWRITERS" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "SECURITIES") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "DESIGNATED SECURITIES"). The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the indenture (the "INDENTURE") identified in such Pricing Agreement. 1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "REPRESENTATIVES"). The term "REPRESENTATIVES" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter who acts without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. The Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as

any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II. (b) Each Underwriter of Designated Securities will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information 18
furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits 19
referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the 20
Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "UNDERWRITER" as used in the Pricing Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which 21
such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to such Pricing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities. 11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated due to the failure of Davis Polk & Wardwell to deliver its opinion to the Representatives pursuant to Section 7(b) or pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities governed by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than in respect of a breach of the Pricing Agreement by any Underwriter of Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of 22
such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof. 12. In all dealings under the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Securities, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties thereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any such Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in such Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: General Counsel; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters and the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks in the City of New York are authorized or required to close. 15. These Underwriting Agreement General Terms and Conditions and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 23
16. The Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 24

Exhibit 1.3 THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. 12,000,000 NORMAL UNITS UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS May 19, 2003 To the Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement attached hereto as Annex I. Ladies and Gentlemen: From time to time The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements in the form of Annex I hereto (each, a "PRICING AGREEMENT") which incorporates by reference these Underwriting Agreement General Terms and Conditions (this "UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT"), with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "UNDERWRITERS" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain Normal Units (as defined below) of the Company specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "FIRM SECURITIES"). If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Company may grant to the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of Normal Units, specified in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "OPTIONAL SECURITIES"). The Firm Securities and the Optional Securities, if any, which the Underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to Section 3 hereof are herein collectively called the "DESIGNATED SECURITIES". Each "NORMAL UNIT" is a unit with a stated amount of $50 (the "STATED AMOUNT") comprised of (a) a stock purchase contract (a "PURCHASE CONTRACT", and collectively with each other Purchase Contract, the "PURCHASE CONTRACTS") under which (i) the holder of a Normal Unit (a "HOLDER", and collectively with other Holders of Normal Units, the "HOLDERS") will purchase from the Company on August 16, 2006 (the "SETTLEMENT DATE"), for $50 per Normal Unit, a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "COMMON STOCK"), as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below) and (ii) the Company will pay quarterly contract adjustment payments at the rate of 4.44% of the Stated Amount per year, and (b) a 1/20th undivided beneficial
ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's Senior Notes due August 16, 2008. Each such ownership interest is referred to herein as a "SENIOR NOTE OWNERSHIP INTEREST" and collectively with each other Senior Note Ownership Interest, the "SENIOR NOTE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS" and such Senior Notes due August 16, 2008 are referred to herein as the "SENIOR NOTES". In accordance with the terms of a Purchase Contract Agreement (the "PURCHASE Agreement") to be dated as of the Time of Delivery (as defined below) between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Purchase Contract Agent (the "PURCHASE CONTRACT AGENT"), pursuant to which the Purchase Contracts will be issued, the holders of the Normal Units will pledge all of their respective title, right and interest in and to the Senior Note Ownership Interests constituting part of the Normal Units to JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Collateral Agent (the "COLLATERAL AGENT"), pursuant to a Pledge Agreement (the "PLEDGE AGREEMENT") to be dated as of the Time of Delivery between the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent, to secure the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts. The Purchase Agreement and the Pledge Agreement are herein collectively referred to as the "EQUITY UNIT AGREEMENTS." The Senior Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture (the "BASE INDENTURE"), dated as of October 20, 1995 between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as indenture trustee (the "TRUSTEE"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 27, 2000 (the "FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE"), the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 13, 2002 (the "SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE") and the Third Supplemental Indenture to be dated as of the Time of Delivery between the Company and the Trustee (the "THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE"). The Base Indenture, as so amended or supplemented, is herein referred to as the "INDENTURE." Pursuant to a Remarketing Agreement (the "REMARKETING AGREEMENT") to be dated as of the Time of Delivery between the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Remarketing Agent (as defined in the Remarketing Agreement, the "REMARKETING AGENT"), the Remarketing Agent, will remarket the Senior Notes, subject to the terms and condition set forth therein. The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto. 1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Normal Units in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "REPRESENTATIVES"). The term "REPRESENTATIVES" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. The 2
Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Normal Units or as an obligation of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Normal Units. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Normal Units and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Normal Units shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate number of the Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities or the manner of determining such price, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the number of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to such Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of, and payment for, the Firm Securities and Optional Securities, if any. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under any Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that: (a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-103915) in respect of certain securities of the Company, including the Designated Securities, the Purchase Contracts, and the Senior Notes, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION"); such registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form (excluding exhibits to such registration statement, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in the registration statement) heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives, have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; other than a registration statement increasing the size of the offering (a "RULE 462(b) REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "ACT"), which became effective upon filing, no other document with respect to such registration statement or document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission (other than prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, each in the form heretofore delivered to the Representatives); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission; any preliminary prospectus included in such registration statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 3
424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act is hereinafter called a "PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS"; the various parts of such registration statement and the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in such registration statements at the time such parts of the registration statements became effective, each as amended at the time such parts of the registration statements became effective, are hereinafter collectively called the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT"; the final prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, in the form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof, including any documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such filing, being hereinafter called the "PROSPECTUS"; any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable form under the Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), and incorporated by reference in such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any report of the Company filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an 4

Sections 101-1330, as amended) should not substantively limit the provisions of Sections 3.15 and 5.06 of the Purchase Agreement or Section 5.04 of the Pledge Agreement that require termination of the Purchase Contracts and release of the Collateral Agent's security interest in (1) the applicable Senior Note Ownership Interests, (2) the Treasury Securities or (3) the applicable ownership interest of the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, and the transfer of such securities to the Purchase Contract Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Equity Units (as defined in the Prospectus); provided further, however, the Company makes no representation as to whether a court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction might issue a temporary restraining order or provide other interim relief that would delay the exercise of such termination right for a period of time pending final adjudication of any challenge to the exercise of such right during a bankruptcy case involving the Company; and the Equity Units will conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented with respect to such Designated Securities. 6

(i) Except as described in the Prospectus, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending, nor to the knowledge of the Company, is there 7

Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives of the release of the Firm Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented. The Company may specify in the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities that the Company thereby grants to the Underwriters the right (an "OVERALLOTMENT OPTION") to purchase at their election a certain number of Optional Securities, on the terms set forth in such Pricing Agreement, for the sole purpose of covering sales of Normal Units in excess of the number of Firm Securities. Any such election to purchase Optional Securities may be exercised by written notice from the Representatives to the Company, given within a period specified in the Pricing Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Securities to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Securities are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof) or, unless the Representatives and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Pricing Agreement. The number of Optional Securities to be added to the number of Firm Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities shall be, in each case, the number of Optional Securities which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been allocated to such Underwriter; provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the number of Optional Securities to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Securities which the number of Firm Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate number of Firm Securities (rounded as the Representatives may determine to the nearest Normal Unit). The total number of Designated Securities to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Firm Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement plus the aggregate number of Optional Securities which the Underwriters elect to purchase. 4. Certificates for the Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in the form 10
specified in such Pricing Agreement, (including, if so specified, in global form) and in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of each such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same day) funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives at least forty-eight hours in advance as specified in such Pricing Agreement, (i) with respect to the Firm Securities, all in the manner and at the place and time and date specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "FIRST TIME OF DELIVERY", and (ii) with respect to the Optional Securities, if any, in the manner and at the time and date specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Securities, or at such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date, if not the First Time of Delivery, herein called the "SECOND TIME OF DELIVERY". Each such time and date for delivery is herein called a "TIME OF DELIVERY". For purposes of this Agreement, "NEW YORK BUSINESS DAY" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities: (a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the applicable Designated Securities, or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and prior to the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities which shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Designated Securities promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement after such Time of Delivery and furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Designated Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, 11
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of such Designated Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Designated Securities or suspending any such qualification, to promptly use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Designated Securities for offering and sale under the insurance and securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Designated Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction; and provided further that the Company shall not be required to qualify the Designated Securities in any jurisdiction if such qualification would result in any obligation on the part of the Company to make filings with any governmental entity in such jurisdiction after the completion of the offering; (c) Prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day next succeeding the date of the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Securities and from time to time, to furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Designated Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act, to notify the 12
Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; (d) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158); and (e) Without the prior written consent of each of the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, it will not, during the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for the Designated Securities and continuing to and including the date 90 days after the date of the Prospectus Supplement (the "LOCK-UP PERIOD"), (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Equity Units, Purchase Contracts or shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Equity Units, Purchase Contracts or shares of Common Stock or (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Equity Units, Purchase Contracts or shares of Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Equity Units, Purchase Contracts or shares of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (a) the sale of any Designated Securities to the Underwriters hereunder, (b) transactions relating to the Company's Common Stock or other securities acquired in open market transactions after the completion of the public offering by the several Underwriters of the Designated Securities, (c) any shares of capital stock upon the exercise of an option, warrant or right or the conversion or exercise of a security outstanding on the date hereof, (d) any capital stock issued or options to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock granted pursuant to employment benefit plans of the Company or other employee or non-employee director compensation arrangements or agreements in existence as of the date of the Prospectus, (e) any capital stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for capital stock of the Company as consideration for any acquisition by the Company, provided that in any such transaction not registered under the Act in which the recipients would 13
receive such capital stock or securities during the Lock-up Period, the recipients of such capital stock or securities agree in writing not to sell or otherwise transfer such capital stock or securities during the Lock-up Period, (f) any shares of Common Stock of the Company to be issued in connection with the Stripped Units (as defined in the Prospectus) or the Normal Units to be created or recreated upon substitution of pledged securities or issuable upon settlement of the Stripped Units or Normal Units, or (g) the sale of shares of Common Stock to be sold by the Company to the several underwriters (the "COMMON STOCK UNDERWRITERS") named in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement relating to such shares of Common Stock, dated May 19, 2003, between the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citibank Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, acting as representatives of the Common Stock Underwriters.

such counsel shall state he believes that both you and he are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates and copies of such opinions and certificates are made available to you; (e) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for the Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, Deloitte and Touche LLP, the independent accountants of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of the Pricing Agreement and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, as to such matters ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (f) (i) Except as described in or contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been any material adverse change in, or any adverse development which materially affects, the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, from the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities; and (ii) except as contemplated in the Prospectus, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn outs of performance securities and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or long term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities; 19
(g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; (h) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the Exchange; (ii) a material suspension or limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) a material adverse change in the financial markets, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities; (i) The Designated Securities being delivered at each Time of Delivery and the shares of Common Stock to be issued and sold by the Company pursuant to the Purchase Contracts, shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the Exchange; and (j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such 20
Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II. (b) Each Underwriter of Designated Securities will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified 21
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions 22
received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within 23
thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "UNDERWRITER" as used in the Pricing Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of the Designated Securities to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate number of the Designated Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement 24
relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to such Pricing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities. 11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated due to the failure of Davis Polk & Wardwell to deliver its opinion to the Representatives pursuant to Section 7(b) or pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities set forth in such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than in respect of a breach of the Pricing Agreement by any Underwriter of Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof. 12. In all dealings under the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Securities, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties thereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any such Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in such Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the 25
address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: General Counsel; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters and the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks in the City of New York are authorized or required to close. 15. These Underwriting Agreement General Terms and Conditions and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 16. The Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 26

ANNEX II FORM OF OPINION OF DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 7(c) OF THE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 1. The shares of Common Stock to be issued and sold by the Company pursuant to the Purchase Contracts have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 2. The Purchase Agreement and the Pledge Agreement have each been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and, assuming each such agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the other parties thereto, each is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity); provided, however, that upon the occurrence of a Termination Event (as defined in the Purchase Contract), the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Sections 101-1330, as amended) should not substantively limit the provisions of Sections 3.15 and 5.06 of the Purchase Agreement or Section 5.04 of the Pledge Agreement that require termination of the Purchase Contracts and release of the Collateral Agent's security interest in (1) the Senior Notes, (2) the Treasury Securities (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or (3) the applicable ownership interest of the Treasury Portfolio (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), as applicable, and the transfer of such securities to the Purchase Contract Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Equity Security Units; provided further, however, that no opinion is expressed as to whether a court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction might issue a temporary restraining order or provide other interim relief that would delay the exercise of such termination right for a period of time pending final adjudication of any challenge to the exercise of such right during a bankruptcy case involving the Company. 3. The Normal Units have been duly authorized by the Company and when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement and delivered against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement, will be entitled to the benefits of the Purchase Agreement and will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles
of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity); provided, however, that upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Sections 101-1330, as amended) should not substantively limit the provisions of Sections 3.15 and 5.06 of the Purchase Agreement or Section 5.04 of the Pledge Agreement that require termination of the Purchase Contracts and release of the Collateral Agent's security interest in (1) the Senior Notes, (2) the Treasury Securities or (3) the applicable ownership interest of the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, and the transfer of such securities to the Purchase Contract Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Normal Units; provided further, however, that no opinion is expressed as to whether a court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction might issue a temporary restraining order or provide other interim relief that would delay the exercise of such termination right for a period of time pending final adjudication of any challenge to the exercise of such right during a bankruptcy case involving the Company; and the Equity Security Units conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented. 4.

The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended; the Indenture (including the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, the Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity). 6.

(a) The Senior Notes will bear interest initially at the rate of 2.56% per year (the "COUPON RATE") from the original date of issuance through and including the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the day immediately preceding any Reset Effective Date. In the event of a Successful Remarketing of the Senior Notes, the Coupon Rate may be reset by the Remarketing Agent at the appropriate Reset Rate with effect from the Reset Effective Date, as set forth under Section 8.03. If the Coupon Rate is so reset, the Senior Notes will bear interest at the Reset Rate from the Reset Effective Date until the principal thereof and interest thereon is paid or duly made available for payment.

Interest on the Senior Notes shall accrue from May 23, 2003. (c) The amount of interest payable for any full quarterly period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and, for any period less than a month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. In the event that any scheduled Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such 8
Interest Payment Date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next calendar year, then such payment will be made on the preceding Business Day. Section 2.06. No Defeasance. The provisions of Section 403 of the Base Indenture shall not apply to the Senior Notes. Section 2.07. No Sinking Fund. The Senior Notes are not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund. ARTICLE 3 REDEMPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES Section 3.01. Special Event Redemption. If a Special Event shall occur and be continuing, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, on any Interest Payment Date prior to the earlier of the date of a Successful Remarketing or the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, at a price per Senior Note equal to the Redemption Price, payable on the date of redemption (the "SPECIAL EVENT REDEMPTION DATE") to the Holders of the Senior Notes; provided that the installment of interest whose Stated Maturity is on the Special Event Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of the Senior Notes, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Date. If the Company so elects to redeem the Senior Notes, the Company shall appoint the Quotation Agent to assist the Company in determining the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price. Notice of any Special Event Redemption will be mailed by the Company (with a copy to the Trustee) at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Special Event Redemption Date to each registered Holder of the Senior Notes at its registered address. In addition, the Company shall notify the Collateral Agent in writing that a Special Event has occurred and that the Company intends to redeem the Senior Notes on the Special Event Redemption Date. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Special Event Redemption Date, (a) interest shall cease to accrue on the Senior Notes, (b) the Senior Notes shall become due and payable at the Redemption Price, and (c) the Senior Notes shall be void and all rights of the Holders in respect of the Senior Notes shall terminate and lapse (other than the right to receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of such Senior Notes but without interest on such Redemption Price). Following the notice of a Special Event Redemption, neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be required to register the transfer of or exchange the Senior Notes to be redeemed. 9
Section 3.02. Redemption Procedures. On or prior to the Special Event Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Special Event Redemption Date, the aggregate Redemption Price for all outstanding Senior Notes.

In the case of a Failed Third Remarketing and unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, on the Final Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Senior Notes at a price (the "FINAL REMARKETING PRICE") equal to approximately 100.50% (or, if the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket the Remarketed Senior Notes at such rate, at a rate below 100.50% in the discretion of the Remarketing Agent, but in no event less than 100%, net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and expenses) of the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. It is understood and agreed that Remarketing on any Remarketing Date will be considered successful and no further attempts will be made if the resulting proceeds are at least 100% (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and expenses) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and the Separate Senior Note Purchase Price, in the case of a Remarketing other than the Final Remarketing, or 100% (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and expenses) of the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes in 13
the case of the Final Remarketing and such Remarketing is settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement. Section 8.03. Reset Rate. (a) In connection with each Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall determine the Reset Rate (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (0.001) of one percent per annum) that the Remarketed Senior Notes should bear in order to have an aggregate market value equal to the Remarketing Price or the Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, and that in the sole reasonable discretion of the Remarketing Agent will enable it to remarket all of the Remarketed Senior Notes at the Remarketing Price or Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, in such Remarketing. (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Reset Rate shall in no event exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law and the Remarketing Agent shall have no obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Senior Notes and they shall rely solely upon written notice from the Company (which the Company agrees to provide prior to the eighth Business Day before the Initial Remarketing Date) as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate. (c) In the event of a Failed Remarketing or if there are no Pledged Senior Notes and none of the holders of the Separate Senior Notes elect to have their Senior Notes remarketed in any Remarketing, the applicable interest rate on the Senior Notes will not be reset and will continue to be the Coupon Rate. (d) In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Coupon Rate shall be reset at the Reset Rate as determined by the Remarketing Agent under the Remarketing Agreement. Section 8.04. Failed Remarketing. (a) If, by 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on any Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket all of the Remarketed Senior Notes at the Remarketing Price or the Final Remarketing Price, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof and the Remarketing Agreement or any such Remarketing is not settled in accordance with the terms of the Remarketing Agreement for any reason, a Failed Remarketing shall be deemed to have occurred, and the Remarketing Agent shall advise, by telephone the Depositary, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company, and return the Remarketed Senior Notes to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. 14
(b) The Company shall cause a notice of such Failed Remarketing to be published in a daily newspaper in the English language of general circulation in The City of New York, which is expected to be The Wall Street Journal. Section 8.05. Put Right. If there has not been a Successful Remarketing prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the holders of Separate Senior Notes will have the right (the "PUT RIGHT") to require the Company to purchase their Senior Notes on September 30, 2006 (the "EXERCISE DATE") upon a notice to the Trustee on or prior to the fifth Business Day prior to the Exercise Date, at a price per Senior Note equal to the principal amount of the Senior Note plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the Exercise Date (the "PUT PRICE"). If there has not been a Successful Remarketing prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Company shall notify, not more than ten (10) days after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Beneficial Owners of the Separate Senior Notes of the procedures to be followed if any Holder elects to exercise its Put Right. Section 8.06. Additional Event of Default. In addition to the events listed as Events of Default in Section 501 of the Base Indenture, it shall be an additional Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes, if the Company defaults in the payment of the Put Price with respect to any Separate Senior Note following the exercise of the Put Right by any Holder of Separate Senior Notes in accordance with Section 8.05. ARTICLE 9 TAX TREATMENT Section 9.01. Tax Treatment. The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a Normal Unit or a Separate Senior Note, each Holder of an Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes and each Holder of a Separate Senior Note will be deemed to have agreed (1) for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes to treat the acquisition of a Normal Unit as the acquisition of an Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes and the Purchase Contract constituting the Normal Unit and (2) to treat the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes and each Separate Senior Note, as the case may be, as indebtedness for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes.

SECTION 1.06. Notice to Holders; Waiver. Where this Agreement provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at its address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Purchase Contract Agent, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Purchase Contract Agent shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. SECTION 1.07. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 1.08. Successors and Assigns.

SECTION 1.10. Benefits of Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in the Units, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and, to the extent provided hereby, the Holders, any benefits or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement. The Holders from time to time shall be beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be 19
bound by all of the terms and conditions hereof and of the Units evidenced by their Certificates by their acceptance of delivery of such Certificates. SECTION 1.11. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Units shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of law provisions thereof. SECTION 1.12. Legal Holidays. In any case where any Payment Date shall not be a Business Day (notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Units), Contract Adjustment Payments or other distributions shall not be paid on such date, but Contract Adjustment Payments or such other distributions shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day, unless such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, in which case such Contract Adjustment Payments or other distributions shall be paid on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such scheduled Payment Date; provided that no interest shall accrue or be payable by the Company or to any Holder in respect of such payment or distribution for the period from and after any such scheduled Payment Date. In any case where the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or any Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date shall not be a Business Day (notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Units), Purchase Contracts shall not be performed and Early Settlement and Cash Merger Early Settlement shall not be effected on such date, but Purchase Contracts shall be performed or Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement shall be effected, as applicable, on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as applicable. SECTION 1.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts by the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

A copy of this Agreement shall be available at all reasonable times during normal business hours at the Corporate Trust Office for inspection by any Holder or Beneficial Owner. SECTION 1.15. Appointment of Financial Institution as Agent for the Company. 20
The Company may appoint a financial institution (which may be the Collateral Agent) to act as its agent in performing its obligations and in accepting and enforcing performance of the obligations of the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders, under this Agreement and the Purchase Contracts, by giving notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 1.05 hereof. Any such appointment shall not relieve the Company in any way from its obligations hereunder. SECTION 1.16. No Waiver. No failure on the part of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. ARTICLE 2 CERTIFICATE FORMS SECTION 2.01. Forms of Certificates Generally. The Certificates (including the form of Purchase Contract forming part of each Unit evidenced thereby) shall be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto (in the case of Certificates evidencing Normal Units) or Exhibit B hereto (in the case of Certificates evidencing Stripped Units), with such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed or engraved thereon as may be required by the rules of any securities exchange on which the Units are listed or any depositary therefor, or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers of the Company executing such Certificates, as evidenced by their execution of the Certificates. The definitive Certificates shall be produced in any manner as determined by the officers of the Company executing the Units evidenced by such Certificates, consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, as evidenced by their execution thereof. Every Global Certificate authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered hereunder shall bear a legend in substantially the following form: "THIS CERTIFICATE IS A GLOBAL CERTIFICATE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PURCHASE CONTRACT AGREEMENT HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO., AS NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION (THE 21

UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REQUESTED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN." SECTION 2.02. Form of Purchase Contract Agent's Certificate of Authentication. The form of the Purchase Contract Agent's certificate of authentication of the Units shall be in substantially the form set forth on the form of the applicable Certificates. ARTICLE 3 THE UNITS SECTION 3.01. Amount; Form and Denominations. The aggregate number of Units evidenced by Certificates authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered hereunder is limited to 12,000,000 (or 13,800,000 if the over-allotment option granted to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement is exercised in full), except for Certificates authenticated, executed and delivered upon registration of transfer of, in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Certificates pursuant to Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.09, 3.10, 3.13, 3.14 or 8.05. The Certificates shall be issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Normal Unit or Stripped Unit and any integral multiple thereof. 22
SECTION 3.02. Rights and Obligations Evidenced by the Certificates. Each Normal Units Certificate shall evidence the number of Normal Units specified therein, with each such Normal Unit representing (1) the ownership by the Holder thereof of the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge of such Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or such Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as the case may be, by such Holder pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (2) the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and the Company under one Purchase Contract. The Purchase Contract Agent is hereby authorized, as attorney-in-fact for, and on behalf of, the Holder of each Normal Unit, to pledge, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes and the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), if any, forming a part of such Normal Unit, to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company, and to grant to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, a security interest in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes and the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), if any, and in the Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes to secure the obligation of the Holder under each Purchase Contract to purchase shares of Common Stock. Upon the formation of a Stripped Unit pursuant to Section 3.13, each Stripped Unit Certificate shall evidence the number of Stripped Units specified therein, with each such Stripped Unit representing (1) the ownership by the Holder thereof of a 1/20 undivided beneficial interest in a Treasury Security with a principal amount equal to $1,000, subject to the Pledge of such interest by such Holder pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (2) the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and the Company under one Purchase Contract. The Purchase Contract Agent is hereby authorized, as attorney-in-fact for, and on behalf of, the Holder of each Stripped Unit, to pledge, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, such Holder's interest in the Treasury Security forming a part of such Stripped Unit to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, and to grant to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, a security interest in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Treasury Security to secure the obligation of the Holder under each Purchase Contract to purchase shares of Common Stock. Prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under each Purchase Contract, such Purchase Contracts shall not entitle the Holder of a Unit to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent or to receive notice as a shareholder in respect of the meetings of shareholders or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter, or any other rights whatsoever as a shareholder of the Company. SECTION 3.03. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. 23
Subject to the provisions of Sections 3.13 and 3.14 hereof, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and at any time and from time to time thereafter, the Company may deliver Certificates executed by the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for authentication, execution on behalf of the Holders and delivery, together with its Issuer Order for authentication of such Certificates, and the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with such Issuer Order shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holders and deliver such Certificates. The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board of Directors, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, its Treasurer or one of its Vice Presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Certificates may be manual or facsimile. Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of such Certificates. No Purchase Contract evidenced by a Certificate shall be valid until such Certificate has been executed on behalf of the Holder by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Purchase Contract Agent, as such Holder's attorney-in-fact. Such signature by an authorized officer of the Purchase Contract Agent shall be conclusive evidence that the Holder of such Certificate has entered into the Purchase Contracts evidenced by such Certificate. Each Certificate shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by an authorized officer of the Purchase Contract Agent by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. SECTION 3.04. Temporary Certificates. Pending the preparation of definitive Certificates, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holders, and deliver, in lieu of such definitive Certificates, temporary Certificates which are in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit B hereto, as the case may be, with such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed or engraved thereon as may be required by the rules of any securities exchange on which the Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, are listed, or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers of the Company executing such Certificates, as evidenced by their execution of the Certificates. 24
If temporary Certificates are issued, the Company will cause definitive Certificates to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Certificates, the temporary Certificates shall be exchangeable for definitive Certificates upon surrender of the temporary Certificates at the Corporate Trust Office, at the expense of the Company and without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Certificates, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, one or more definitive Certificates of like tenor and denominations and evidencing a like number of Units as the temporary Certificate or Certificates so surrendered. Until so exchanged, the temporary Certificates shall in all respects evidence the same benefits and the same obligations with respect to the Units evidenced thereby as definitive Certificates. SECTION 3.05. Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange. The Purchase Contract Agent shall keep at the Corporate Trust Office a register (the "SECURITY REGISTER") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Purchase Contract Agent shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers of Certificates (the Purchase Contract Agent, in such capacity, the "SECURITY REGISTRAR"). The Security Registrar shall record separately the registration and transfer of the Certificates evidencing Normal Units and Stripped Units. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the designated transferee or transferees, and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates of any authorized denominations, like tenor, and evidencing a like number of Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be. At the option of the Holder, Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates, of any authorized denominations and evidencing a like number of Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, upon surrender of the Certificates to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver the Certificates which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate shall evidence the ownership of the same number of Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same obligations under this Agreement as the Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. 25
Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Purchase Contract Agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent duly executed, by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges pursuant to Sections 3.04, 3.06, 3.09 and 8.05 not involving any transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder and deliver any Certificate in exchange for any other Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest to occur of any Early Settlement Date with respect to such Certificate, any Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such Certificate, the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall: (i) if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (including upon any Cash Settlement) or an Early Settlement Date or a Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such other Certificate has occurred, deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Purchase Contracts forming a part of the Units evidenced by such other Certificate; or (ii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, transfer the Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities, or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.15 and Article Five hereof. SECTION 3.06. Book-Entry Interests. The Certificates, on original issuance, will be issued in the form of one or more fully registered Global Certificates, to be delivered to the Depositary or its custodian by, or on behalf of, the Company. The Company hereby designates DTC as the initial Depositary. Such Global Certificates shall initially be registered on the books and records of the Company in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depositary, and no Beneficial Owner will receive a definitive Certificate representing such Beneficial Owner's interest in such Global Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.09. The Purchase Contract Agent shall enter into an agreement with the 26
Depositary if so requested by the Company. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Certificates have been issued to Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 3.09: (i) the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall be in full force and effect; (ii) the Company shall be entitled to deal with the Depositary for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, making Contract Adjustment Payments and receiving approvals, votes or consents hereunder) as the Holder of the Units and the sole holder of the Global Certificates and shall have no obligation to the Beneficial Owners; (iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.06 conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall control; and (iv) the rights of the Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Depositary and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Beneficial Owners and the Depositary or the Depositary Participants. Transfers of securities evidenced by Global Certificates shall be made through the facilities of the Depositary, and any cancellation of, or increase or decrease in the number of, such securities (including the creation of Stripped Units and the recreation of Normal Units pursuant to Sections 3.13 and 3.14 respectively) shall be accomplished by making appropriate annotations on the Schedule of Increases and Decreases for such Global Certificate. SECTION 3.07. Notices to Holders. Whenever a notice or other communication to the Holders is required to be given under this Agreement, the Company or the Company's agent shall give such notices and communications to the Holders and, with respect to any Units registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary, the Company or the Company's agent shall, except as set forth herein, have no obligations to the Beneficial Owners. SECTION 3.08. Appointment of Successor Depositary. If the Depositary elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Units, the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Units. SECTION 3.09. Definitive Certificates. If: 27
(i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Units and no successor Depositary has been appointed pursuant to Section 3.08 within 90 days after such notice; or (ii) the Depositary ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as the Depositary and so notifies the Company, and no successor Depositary has been appointed pursuant to Section 3.08 within 90 days after such notice; or (iii) the Company determines in its discretion that the Global Certificates shall be exchangeable for definitive Certificates, then (x) definitive Certificates shall be prepared by the Company with respect to such Units and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent and (y) upon surrender of the Global Certificates representing the Units by the Depositary, accompanied by registration instructions, the Company shall cause definitive Certificates to be delivered to Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Depositary. The Company and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on and shall be authorized and protected in relying on, such instructions. Each definitive Certificate so delivered shall evidence Units of the same kind and tenor as the Global Certificate so surrendered in respect thereof. SECTION 3.10. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Certificates. If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate, evidencing the same number of Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent that such Certificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate, evidencing the same number of Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to 28
authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, a Certificate on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest of any Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost or mutilated Certificate, any Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost or mutilated Certificate, the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall: (i) if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificate has occurred, deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Purchase Contracts forming a part of the Units evidenced by such Certificate; or (ii) if a Cash Settlement with respect to such lost or mutilated Certificate or if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, transfer the Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as the case may be, evidenced thereby, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.15 and Article Five hereof. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other fees and expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Purchase Contract Agent) connected therewith. Every new Certificate issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and of the Holder in respect of the Units evidenced thereby, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate (and the Units evidenced thereby) shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits and be subject to all the obligations of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Certificates delivered hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude, to the extent lawful, all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates. SECTION 3.11. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, may treat the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered as the owner of the Units evidenced 29
thereby for purposes of (subject to any applicable record date) any payment or distribution attributable to the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (if any) (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of such term), as applicable, payment of Contract Adjustment Payments and performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever in connection with such Units, whether or not such payment, distribution, or performance shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company nor the Purchase Contract Agent, nor any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Certificate, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Global Certificate, or impair, as between such Depositary and the related Beneficial Owner, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of rights of the Depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Certificate. None of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Certificate or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. SECTION 3.12. Cancellation. All Certificates surrendered for delivery of shares of Common Stock on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or upon the transfer of Senior Notes, or for delivery of the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, after the occurrence of a Termination Event or pursuant to a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement, or upon the registration of transfer or exchange of a Unit, or a Collateral Substitution or the recreation of Normal Units shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Purchase Contract Agent, be delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent along with appropriate written instructions regarding the cancellation thereof and, if not already cancelled, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent for cancellation any Certificates previously authenticated, executed and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Certificates so delivered shall, upon an Issuer Order, be promptly cancelled by the Purchase Contract Agent. No Certificates shall be authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holder and delivered in lieu of or in exchange for any Certificates cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. All cancelled Certificates held by the Purchase Contract Agent shall be disposed of in accordance with its customary practices. If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall acquire any Certificate, such acquisition shall not operate as a cancellation of such Certificate unless and until such Certificate 30
is delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent cancelled or with appropriate written instructions regarding the cancellation thereof. SECTION 3.13. Creation of Stripped Units by Substitution of Treasury Securities. Unless the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of the Normal Units, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder may, at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, effect a Collateral Substitution and separate the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes from the related Purchase Contract in respect of such Holder's Normal Unit by substituting for such Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes, Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes underlying such Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes; provided that Holders may make Collateral Substitutions only in integral multiples of 20 Normal Units. To effect such substitution, the Holder must: (1) transfer to the Collateral Agent for deposit with the Securities Intermediary Treasury Securities having an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes comprising part of such Normal Units; and (2) transfer the related Normal Units to the Purchase Contract Agent accompanied by a notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) stating that the Holder has deposited the relevant amount of Treasury Securities to the Securities Intermediary and (ii) requesting that the Purchase Contract Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes comprising a part of such Normal Units, whereupon the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly provide an instruction to such effect to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Pledge Agreement. Upon receipt of the Treasury Securities described in clause (1) above and the instruction described in clause (2) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will cause the Securities Intermediary to effect the release of such Senior Notes from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and the transfer of such Senior Notes to the Purchase Contract Agent on behalf of the Holder. Upon receipt of such Senior Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Normal Units; 31
(ii) transfer such Senior Notes to the Holder (such Senior Notes shall be tradeable as a separate security, independent of the resulting Stripped Units); and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a Stripped Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.03 evidencing the same number of Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Normal Units. Holders who elect to separate the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes from the related Purchase Contracts by substituting Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes shall be responsible for any fees or expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent) in respect of the substitution, and neither the Company nor the Purchase Contract Agent shall be responsible for any such fees or expenses. If the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of the Normal Units and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder may, at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio included in such Normal Units, but only in integral multiples of 12,500 Normal Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer Treasury Securities having an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the Normal Units for which substitution is being made to the Collateral Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of, and transfer to the Holder, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio in the manner set forth above. In the event a Holder making a Collateral Substitution pursuant to this Section 3.13 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the Normal Units or fails to deliver Normal Units Certificates to the Purchase Contract Agent after depositing Treasury Securities with the Collateral Agent, any distributions on the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio constituting a part of such Normal Units shall be held in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Normal Units are so transferred or the Normal Units Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent that such Normal Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company. Except as described in Section 5.02 or in this Section 3.13 or in connection with a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Normal Unit remains in effect, such Normal Units shall not be separable into their constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interest in 32
the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and the Purchase Contract comprising such Normal Units may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Normal Unit. SECTION 3.14. Recreation of Normal Units. Unless the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of the Normal Units, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder of Stripped Units may recreate Normal Units at any time on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date; provided that Holders of Stripped Units may only recreate Normal Units in integral multiples of 20 Stripped Units. To recreate Normal Units, the Holder must: (1) transfer to the Collateral Agent for deposit with the Securities Intermediary Senior Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount at stated maturity of the Treasury Securities comprising part of the Stripped Units; and (2) transfer the related Stripped Units to the Purchase Contract Agent accompanied by a notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Senior Notes to the Securities Intermediary and (ii) requesting that the Purchase Contract Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Treasury Securities underlying such Stripped Units, whereupon the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly provide an instruction to such effect to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C to the Pledge Agreement. Upon receipt of the Senior Notes described in clause (1) above and the instruction described in clause (2) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will cause the Securities Intermediary to effect the release of the Treasury Securities having a corresponding aggregate principal amount at maturity from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and the transfer thereof to the Purchase Contract Agent on behalf of the Holder. Upon receipt of such Treasury Securities, the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Stripped Units; (ii) transfer the Treasury Securities to the Holder; and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a Normal Unit Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.03 evidencing the same number of Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Stripped Units. 33
Holders who elect to recreate Normal Units shall be responsible for any fees or expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent) in respect of the recreation, and neither the Company nor the Purchase Contract Agent shall be responsible for any such fees or expenses. If the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of the Normal Units, a Holder of Stripped Units may at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date substitute the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio for Treasury Securities, but only in multiples of 12,500 Stripped Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer to the Collateral Agent the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio in an amount such that the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the portion of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) is equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Stripped Units, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder, the appropriate Treasury Securities in the manner set forth above. Except as provided in Section 5.02 or in this Section 3.14 or in connection with a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Stripped Unit remains in effect, such Stripped Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Stripped Unit in respect of the 1/20 of a Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract comprising such Stripped Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Stripped Unit. SECTION 3.15. Transfer of Collateral upon Occurrence of Termination Event. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event and the transfer to the Purchase Contract Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, that are components of the Normal Units and the Stripped Units, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent shall request transfer instructions with respect to the appropriate aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes underlying Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from each Holder by written request, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, mailed to such Holder at its address as it appears in the Security Register. Upon book-entry transfer of the Normal Units or the Stripped Units or delivery of a Normal Units Certificate or Stripped Units Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent with such transfer instructions, the Purchase Contract Agent shall transfer the appropriate aggregate 34
principal amount of Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying such Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, to such Holder by book-entry transfer, or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with such instructions and, in the case of the Senior Notes, in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Indenture No. 3. In the event a Holder of Normal Units or Stripped Units fails to effect such transfer or delivery, the Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying such Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and any distributions thereon, shall be held in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until the earlier to occur of: (i) the transfer of such Normal Units, the Stripped Units or surrender of the Normal Units Certificate or Stripped Units Certificate or the receipt by the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent from such Holder of satisfactory evidence that such Normal Units Certificate or Stripped Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company; and (ii) the expiration of the time period specified in the abandoned property laws of the state in which the Purchase Contract Agent holds such property. SECTION 3.16. No Consent to Assumption. Each Holder of a Unit, by acceptance thereof, shall be deemed expressly to have withheld any consent to the assumption under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, of the Purchase Contract by the Company or its trustee, receiver, liquidator or a person or entity performing similar functions in the event that the Company becomes the debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or Federal law providing for reorganization or liquidation. ARTICLE 4 THE SENIOR NOTES AND APPLICABLE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE TREASURY PORTFOLIO SECTION 4.01. Interest Payments; Rights to Interest Payments Preserved. Any payment on the Senior Notes attributable to the related Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of such term), as the case may be, which is paid on any Payment Date shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Purchase Contract Agent from the Collateral Agent as provided by the terms of the Pledge Agreement, be paid to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Normal Units Certificates) of which 35
such Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, forms a part is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Each Normal Units Certificate evidencing Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Normal Units Certificate shall carry the right to receive accrued and unpaid interest or distributions, and to accrue future interest or distributions, which were attributable to the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio underlying such other Normal Units Certificate. In the case of any Normal Unit with respect to which (A) Cash Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is properly effected pursuant to Section 5.02 hereof, (B) Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is properly effected pursuant to Section 5.07 hereof, (C) Cash Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is properly effected pursuant to Section 5.04(b)(2) hereof, (D) a Collateral Substitution is properly effected pursuant to Section 3.13, or (E) a Successful Initial Remarketing occurs with respect to the Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes that are components of such Normal Unit, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and prior to or on the next succeeding Payment Date, interest attributable to the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or distributions on the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying such Normal Unit otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Cash Settlement, Early Settlement, Cash Merger Early Settlement, Collateral Substitution or Initial Remarketing, and such payment or distributions shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Purchase Contract Agent, be payable to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Normal Units Certificates) was registered at the close of business on the Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, in the case of any Normal Units with respect to which Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is properly effected, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution has been effected, payments attributable to the related Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes or distributions on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, that would otherwise be payable or made after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date, Cash Merger Early Settlement Date or the date of the Collateral Substitution, as the case may be, shall not be payable hereunder to the Holder of such Normal Units; provided, however, that to the extent that such Holder continues to hold Separate Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio that formerly comprised a part of such Holder's Normal Units, such Holder shall be entitled to receive interest on such Separate Senior Notes or distributions on the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. 36
SECTION 4.02. Notice and Voting. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Senior Notes, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Senior Notes are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Senior Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Holders of Normal Units a notice: (i) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation; (ii) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Purchase Contract Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Senior Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Purchase Contract Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Senior Notes, or any portion thereof, underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes comprising a part of their Normal Units; and (iii) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Normal Units on such record date received by the Purchase Contract Agent at least six days prior to such meeting, the Purchase Contract Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum principal amount of Senior Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Normal Unit, the Purchase Contract Agent shall abstain from voting the principal amount of the Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes comprising a part of such Normal Unit. The Company hereby agrees, if applicable, to solicit Holders of Normal Units to timely instruct the Purchase Contract Agent in order to enable the Purchase Contract Agent to vote such Senior Notes. The Holders of Normal Units and Stripped Units shall have no voting or other rights in respect of Common Stock. SECTION 4.03. Special Event Redemption. (a) If the Company elects to redeem the Senior Notes on any Payment Date following the occurrence of a Special Event as permitted by the Indenture, it shall notify the Collateral Agent in writing, of the occurrence of any Special Event, of its intention to redeem the Senior Notes and of the Special Event Redemption Date. On the Special Event Redemption Date, the Collateral Agent shall surrender the Pledged Senior Notes to the Indenture Trustee against delivery of an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Price for such Pledged Senior Notes. 37
Thereafter, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Normal Units the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such funds to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of such Normal Units. (b) Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, (i) the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) will be substituted as Collateral for the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Pledged Senior Notes and will be held by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement to secure the obligation of each Holder of a Normal Unit to purchase the Common Stock of the Company under the Purchase Contract constituting a part of such Normal Unit, (ii) the Holders of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights and obligations with respect to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Holders of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Pledged Senior Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and (iii) any reference herein to the Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term). The Company may cause to be made in any Normal Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) for Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Pledged Senior Notes as Collateral. (c) The Holders of Separate Senior Notes shall directly receive the Redemption Price for the Separate Senior Notes. ARTICLE 5 THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS SECTION 5.01. Purchase of Shares of Common Stock. (a) Each Purchase Contract shall obligate the Holder of the related Units to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount (the "PURCHASE PRICE"), a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock (subject to Section 5.09) equal to the Settlement Rate unless an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to the Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part shall have occurred.

The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a), the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a), the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of this Section 5.04(a) and the denominator shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. The "CLOSING PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means: (i) the closing sale price as of the close of the principal trading session (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") on such date; (ii) if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price per share (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed; 39

A "TRADING DAY" means a day on which the Common Stock (1) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (2) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. (b) Each Holder of a Normal Unit or a Stripped Unit, by its acceptance of such Unit: (i) irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contract on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact (including, without limitation, the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder); (ii) agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof; (iii) covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contract for so long as such Holder remains a Holder of a Normal Unit or a Stripped Unit; (iv) consents to the provisions hereof; (v) irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement on its behalf and in its name as its attorney-in-fact; (vi) consents to, and agrees to be bound by, the Pledge of such Holder's right, title and interest in and to the Collateral Account, including the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, the Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) or the Treasury Securities pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; and 40

(c) Each Holder of a Normal Unit or a Stripped Unit, by its acceptance thereof, further covenants and agrees that to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.02 hereof and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, Proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as applicable, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such Proceeds. (d) Upon registration of transfer of a Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee) by the terms of this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts underlying such Certificate and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts underlying the Certificate so transferred and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Certificate, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. SECTION 5.02. Remarketing; Payment of Purchase Price. (a) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Initial Remarketing Date, the Company shall engage the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement for Remarketing the Senior Notes. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date, the Purchase Contract Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed pursuant to clause (ii) below. Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to clause (ii) below, will present for Remarketing the Separate Senior Notes, to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice 41
from the Purchase Contract Agent and Custodial Agent and such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent and Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Initial Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) (the "INITIAL REMARKETING") such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price of approximately 100.50% (or, if the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at such rate, at a rate below 100.50% in the discretion of the Remarketing Agent, but in no event less than 100%, (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at a price equal to or greater than 100% (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price and such remarketing has settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement (a "SUCCESSFUL INITIAL REMARKETING"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Initial Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. The Remarketing Agent may deduct as a remarketing fee (the "REMARKETING FEE") an amount up to the lesser of (i) 25 basis points (0.25%) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price and (ii) the amount of the proceeds of such Remarketing in excess of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. None of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, or any Holders of Normal Units or holders of Separate Senior Notes on whose behalf Pledged Senior Notes or Separate Senior Notes are so remarketed will otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, any proceeds of the Initial Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. With respect to Pledged Senior Notes, any proceeds of the Initial Remarketing in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Pledged Senior Notes will be remitted to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Normal Units. The Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the obligation of the Holders of Normal Units to pay the Purchase Price for the Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Initial Remarketing, the Holders of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Holder of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and any reference to the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes herein or in the Certificates shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to 42
interest attributable to Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Normal Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of such Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio for an Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes. If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) in the Initial Remarketing (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100% (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price or the Initial Remarketing is not settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for any reason, including the failure to fulfill a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement, the Initial Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED INITIAL REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) subject to such Remarketing to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. (ii) Prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, but no earlier than the Payment Date immediately preceding such date, Holders of Separate Senior Notes may elect to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed under the Remarketing Agreement by delivering their Separate Senior Notes, along with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit F to the Pledge Agreement, to the Custodial Agent. After such time, such election shall become an irrevocable election to have such Separate Senior Notes remarketed in such Remarketing and, if such Remarketing fails, in any subsequent Remarketing. The Custodial Agent shall hold Separate Senior Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account in which the Pledged Senior Notes shall be held. Holders of Separate Senior Notes electing to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw that election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit G to the Pledge Agreement, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Senior Notes to such Holder. Promptly after 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of the Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed and will deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all such Separate Senior Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to Section 5.07(c) of the Pledge Agreement and not validly withdrawn prior to such date. (iii) Not later than seven calendar days nor more than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable Remarketing Date, the Company shall request the Depositary or its 43
nominee to notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Units of the procedures to be followed in such Remarketing. (iv) The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, if required by applicable law, a registration statement with regard to the full amount of the Senior Notes to be remarketed in the Initial Remarketing, the Second Remarketing, the Third Remarketing or the Final Remarketing, as the case may be, shall be effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a form that will enable the Remarketing Agent to rely on it in connection with such Remarketing. (v) The Company shall cause a notice of a Failed Remarketing to be published (with a copy of such notice to be provided to the Purchase Contract Agent) no later than the second Business Day immediately following the date on which such Remarketing failed, in a daily newspaper in the English language of general circulation in The City of New York, which is expected to be The Wall Street Journal. (b) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Second Remarketing Date, if a Failed Initial Remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent will use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Senior Notes (a "SECOND REMARKETING") on the Second Remarketing Date. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Second Remarketing Date for such Second Remarketing, the Purchase Contract Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii). Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Purchase Contract Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Second Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price of approximately 100.50% (or, if the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at such rate, at a rate below 100.50% in the discretion of the Remarketing Agent, but in no event less than 100%, (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at a price equal to or greater than 100% (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price and such remarketing is settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement (a "SUCCESSFUL SECOND REMARKETING"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Second Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. The Remarketing Agent may deduct the Remarketing Fee from any amount 44
of such proceeds in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. None of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holders of Normal Units or holders of Separate Senior Notes on whose behalf Pledged Senior Notes or Separate Senior Notes are so remarketed will otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, any proceeds of the Second Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. With respect to Pledged Senior Notes, any proceeds of the Second Remarketing in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Pledged Senior Notes will be remitted to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Normal Units. The Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the obligation of the Holders of Normal Units to pay the Purchase Price for the Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Second Remarketing, the Holders of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Holder of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and any reference to Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes herein or in the Certificates shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest attributable to Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Normal Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes. If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) in a Second Remarketing (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100% (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price or the Second Remarketing is not settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for any reason, including the failure to fulfill a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement, the Second Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED SECOND REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Second Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) subject to such Remarketing to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. 45
(ii) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Third Remarketing Date, if a Failed Second Remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent will use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Senior Notes (a "THIRD REMARKETING") on the Third Remarketing Date. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Third Remarketing Date for such Third Remarketing, the Purchase Contract Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii). Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Purchase Contract Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Third Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) such Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price of approximately 100.50% (or, if the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes at such rate, at a rate below 100.50% in the discretion of the Remarketing Agent, but in no event less than 100%, (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes at a price equal to or greater than 100% (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price and such remarketing is settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement (a "SUCCESSFUL THIRD REMARKETING"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Third Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. The Remarketing Agent may deduct the Remarketing Fee from any amount of such proceeds in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. None of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holders of Normal Units or holders of Separate Senior Notes on whose behalf Pledged Senior Notes or Separate Senior Notes are so remarketed will otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, any proceeds of the Third Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. With respect to Pledged Senior Notes, any proceeds of the Third Remarketing in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Pledged Senior Notes will be remitted to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Normal Units. The Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in 46
clause (i) of the definition of such term) will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the obligation of the Holders of Normal Units to pay the Purchase Price for the Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Third Remarketing, the Holders of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Holder of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and any reference to the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes herein or in the Certificates shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and any reference to interest attributable to the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes herein or in the Certificates shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Normal Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes. If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) in a Third Remarketing (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100% (net of any Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price or the Third Remarketing is not settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for any reason, including the failure to fulfill a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement, the Third Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED THIRD REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Third Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) subject to such Remarketing to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. (c) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, if no Successful Remarketing has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, each Holder of Normal Units shall have the right to satisfy such Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contract on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in cash by notifying the Purchase Contract Agent by use of a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto of its intention to pay in cash ("CASH SETTLEMENT") prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date; provided that such Holder may only effect a Cash Settlement in integral multiples of 20 Units. Promptly following 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Purchase Contract Agent shall notify the Collateral Agent and the Indenture Trustee of the receipt of such notices from Holders intending to make a Cash Settlement. 47
(ii) A Holder of a Normal Unit who has so notified the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement shall pay the Purchase Price to the Securities Intermediary for deposit in the Collateral Account prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashiers' check or wire transfer, in each case in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Securities Intermediary. Any cash received by the Collateral Agent shall be invested promptly by the Securities Intermediary in Permitted Investments pursuant to written instructions received from the Company and paid to the Company on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in settlement of the Purchase Contracts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Any funds received by the Securities Intermediary in respect of the investment earnings from such Permitted Investments in excess of the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased by such Holder shall be distributed to the Purchase Contract Agent when received for payment to the Holder. (iii) If a Holder of a Normal Unit does not notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with Section 5.02(c)(i) above, or does notify the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with Section 5.02(c)(i) above but fails to make such payment as required by Section 5.02(c)(ii) above, such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Senior Notes pursuant to the Final Remarketing as described in Section 5.02(d) below. (iv) Promptly after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent, based on cash payments received by the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(ii) hereof, shall promptly notify the Purchase Contract Agent and the Indenture Trustee of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes to be tendered for purchase in the Remarketing in a notice pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement. (d) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, if a Failed Third Remarketing has occurred, the Senior Notes of such Holders of Normal Units who have not notified the Purchase Contract Agent of their intention to effect a Cash Settlement as provided in Section 5.02(c)(i) above, or who have so notified the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with Section 5.02(c)(i) above but have failed to make such payment as required by Section 5.02(c)(ii) above, and the Separate Senior Notes of any holder who has elected for its Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii) will be sold by the Remarketing Agent (the "FINAL REMARKETING") on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (the "FINAL REMARKETING DATE"). In order to facilitate the Final Remarketing, the Purchase Contract Agent, based on the notices specified in Section 5.02(c)(iv), and the Collateral Agent, based on the notices specified in Section 5.02(a)(ii), shall notify the Remarketing Agent, by 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately 48
preceding the Final Remarketing Date, of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes or aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes that are to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), as the case may be. Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed to the Remarketing Agent. (ii) Upon receipt of such notice from the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent and such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as set forth in clause (i) above, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Final Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price equal to approximately 100.50% (or, if the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes at such rate, at a rate below 100.50% in the discretion of the Remarketing Agent, but in no event less than 100%, net of the Final Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the aggregate principal amount of such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes being remarketed, as provided in the Remarketing Agreement. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at a price equal to or greater than 100% (net of the Final Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) and such remarketing is settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement (a "SUCCESSFUL FINAL REMARKETING"), the Remarketing Agent will remit the proceeds attributable to the Remarketing of the Pledged Senior Notes from such Successful Final Remarketing to the Collateral Agent. The Remarketing Agent may deduct as the remarketing fee (the "FINAL REMARKETING FEE") an amount up to the lesser of (i) 25 basis points (0.25%) of the aggregate principal amount of the remarketed Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) and (ii) the amount of the proceeds of a Successful Final Remarketing in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the remarketed Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any). With respect to Separate Senior Notes, any proceeds of the Final Remarketing in excess of the Final Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. The proceeds from the Remarketing remitted to the Collateral Agent shall be invested by the Collateral Agent in Permitted Investments, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, and then applied to satisfy in full the obligations of such Holders of Normal Units to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Any proceeds in excess of those required to pay the Purchase Price and the Final Remarketing Fee will be remitted to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Normal Units. (iii) If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) at a price not less 49
than 100% (net of the Final Remarketing Fee and any other fees and commissions) of the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed in the Final Remarketing (other than to the Company) or the Final Remarketing is not settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for any reason, including the failure to fulfill a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement, the remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED FINAL REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Final Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the remarketed Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. Upon a Failed Final Remarketing, a default shall be deemed to have occurred under this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, shall exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Pledged Senior Notes, including, without limitation, those actions specified in paragraph 5.02(e)(i) below; provided, that if upon a Failed Final Remarketing, the Collateral Agent exercises such rights for the benefit of the Company with respect to the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and related Pledged Senior Notes, any accrued and unpaid interest on the Pledged Senior Notes attributable to such Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes shall become payable by the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Beneficial Owner of the related Normal Unit. (e) With respect to any Pledged Senior Notes which are subject to a Failed Final Remarketing, and any Pledged Senior Notes with respect to which the Holder has notified the Purchase Contract Agent of his intent to effect Cash Settlement and failed to deliver the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(ii), in each case resulting in an event of default under this Agreement, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company reserves all of its rights as a secured party with respect thereto and, subject to applicable law and paragraph 5.02(h) below, may, in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts among other things, (A) retain Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Pledged Senior Notes in accordance with applicable law or (B) dispose of such Pledged Senior Notes in accordance with applicable law, which in each case shall constitute payment in full for the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased under the Purchase Contracts. (f) Any distribution to Holders of any payments described above shall be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in New York City maintained for that purpose or, at the option of the Holder, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Security Register. (g) Upon Cash Settlement of any Purchase Contract: (i) the Collateral Agent will in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement cause the Pledged Senior Notes to be released from the Pledge, free and clear 50
of any security interest of the Company, and transferred to the Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee as soon as practicable; and (ii) subject to the receipt thereof, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, by book-entry transfer or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with written instructions provided by the Holder thereof, transfer such Senior Notes (or, if no such instructions are given to the Purchase Contract Agent by the Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall hold such Senior Notes, and any interest payment thereon, in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder until the expiration of the time period specified in the abandoned property laws of the relevant state where such property is held). (h) The obligations of the Holders to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and, except to the extent satisfied by Early Settlement, Cash Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders, and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between the proceeds of the disposition of Collateral and the Purchase Price. (i) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates thereof to the Holder of the related Units unless the Company shall have received payment for the Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. SECTION 5.03. Issuance of Shares of Common Stock. Unless a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred, subject to Section 5.04(b), on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date upon receipt of the aggregate Purchase Price payable on all Outstanding Units, the Company shall issue and deposit with the Purchase Contract Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Units, one or more certificates representing newly issued shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "PURCHASE CONTRACT SETTLEMENT FUND") to which the Holders are entitled hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive forthwith in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of newly issued whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article Five (after taking into account all Units then held by such Holder), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.09 and any dividends or distributions with respect to 51
such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Purchase Contract Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered (but excluding any Depositary or nominee thereof), no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable. SECTION 5.04. Adjustment of Settlement Rate. (a) Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc. (1) In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock in Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination; and (ii) the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (1), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company agrees that it shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (2) In case the Company shall issue rights, warrants or options, other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plans or share purchase plans, to all holders of its Common Stock (not being available on an equivalent basis to Holders of the Units upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Units) entitling them, for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date of announcement of such issuance, 52
the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date of such announcement shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such announcement plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price; and (ii) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such announcement plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Business Day following the date of such announcement. The Company agrees that it shall notify the Purchase Contract Agent if any issuance of such rights, warrants or options is cancelled or not completed following the announcement thereof and the Settlement Rate shall thereupon be readjusted to the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the date of such announcement. For the purposes of this paragraph (2), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company agrees that it shall not issue any such rights, warrants or options in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (3) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective. (4) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including shares of capital stock, securities, cash and property but excluding any rights, warrants or options referred to in paragraph (2) of this Section 5.04(a), any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (1) of this Section 5.04(a)), the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which: 53
(i) the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock; and (ii) the denominator shall be such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (4) is applicable, paragraph (2) of this Section 5.04(a) shall not be applicable. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Settlement Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (5) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.04(b) applies, as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (4) of this Section or as a regular periodic cash dividend or distribution) in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (I) the aggregate amount of any other distributions (other than regular periodic cash dividends or distributions) to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution (the "TRAILING 12 MONTH PERIOD") and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section has been made and (II) the aggregate amount of any cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of consideration (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd- lot tender offer) payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and calculated as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock concluded within the Trailing 12 Month Period and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section has been made, exceeds 15% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, in such case, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on such record date shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the Current Market Price of Common Stock on such record date less the amount of cash so distributed (and not excluded as provided above) applicable to one share of Common Stock; and (ii) the denominator shall be the Current Market Price of Common Stock, 54
such increase to be effective at the opening of business on the day following the record date; provided, however, that in the event the portion of cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder of a Unit shall have the right to receive upon settlement of the Units the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder settled each Unit on the record date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Settlement Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (6) If the Company or any subsidiary of the Company shall make a tender or exchange offer (other than any odd-lot tender offer) for all or any portion of the Common Stock and upon expiration of such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) the Company or its subsidiary shall be required to pay to shareholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares (as herein defined) any consideration, then if the sum of (I) the fair market value of the aggregate consideration to be paid in such tender offer or exchange offer (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution) plus (II) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer), by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (6) has been made, plus (III) the aggregate amount of any distributions (other than regular periodic cash dividends or distributions) to all holders of Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (5) has been made, exceeds 15% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the last time (the "EXPIRATION TIME") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the Expiration Time, then, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day of the Expiration Time shall be adjusted by dividing by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to (A) the product of (I) the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less (B) the amount of cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to shareholders based on the transactions described in clauses (I), (II) and (III) above (assuming in the case of 55
clause (I) the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares); and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (A) the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the Expiration Time and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "PURCHASED SHARES"), such adjustment to become effective at the opening of business on the date following the date of the Expiration Time. (7) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.04(b) applies) shall be deemed to involve: (i) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution" and the "date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (4) of this Section); and (ii) a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (3) of this Section). (8) The "CURRENT MARKET PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means the average of the daily Closing Prices on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending not later than the earlier of such date of determination and the day before the "ex date" with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such computation. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which Common Stock trades regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution. (9) All adjustments to the Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent thereof; provided, 56
however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. (10) The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason. (11) The Company has entered into a Rights Agreement dated as of November 1, 1995 (the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT") with The Bank of New York pursuant to which share purchase rights (the "RIGHTS") have been, and may in the future be, issued in respect of shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock issued upon settlement of any Purchase Contract pursuant to this Article 5 shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of Rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such settlement shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as provided by and subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement as in effect at the time of such settlement. If after the date of this Agreement the Rights separate from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Rights Agreement so that a Holder would not be entitled to receive any Rights in respect of the Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Purchase Contract, the Settlement Rate will be adjusted as provided in this Section 5.04 on the separation date, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the Rights. In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may amend the Rights Agreement to provide that upon settlement Holders will receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such settlement, the Rights that would have attached to such shares of Common Stock if the Rights had not become separated from the Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of the Rights Agreement. If the Company hereafter adopts any stockholder rights plan similar to the Rights Agreement, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of its Purchase Contracts in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement the related rights for the Common Stock, whether or not the rights under the future stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of settlement, but otherwise subject to the generally applicable terms of such plan, and no additional adjustment to the Settlement Rate shall be made for the future stockholder rights plan under this Section 5.04. (b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event. (1) In the event of: (i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or 57
consolidation are not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another corporation); (ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety; (iii) any statutory share exchange of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition); or (iv) any liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any event described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), a "REORGANIZATION EVENT"), each Purchase Contract shall become, without the consent of the Holder of the Unit representing such Purchase Contract, an agreement to purchase only the kind of securities, cash and other property receivable upon consummation of such Reorganization Event by a holder of Common Stock immediately prior to the closing date of such Reorganization Event. The amount of such securities, cash and other property receivable upon settlement of each such Purchase Contract after the consummation of the Reorganization Event shall be based on the value as of such settlement date of the hypothetical amount of securities, cash and other property that would have been received upon consummation of the Reorganization Event in exchange for the maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable under a Purchase Contract immediately prior to the closing date of the Reorganization Event (collectively, the "EXCHANGE PROPERTY"). In determining the kind and amount of the Exchange Property pursuant to the foregoing, it will be assumed that such holder of Common Stock is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "CONSTITUENT PERSON"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-affiliates and such Holder failed to exercise its rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("NON-ELECTING SHARE"), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). The actual amount of Exchange Property receivable upon settlement of each Purchase Contract shall be (1) in the case of settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or pursuant to Section 5.04(b)(2), a variable amount based upon the applicable Settlement Rate and 58
the Adjusted Applicable Market Value of the Exchange Property at such time and (2) in the case of any Early Settlement, determined in accordance with the procedures described under Section 5.07 using the Settlement Rate that results in the minimum amount of Exchange Property being delivered under such Purchase Contract. For purposes of this Section 5.04(b)(1) and Section 5.04(b)(2), the term "Adjusted Applicable Market Value" shall be deemed to refer to the "Adjusted Applicable Market Value" of the Exchange Property, and such value shall be determined (A) with respect to any publicly traded securities that compose all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the Closing Price of such securities, (B) in the case of any cash that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the amount of such cash and (C) in the case of any other property that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the value of such property, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose; provided that prior to the separation of the Rights or any similar stockholder rights from the Common Stock, such Rights or similar stockholder rights shall be deemed to have no value. The term "Closing Price" shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. The term "Trading Day" shall be deemed to refer to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that each Holder of an Outstanding Unit shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.04(b). Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.04. The above provisions of this Section 5.04 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events. (2) In the event of a consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person, any merger of another Person into the Company (other than a merger that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of Common Stock) in which 30% or more of the total consideration paid to the Company's shareholders consists of cash or cash equivalents (a "CASH MERGER"), then a Holder of a Unit may settle ("CASH MERGER EARLY SETTLEMENT") its Purchase Contract, upon the conditions set forth below, at the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the closing of the Cash Merger; provided that (i) the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date (as defined below) is no later than the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and (ii) no Cash Merger Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2) unless, at the time such Cash Merger Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Cash Merger Early 59
Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (B) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Cash Merger Early Settlement. Within five Business Days of the completion of a Cash Merger, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Units of such completion of a Cash Merger, which shall specify the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2), the date on which such Cash Merger Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be 10 days after the date of such written notice by the Company, but which shall in no event be later than the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date) (the "CASH MERGER EARLY SETTLEMENT DATE"), the applicable Settlement Rate and the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder upon settlement. Subject to the succeeding sentence, Normal Units Holders and Stripped Units Holders may only effect Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2) in integral multiples of 20 Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of the Normal Units, Normal Units Holders may only effect Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2) in multiples of 12,500 Normal Units. Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of Section 5.01(a) shall apply with respect to a Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2). In order to exercise the right to effect Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver, no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Stated Amount times (B) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Cash Merger Early Settlement. If a Holder properly effects an effective Cash Merger Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.04(b)(2), the Company will deliver (or will cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date: 60
(i) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Purchase Contract if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to such Cash Merger (based on the Settlement Rate in effect at such time), assuming such Holder of Common Stock is not a Constituent Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Cash Merger provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-affiliates and such Holder failed to exercise its rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger is not the same for each non-electing share, then for the purpose of this Section 5.04(b)(2), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of determining the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (in connection with determining the appropriate Settlement Rate to be applied in the foregoing sentence), the date of the closing of the Cash Merger shall be deemed to be the Purchase Contract Settlement Date; (ii) the Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, related to the Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder is effecting a Cash Merger Early Settlement; (iii) any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments to but not including the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date payable to such Holder; and (iv) if so required under the Securities Act, a Prospectus as contemplated by this Section 5.04(b)(2). (c) All calculations and determinations pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be made by the Company or its agent and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have no responsibility with respect thereto. (d) The Normal Units or the Stripped Units of the Holders who do not elect Cash Merger Early Settlement in accordance with the foregoing will continue to remain outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the terms hereof. SECTION 5.05. Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events. (a) Whenever the Settlement Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.04 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware): 61
(i) compute the adjusted Settlement Rate in accordance with Section 5.04 and prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Settlement Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and (ii) provide a written notice to the Holders of the Units of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the Settlement Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted Settlement Rate. (b) The Purchase Contract Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Settlement Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Purchase Contract Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.05(a)(i) and any adjustment contained therein and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract; and the Purchase Contract Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. SECTION 5.06. Termination Event; Notice. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments), if the Company shall have such obligation, and the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, prior to or on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, forming part of such Units, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.04 of the Pledge Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business 62
Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. SECTION 5.07. Early Settlement. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.07, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early ("EARLY SETTLEMENT") at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date; provided that no Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.07 unless, at the time such Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (B) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Early Settlement. (b) In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") equal to: (i) the product of (A) the Stated Amount times (B) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (ii) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and subject to the last paragraph of Section 5.02, no payment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contract on account of any Contract Adjustment Payments accrued on such Purchase Contract or on account of any dividends on the Common Stock issued upon such Early Settlement. If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying any Units at or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day, such day shall be the "EARLY SETTLEMENT DATE" with respect to such Units and if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 63
p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "EARLY SETTLEMENT DATE" with respect to such Units shall be the next succeeding Business Day. Upon the receipt of such Certificate and Early Settlement Amount from the Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall pay to the Company such Early Settlement Amount, the receipt of which payment the Company shall confirm in writing. The Purchase Contract Agent shall then, in accordance with Section 5.06 of the Pledge Agreement, notify the Collateral Agent that (A) such Holder has elected to effect an Early Settlement, which notice shall set forth the number of such Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, (B) the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Early Settlement Amount and (C) all conditions to such Early Settlement have been satisfied. Subject to the succeeding sentence, Holders of Normal Units or Stripped Units may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.07 in integral multiples of 20 Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of the Normal Units, Normal Units Holders may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.07 in integral multiples of 12,500 Normal Units. Upon Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments) with respect to such Purchase Contracts shall immediately and automatically terminate. (c) Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Company shall issue, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, 0.8791 shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract as to which Early Settlement is effected (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT RATE"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.04. (d) No later than the third Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date, the Company shall cause: (i) the shares of Common Stock issuable upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts to be issued and delivered, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.09; and (ii) the Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, in the case of Normal Units, or the related Treasury Securities, in the case of Stripped Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee. 64
(e) Upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts, and subject to receipt of shares of Common Stock from the Company and the Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from the Securities Intermediary, as applicable, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Units: (i) transfer to the Holder Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, forming a part of such Units, (ii) deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.09, and (iii) if so required under the Securities Act, deliver a Prospectus for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement as contemplated by Section 5.07(a). (f) In the event that Early Settlement is effected with respect to Purchase Contracts underlying less than all the Units evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early Settlement the Company shall execute and the Purchase Contract Agent shall execute on behalf of the Holder, authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Units as to which Early Settlement was not effected. (g) A Holder of a Unit who effects Early Settlement may elect to have the Senior Notes no longer a part of a Normal Unit remarketed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.02. SECTION 5.08. Intentionally Omitted. SECTION 5.09. No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or upon Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts. If Certificates evidencing more than one Purchase Contract shall be surrendered for settlement at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Purchase Contracts evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or upon Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Company, through the Purchase Contract Agent, shall make a cash payment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to the percentage of such fractional share times the 65
Applicable Market Value calculated as if the date of such settlement were the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. The Company shall provide the Purchase Contract Agent from time to time with sufficient funds to permit the Purchase Contract Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.09 in a timely manner. SECTION 5.10. Charges and Taxes. The Company will pay all stock transfer and similar taxes attributable to the initial issuance and delivery of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase Contracts; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any exchange of or substitution for a Certificate evidencing a Unit or any issuance of a share of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered Holder of a Certificate surrendered in respect of the Units evidenced thereby, other than in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent, as custodian for such Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such share certificates or Certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the transfer or issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. SECTION 5.11. Contract Adjustment Payments. (a) Subject to Section 5.11(d), the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate is registered at the close of business on the Record Date relating to such Payment Date. The Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in Borough of Manhattan, New York City maintained for that purpose. If the book-entry system for the Units has been terminated, the Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Security Register, or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person by a prior written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent. If any date on which Contract Adjustment Payments are to be made is not a Business Day, then payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest in respect of any such delay); provided that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, then payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments will be made on the Business Day immediately preceding such Business Day. Contract Adjustment Payments payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Contract Adjustment Payments will accrue from May 23, 2003. (b) Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company's obligation to pay future Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued Contract Adjustment Payments) shall cease. 66
(c) Each Certificate delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of (including as a result of a Collateral Substitution or the recreation of Normal Units) any other Certificate shall carry the right to accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments, which right was carried by the Purchase Contracts underlying such other Certificates. (d) In the case of any Unit with respect to which Early Settlement (but not Cash Merger Early Settlement) of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected on a date that is after any Record Date and prior to or on the next succeeding Payment Date, Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Early Settlement, and such Contract Adjustment Payments shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Unit is registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence and the right to receive accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments as set forth in Section 5.04(b)(2), in the case of any Unit with respect to which Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Purchase Contract is effected, Contract Adjustment Payments that would otherwise be payable after the Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such Purchase Contract shall not be payable. (e) The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Senior Indebtedness. (f) In the event (x) of any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, or (y) subject to the provisions of Section 5.11(h) below, that (i) a default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the payment of principal, interest or any other monetary amounts due and payable on any Senior Indebtedness and such default shall have continued beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument evidencing such Senior Indebtedness (and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued), or (ii) the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness shall have been accelerated because of a default in respect of such Senior Indebtedness (and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued), then: (i) the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive, in the case of clause (x) above, payment of all amounts due or to become due upon all Senior Indebtedness and, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii) of clause (y) above, payment of all 67
amounts due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of any of the Units are entitled to receive any Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units; (ii) any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of any of the Units would be entitled except for the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q), including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units, shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the representative or representatives of the holders of Senior Indebtedness or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of such Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made of such Contract Adjustment Payments to the Holders of such Units; and (iii) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units, shall be received by the Purchase Contract Agent or the Holders of any of the Units when such payment or distribution is prohibited pursuant to Section 5.11(e) through (q), such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the representative or representatives of the holders of Senior Indebtedness or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. (g) For purposes of Section 5.11(e) through (q), the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Section 5.11(e) through (q) with respect to such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Units to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; provided that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior 68
Indebtedness is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment; (h) Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under Senior Indebtedness, other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (g) shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation, shall not be deemed a default or event of default if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company which is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, and (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review. (i) Subject to the irrevocable payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all such Contract Adjustment Payments owing on the Units shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by virtue of Section 5.11(e) through (q) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand. (j) Nothing contained in Section 5.11(e) through (q) or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Units is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Units as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company other 69
than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under Section 5.11(e) through (q), of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. (k) Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in Section 5.11(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or Purchase Contract Agent or other person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to these Section 5.11(e) through (q).

In the event that the Purchase Contract Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 5.11(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchase Contract Agent as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Section 5.11(e) through (q), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Purchase Contract Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

(o) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or 70
by the Purchase Contract Agent in respect of the Units pursuant to the provisions of this Section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) or any other provisions of this Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent, or the taking of any other action by the Purchase Contract Agent, unless and until the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof mailed or delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent at its Institutional Trust Services department from the Company, any Holder, or the holder or representative of any Senior Indebtedness; provided that if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Purchase Contract Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to or on or after such date. (p) The Purchase Contract Agent in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section with respect to any Senior Indebtedness at the time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive the Purchase Contract Agent of any of its rights as such holder. (q) No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. (r) Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Purchase Contract Agent under or pursuant to Section 7.07.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 6.04. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of any Holder to exercise any right upon a default or remedy upon a default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such right.

Undertaking for Costs. 72

SECTION 6.06. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Agreement; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Purchase Contract Agent or the Holders, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Upon the execution of any supplemental agreement under this Article, this Agreement shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental agreement shall form a part of this Agreement for all purposes; and every Holder of Certificates theretofore or thereafter authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered hereunder, shall be bound thereby. SECTION 8.05. Reference to Supplemental Agreements. Certificates authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered after the execution of any supplemental agreement pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Purchase Contract Agent, bear a notation in form approved by the Purchase Contract Agent as to any matter provided for in such supplemental agreement.

ARTICLE 9 CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, CONVEYANCE, TRANSFER OR LEASE SECTION 9.01. Covenant Not to Consolidate, Merge, Convey, Transfer or Lease Property Except under Certain Conditions. The Company covenants that it will not consolidate with, convert into, or merge with and into, any other corporation or sell, assign, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, unless: (i) either the Company shall be the continuing corporation, or the successor (if other than the Company) shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America or a State thereof or the District of Columbia and such corporation shall expressly assume all the obligations of the Company under the Purchase Contracts, this Agreement, the Pledge Agreement, the Indenture (including any supplement thereto) and the Remarketing Agreement by one or more supplemental agreements in form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent, executed and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent by such corporation; and (ii) the Company or such successor corporation, as the case may be, shall not, immediately after such consolidation, conversion, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease or conveyance, be in default of payment obligations under the Purchase Contracts, this Agreement, the Pledge Agreement, the Indenture (including any supplement thereto) or the Remarketing Agreement or in material default in the performance of any other covenants under any of the foregoing agreements. SECTION 9.02. Rights and Duties of Successor Corporation. In case of any such merger, consolidation, share exchange, sale, assignment, transfer, lease or conveyance and upon any such assumption by a successor corporation in accordance with Section 9.01, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the Company. Such successor corporation thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., any or all of the Certificates evidencing Units issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent; and, upon the order of such successor corporation, instead of the Company, and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Agreement prescribed, the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate and execute on behalf of the Holders and deliver any Certificates which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for authentication and execution, and any Certificate evidencing Units which such successor corporation thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent for that purpose. All the Certificates 85
issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Agreement as the Certificates theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as though all of such Certificates had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In case of any such merger, consolidation, share exchange, sale, assignment, transfer, lease or conveyance such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Certificates evidencing Units thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate. SECTION 9.03. Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel Given to Purchase Contract Agent. The Purchase Contract Agent, subject to Sections 7.01 and 7.03, shall receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such merger, consolidation, share exchange, sale, assignment, transfer, lease or conveyance, and any such assumption, complies with the provisions of this Article and that all conditions precedent to the consummation of any such merger, consolidation, share exchange, sale, assignment, transfer, lease or conveyance have been met. ARTICLE 10 COVENANTS SECTION 10.01. Performance under Purchase Contracts. The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders from time to time of the Units that it will duly and punctually perform its obligations under the Purchase Contracts in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contracts and this Agreement. SECTION 10.02. Maintenance of Office or Agency.

The Company will give prompt written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. The Company initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Purchase Contract Agent as such office of the Company. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Purchase Contract Agent with the address thereof, such presentations, 86
surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office, and the Company hereby appoints the Purchase Contract Agent as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where Certificates may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. The Company hereby designates as the place of payment for the Units the Corporate Trust Office and appoints the Purchase Contract Agent at its Corporate Trust Office as paying agent in such city. SECTION 10.03. Company to Reserve Common Stock. The Company shall at all times prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable against tender of payment in respect of all Purchase Contracts constituting a part of the Units evidenced by Outstanding Certificates.

The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued against tender of payment in respect of any Purchase Contract constituting a part of the Outstanding Units will, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. SECTION 10.05. Statements of Officers of the Company as to Default. The Company will deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company (which as of the date hereof is December 31) ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate, stating whether or not to the knowledge of the signers thereof the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions hereof, and if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge. SECTION 10.06. ERISA. Each Holder from time to time of the Units that is a Plan or who used assets of a Plan to purchase Units hereby represents that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such Holder to acquire the Normal Units constitutes assets of the Plan or (ii) the purchase or holding of the Normal Units by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited 87
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4973 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable laws. SECTION 10.07. Tax Treatment. The Company covenants and agrees, and by purchasing a Normal Unit or Stripped Unit each Holder agrees, for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes, to (i) treat a Holder's acquisition of the Normal Units or Stripped Units as the acquisition of the Applicable Ownership Interest in Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, and Purchase Contracts constituting the Normal Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, (ii) treat each Holder as the owner of the applicable interest in the Collateral Account, including the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities and (iii) treat the Senior Notes as indebtedness of the Company.

(FORM OF REVERSE OF NORMAL UNIT CERTIFICATE) Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 23, 2003 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "PURCHASE CONTRACT AGREEMENT"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors hereunder, the "PURCHASE CONTRACT AGENT"), to which Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Normal Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount (the "PURCHASE PRICE"), a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate, unless an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to the Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part shall have occurred. The "SETTLEMENT RATE" is equal to: (1) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than or equal to $56.8750 (the "THRESHOLD APPRECIATION PRICE"), 0.8791 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; (2) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but greater than $45.5000 (the "REFERENCE PRICE"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contact having a value equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Adjusted Applicable Market Value, rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share; and (3) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Reference Price, 1.0989 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in Section 5.09 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, which is settled through Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Normal Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Settlement Rate (in the case of a Cash Merger Early Settlement). The "APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day A-7
immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date subject to adjustments set forth under Section 5.04 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. The "CLOSING PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means: (1) the closing sale price as of the close of the principal trading session (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") on such date; (2) if Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported Sale price) per share as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which Common Stock is so listed; (3) if Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last closing sale price per share as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.; (4) if Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or (5) if such bid price is not available, the market value of Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "TRADING DAY" means a day on which Common Stock (1) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market A-8
at the close of business and (2) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of Common Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Normal Units Certificate may pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or from the proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) or a Remarketing of the related Pledged Senior Notes. Unless the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of Normal Units, a Holder of Normal Units who (1) does not, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement, or who does so notify the Purchase Contract Agent but fails to make an effective Cash Settlement prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Early Settlement, shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the sale of the related Pledged Senior Notes held by the Collateral Agent unless the Holder has previously made a Cash Merger Early Settlement. Unless the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of Normal Units, such sale will be made by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement on the Final Remarketing Date. If the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of Normal Units, a Holder of Normal Units who does not notify the Purchase Contract Agent, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds at maturity of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as defined in clause (i) of the definition of such term). If, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, exercises its rights as a secured creditor with respect to the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and related Pledged Senior Notes related to this Normal Units Certificate, any accrued and unpaid interest on the Pledged Senior Notes attributable to such Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes will become payable by the Company to the holder of this Normal Units Certificate in the manner provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. A-9
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Senior Notes, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Senior Notes are entitled to vote or upon the solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Senior Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Normal Units Holders a notice: (1) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation; (2) stating that each Normal Units Holder on the record date set by the Purchase Contract Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Senior Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Purchase Contract Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes constituting a part of such Holder's Normal Units; and (3) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Normal Units Holders on such record date, received by the Purchase Contract Agent at least six days prior to such meeting, the Purchase Contract Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Normal Unit, the Purchase Contract Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Senior Notes underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes constituting a part of such Holder's Normal Unit. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, the Collateral Agent shall surrender the Pledged Senior Notes against delivery of an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Price of the Pledged Senior Notes and shall deposit funds in the Collateral Account in exchange for the Pledged Senior Notes. Thereafter, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Normal Units, the Treasury Portfolio and promptly (a) transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) to the Collateral Account to secure the obligations of each Holder of Normal Units to purchase shares of Common Stock A-10
under the Purchase Contracts constituting a part of such Normal Units, (b) transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of such term) to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders of such Normal Units and (c) remit the remaining portion of such funds to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of such Normal Units. Upon the occurrence of a Successful Remarketing of Senior Notes prior to the Final Remarketing Date, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent will apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Normal Units, the Treasury Portfolio, and, after deducting the Remarketing Fee to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, promptly remit the remaining portion of such proceeds of such Successful Remarketing to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of such Normal Units. Following the occurrence of (i) a Special Event Redemption prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or (ii) a Successful Remarketing of the Senior Notes prior to the Final Remarketing Date, the Holders of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Holder of Normal Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in Treasury Portfolio. The Normal Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Normal Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Normal Units Certificate will be registered and Normal Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. A Holder who elects to substitute a Treasury Security for Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, thereby creating 20 Stripped Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Normal Units remains in effect, such Normal Units shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Normal Units in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and Purchase Contracts constituting such Normal Units may be transferred and exchanged only as a Normal Unit. Unless the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of the Normal Units, and subject A-11
to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of Normal Units may substitute, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, for the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes securing such Holder's obligations under the related Purchase Contracts, Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes underlying the aggregate Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, each Unit for which such Pledged Treasury Securities secures the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "STRIPPED UNIT". A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in integral multiples of 20 Normal Units for 20 Stripped Units. If the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of the Normal Units, a Holder may, at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, but only in integral multiples of 12,500 Normal Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer Treasury Securities having an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the Normal Units for which such substitution is being made to the Collateral Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Normal Units Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in New York City. If the book-entry system for the Normal Units has been terminated, the Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Security Register, or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person by a prior written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent.

(REVERSE OF STRIPPED UNIT CERTIFICATE) Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 23, 2003 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "PURCHASE CONTRACT AGREEMENT") between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "PURCHASE CONTRACT AGENT"), to which the Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Stripped Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount (the "PURCHASE PRICE") a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate, unless an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to the Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part shall have occurred. The "SETTLEMENT RATE" is equal to: (1) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than or equal to $56.8750 (the "THRESHOLD APPRECIATION PRICE"), 0.8791 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; (2) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but greater than $45.5000 (the "REFERENCE PRICE"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contact having a value equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Adjusted Applicable Market Value, rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share; and (3) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Reference Price, 1.0989 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in Section 5.09 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, which is settled through Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Stripped Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Settlement Rate (in the case of a Cash Merger Early Settlement). The "APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day B-5
immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, subject to adjustments set forth under Section 5.04 hereof. The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. The "CLOSING PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means the: (1) closing sale price as of the close of the principal trading session (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") on such date; (2) if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported Sale price) per share as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed; (3) if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last closing sale price per share as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.; (4) if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or (5) if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. B-6
A "TRADING DAY" means a day on which the Common Stock (1) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (2) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Stripped Unit shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of the Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby either by effecting an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Cash Merger Early Settlement of each such Purchase Contract or by applying a principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Holder's Stripped Unit equal to the Stated Amount of such Purchase Contract to the purchase of the Common Stock. A Holder of Stripped Units who (1) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Early Settlement, or (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Cash Merger Early Settlement, shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the Pledged Treasury Securities. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Treasury Securities (as defined in the Pledge Agreement) forming a part of each Stripped Unit. A Stripped Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Proceeds of the Treasury Security forming a part of such Stripped Unit, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. The Stripped Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Stripped Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Stripped Units Certificate will be registered and Stripped Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the B-7
Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. A Holder who elects to substitute Senior Notes, for Treasury Securities, thereby recreating Normal Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses associated therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract underlying a Stripped Unit remains in effect, such Stripped Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Stripped Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract constituting such Stripped Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Stripped Unit. Unless the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of the Normal Units and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement, a Holder of Stripped Units may recreate, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Normal Units by delivering to the Securities Intermediary Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount, equal to the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of such Pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such substitution, the Holder's Units shall be referred to as a "NORMAL UNIT". Any such creation of Normal Units may be effected only in multiples of 20 Stripped Units for 20 Normal Units. If the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as a components of the Normal Units, a Holder may, at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, substitute the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for the Treasury Securities, but only in integral multiples of 12,500 Stripped Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer to the Collateral Agent the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio in an amount such that the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the portion of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) is equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Stripped Units, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder the Treasury Securities. The Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Stripped Units Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in New York City or, at the option of the Holder, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Security Register. B-8
Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early ("EARLY SETTLEMENT") as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contract evidenced by this Certificate, the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office an Election to Settle Early form set forth below duly completed and accompanied by payment in the form of immediately available funds payable to the order of the Company in an amount (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") equal to: (i) the product of (A) the Stated Amount times (B) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (ii) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts. Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Stripped Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to 0.8791 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT RATE"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted as provided in Section 5.04 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Merger, a Holder of Stripped Units may effect Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract underlying such Stripped Units pursuant to the terms of Section 5.04(b)(2) of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon Cash Merger Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Stripped Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Stripped Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement. Upon registration of transfer of this Stripped Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Stripped Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. B-9

In such an event, the Holder shall Transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Agent in an amount such that the Value of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) is equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Stripped Units, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release and transfer to the Holder the appropriate Treasury Securities in the manner set forth above. (b) Upon credit to the Collateral Account of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, or security entitlements with respect thereto delivered by a Holder of Stripped Units and receipt of the related instruction from the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary shall release such Pledged Treasury Securities and shall promptly Transfer the same to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, free and clear of the Pledge created hereby. SECTION 5.04. Termination Event. 16
(a) Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of written notice from the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent that a Termination Event has occurred, the Collateral Agent shall release all Collateral from the Pledge and shall promptly Transfer: (i) any Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and Pledged Senior Notes or security entitlements with respect thereto; (ii) any Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or security entitlements with respect thereto; (iii) any Pledged Treasury Securities, and (iv) any payments by Holders (or the Permitted Investments of such payments) pursuant to Section 5.05 hereof, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders for distribution to such Holders, in accordance with their respective interests, free and clear of the Pledge created hereby; provided, however, if any Holder shall be entitled to receive less than $1,000 with respect to its interest in the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), the Purchase Contract Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to dispose of such interest for cash and deliver to such Holder cash in lieu of delivering the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term). (b) If such Termination Event shall result from the Company's becoming a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, and if the Collateral Agent shall for any reason fail promptly to effectuate the release and Transfer of all Collateral and Proceeds of any of the foregoing, as the case may be, as provided by this Section 5.04, the Purchase Contract Agent shall: (i) use its best efforts to obtain an opinion of a nationally recognized law firm reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent to the effect that, notwithstanding the Company's being the debtor in such a bankruptcy case, the Collateral Agent will not be prohibited from releasing or Transferring the Collateral as provided in this Section 5.04, and shall deliver or cause to be delivered such opinion to the Collateral Agent within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event, and if (A) the Purchase Contract Agent shall be unable to obtain such opinion within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event or (B) the Collateral Agent shall continue, after delivery of such opinion, to refuse to effectuate the release and Transfer of all Collateral and Proceeds of any of 17
the foregoing, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 5.04, then the Purchase Contract Agent shall within fifteen days after the occurrence of such Termination Event commence an action or proceeding in the court having jurisdiction of the Company's case under the Bankruptcy Code seeking an order requiring the Collateral Agent to effectuate the release and transfer of all Collateral and Proceeds of any of the foregoing, or as the case may be, as provided by this Section 5.04; or (ii) commence an action or proceeding like that described in clause 5.04(b)(i) hereof within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event. SECTION 5.05. Cash Settlement.

A Holder of Normal Units may only affect a Cash Settlement in integral multiples of 20 Units. The Company shall instruct the Collateral Agent in writing 18
as to the type of Permitted Investments in which any such Cash shall be invested; provided, however, that if the Company fails to deliver such written instructions by 10:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the day such Cash is received by the Collateral Agent or to be reinvested by the Securities Intermediary, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to invest such Cash in the Permitted Investments described in clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments. In no event shall the Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary be liable for the selection of Permitted Investments or for investment losses incurred thereon. The Collateral Agent and Securities Intermediary shall have no liability in respect of losses incurred as a result of the failure of the Company to provide timely written investment direction. Upon receipt of the proceeds upon the maturity of the Permitted Investments on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall (A) instruct the Securities Intermediary to pay the portion of such proceeds and deliver any certified or cashier's checks received, in an aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price, to the Company on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, and (B) release any amounts in excess of the Purchase Price earned from such Permitted Investments to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder.

(c) As soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent a notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, stating (i) the amount of Cash that it has received with respect to the Cash Settlement of Normal Units, and (ii) the amount of Pledged Senior Notes to be remarketed in the Final Remarketing pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(iii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement. SECTION 5.06. Early Settlement and Cash Merger Early Settlement. Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of a notice from the Purchase Contract Agent that a Holder of Units has elected to effect either (i) Early Settlement of its obligations under the Purchase Contracts forming a part of such Units in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contracts and Section 5.07 of the Purchase Contract Agreement or (ii) Cash Merger Early Settlement of its obligations under the Purchase Contracts forming a part of such Units in 19
accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contracts and Section 5.04(b)(2) of the Purchase Contract Agreement (which notice shall set forth the number of such Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement), and that the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement and that all conditions to such Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, as the case may be, have been satisfied, then the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (1) the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes underlying such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, related to such Units in the case of a Holder of Normal Units or (2) Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of a Holder of Stripped Units, in each case with a Value equal to the product of (x) the Stated Amount times (y) the number of Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Senior Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the related Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in such Pledged Senior Notes) and Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby. A Holder of Units may settle early only in integral multiples of 20 Units; provided that a Holder of Normal Units, if the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of such Normal Units, may settle early only in integral multiples of 12,500 Normal Units. SECTION 5.07. Application of Proceeds in Settlement of Purchase Contracts. (a) If a Holder of Normal Units (if the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have not replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as components of such Normal Units) has not elected to make an effective Cash Settlement by notifying the Purchase Contract Agent in the manner provided for in Section 5.02(c)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement or does notify the Purchase Contract Agent as provided in paragraph 5.02(c)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement of its intention to pay the Purchase Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph 5.02(c)(ii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay 20
for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Purchase Contracts from the Proceeds of the Final Remarketing of the related Pledged Senior Notes. In such event, upon written direction from the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer the related Pledged Senior Notes to the Remarketing Agent for Final Remarketing. Upon receiving such Pledged Senior Notes, the Remarketing Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, will use its reasonable efforts to remarket such Pledged Senior Notes. The Remarketing Agent will deposit the Proceeds of such Final Remarketing (less, to the extent permitted by the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Fee) in the Collateral Account, and the Collateral Agent shall invest the Proceeds of the Final Remarketing in Permitted Investments set forth in clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments. On the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Purchase Contract Agent shall consult with the Collateral Agent regarding the instruction the Collateral Agent shall give to the Securities Intermediary in order to apply a portion of the Proceeds from such Final Remarketing equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Pledged Senior Notes to satisfy in full such Holder's obligations to pay the Purchase Price to purchase the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts and the balance of the Proceeds from the Final Remarketing, if any, that shall be transferred to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder. If the Remarketing Agent advises the Collateral Agent in writing that there has been a Failed Final Remarketing, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company shall, at the written direction of the Company, exercise the Company's rights as a secured party with respect to the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Pledged Senior Notes in accordance with applicable law or deliver the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Pledged Senior Notes to the Company to retain to the extent permitted by applicable law. Following such action, the Holder's obligations to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock will be deemed to be satisfied in full. (b) In the case of a Stripped Unit or a Normal Unit (if the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes as a component of the Normal Units), promptly after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall invest the Cash Proceeds of the maturing Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, in Permitted Investments set forth in clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments, unless prior to 10:30 a.m. (New York City time) on such date, the Company shall otherwise instruct the Collateral Agent in writing as to the type of Permitted Investments in which any such Cash Proceeds shall be invested. In no 21
event shall the Collateral Agent be liable for the selection of Permitted Investments or for investment losses incurred thereon. The Collateral Agent shall have no liability in respect of losses incurred as a result of the failure of the Company to provide timely written investment direction. Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder, the Collateral Agent shall apply the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, to the settlement of such Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. In the event the sum of the Proceeds from the related Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and the investment earnings from the investment in Permitted Investments exceeds the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchase Contracts being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to transfer such excess, when received, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder. (c) Prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, but no earlier than the Payment Date immediately preceding such date, Holders of Separate Senior Notes may elect to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed under the Remarketing Agreement, by delivering their Separate Senior Notes along with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto, to the Custodial Agent. After such time, such election shall become an irrevocable election to have such Separate Senior Notes remarketed in such Remarketing and, if such Remarketing fails, in any subsequent Remarketing. The Custodial Agent shall hold Separate Senior Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account in which the Pledged Securities shall be held. Holders of Separate Senior Notes electing to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw that election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto, prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Senior Notes to such Holder. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of the Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed and deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all Separate Senior Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to this Section 5.07(c) and not validly withdrawn prior to such date. In the event of a Successful Remarketing, after deducting the Remarketing Fee (to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement), the Remarketing Agent will remit to the Custodial Agent the remaining portion of the proceeds of such Remarketing for payment to the Holders of the remarketed Separate Senior Notes, in accordance with their respective interests. In the event of a Failed Remarketing, 22
the Remarketing Agent will promptly return such Separate Senior Notes to the Custodial Agent, and, in the event of a Failed Final Remarketing, the Custodial Agent shall deliver such Separate Senior Notes to the appropriate Holders. SECTION 5.08. Special Event Redemption. If the Collateral Agent receives written notice that a Special Event Redemption has occurred while Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes are still credited to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent shall apply the Redemption Amount to purchase the Treasury Portfolio, and the Collateral Agent shall credit the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) to the Collateral Account and shall transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (ii)(y) of the definition of such term) to the Purchase Contract Agent to hold on behalf of the Holders of Normal Units and distribute to the Holders of the Normal Units in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon credit to the Collateral Account of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) having a Value equal to the Value of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to release the Pledged Senior Notes from the Collateral Account and shall promptly transfer the Pledged Senior Notes to the Company. ARTICLE 6 VOTING RIGHTS - PLEDGED SENIOR NOTES SECTION 6.01. Voting Rights. Subject to the terms of Section 4.02 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent may exercise, or refrain from exercising, any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Senior Notes or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement; provided, that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not exercise or shall not refrain from exercising such right, as the case may be, if, in the judgment of the Purchase Contract Agent, such action would impair or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the value of all or any of the Pledged Senior Notes; and provided, further, that the Purchase Contract Agent shall give the Company and the Collateral Agent at least five Business Days' prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or its reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right. Upon receipt of any notices and other communications in respect of any Pledged Senior Notes, including notice of any meeting at which holders of the Pledged Senior Notes are entitled to vote or solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of the Senior Notes, the 23
Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to send promptly to the Purchase Contract Agent such notice or communication, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of a written request therefor from the Purchase Contract Agent, execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent such proxies and other instruments in respect of such Pledged Senior Notes (in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent) as are prepared by the Company and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent with respect to the Pledged Senior Notes. ARTICLE 7 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES SECTION 7.01. Rights and Remedies of the Collateral Agent.

Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, any and all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the UCC and the TRADES Regulations after default by a debtor, and as otherwise granted herein or under any other law.

The Purchase Contract Agent shall have no liability to any Holder for executing any documents or taking any such acts requested by the Collateral Agent hereunder, except for liability for its own grossly negligent acts, its own grossly negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct. SECTION 7.02. Special Event Redemption. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption while any Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Pledged Senior Notes are still credited to the Collateral Account, the Redemption Price shall be credited to the Collateral Account by the Collateral Agent upon receipt thereof from the Indenture Trustee, on or prior to 12:30 p.m., New York City time on such Special Event Redemption Date, by federal funds check or wire transfer of immediately available funds.

SECTION 7.07. Substitutions. Whenever a Holder has the right to substitute Treasury Securities, Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and related Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as defined in clause (i) of the definition of such term) or security entitlements for any of them, as the case may be, for financial assets held in the Collateral Account, such substitution shall not constitute a novation of the security interest created hereby.

The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall act as agent for the Company hereunder with such powers as are specifically vested in the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, by the terms of this Agreement. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary shall: 28
(a) have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be inferred from this Agreement against the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary, nor shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary be bound by the provisions of any agreement by any party hereto beyond the specific terms hereof; (b) not be responsible for any recitals contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by it under, this Agreement, the Units or the Purchase Contract Agreement, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement (other than as against the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be), the Units, any Collateral or the Purchase Contract Agreement or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Company or any other Person (except the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or for the perfection, priority or, except as expressly required hereby, maintenance of any security interest created hereunder; (c) not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder (except pursuant to directions furnished under Section 9.02 hereof, subject to Section 9.08 hereof); (d) not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct; and (e) not be required to advise any party as to selling or retaining, or taking or refraining from taking any action with respect to, any securities or other property deposited hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, during the term of this Agreement, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall take all reasonable action in connection with the safekeeping and preservation of the Collateral hereunder as determined by industry standards. No provision of this Agreement shall require the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder. In no event shall the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary be liable for any amount in excess of the Value of the Collateral. 29
SECTION 9.02. Instructions of the Company. The Company shall have the right, by one or more written instruments executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for the realization of any right or remedy available to the Collateral Agent, or of exercising any power conferred on the Collateral Agent, or to direct the taking or refraining from taking of any action authorized by this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) such direction shall not conflict with the provisions of any law or of this Agreement or involve the Collateral Agent in personal liability and (ii) the Collateral Agent shall be indemnified to its satisfaction as provided herein. Nothing contained in this Section 9.02 shall impair the right of the Collateral Agent in its discretion to take any action or omit to take any action which it deems proper and which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 9.03. Reliance by Collateral Agent and Securities Intermediary. Each of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon any certification, order, judgment, opinion, notice or other written communication (including, without limitation, any thereof by e-mail or similar electronic means, telecopy, telex or facsimile) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons (without being required to determine the correctness of any fact stated therein) and consult with and conclusively rely upon advice, opinions and statements of legal counsel and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with instructions given by the Company in accordance with this Agreement. SECTION 9.04. Certain Rights. (a) Whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Agreement the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action to be taken hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by one of the Company's officers, and delivered to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary and such certificate, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, shall be full warrant to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement upon the faith thereof. 30
(b) The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, entitlement order, approval or other paper or document. SECTION 9.05. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any corporation into which the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be the successor of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper with any party hereto or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto except where an instrument of transfer or assignment is required by law to effect such succession, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. SECTION 9.06. Rights in Other Capacities. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and their affiliates may (without having to account therefor to the Company) accept deposits from, lend money to, make their investments in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Purchase Contract Agent, any other Person interested herein and any Holder of Units (and any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) as if it were not acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and their affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Purchase Contract Agent and any Holder of Units without having to account for the same to the Company; provided that each of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent and the Collateral Agent covenants and agrees with the Company that it shall not accept, receive or permit there to be created in favor of itself and shall take no affirmative action to permit there to be created in favor of any other Person, any security interest, lien or other encumbrance of any kind in or upon the Collateral other than the lien created by the Pledge. SECTION 9.07. Non-Reliance on Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary. None of the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Units of this Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Units or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Units. None of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall have any duty or responsibility to provide the Company with any credit or other information 31
concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Units (or any of their respective affiliates) that may come into the possession of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective affiliates. SECTION 9.08. Compensation and Indemnity. The Company agrees to: (a) pay the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary from time to time such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, for all services rendered by them hereunder; (b) indemnify and hold harmless the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and each of their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the "INDEMNITEES"), harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) (collectively, "Losses" and individually, a "LOSS") that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, the Indemnitees or any of them for following any instructions or other directions upon which either the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary is entitled to rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, provided the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary has not acted with gross negligence or engaged in willful misconduct or bad faith with respect to the specific Loss against which indemnification is sought; and (c) in addition to and not in limitation of paragraph (b) immediately above, indemnify and hold the Indemnitees and each of them harmless from and against any and all Losses that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against, the Indemnitees or any of them in connection with or arising out of the Collateral Agent's, the Custodial Agent's or the Securities Intermediary's acceptance or performance of its powers and duties under this Agreement, provided the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary has not acted with gross negligence or engaged in willful misconduct or bad faith with respect to the specific Loss against which indemnification is sought. The provisions of this Section and Section 11.07 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary and the termination of this Agreement. SECTION 9.09. Failure to Act. In the event of any ambiguity in the provisions of this Agreement or any dispute between or conflicting claims by or among the parties hereto or any other Person with respect to any funds or property 32
deposited hereunder, then at its sole option, each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled, after prompt notice to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or instructions with respect to such property or funds so long as such dispute or conflict shall continue, and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall not be or become liable in any way to any of the parties hereto for its failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting claims, demands or instructions. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled to refuse to act until either: (a) such conflicting or adverse claims or demands shall have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or settled by agreement between the conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary; or (b) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall have received security or an indemnity satisfactory to it sufficient to save it harmless from and against any and all loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense which it may incur by reason of its acting. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may in addition elect to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or orders as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may deem necessary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, none of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be required to take any action that is in its opinion contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, or which would in its opinion subject it or any of its officers, employees or directors to liability. SECTION 9.10. Resignation of Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary. (a) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary as provided below: (i) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact for the Holders of Units; (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may be removed at any time by the Company; and 33
(iii) if the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder in any material respect for a period of not less than 20 days after receiving written notice of such failure by the Purchase Contract Agent and such failure shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may be removed by the Purchase Contract Agent, acting at the direction of the Holders of Units. The Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 9.10(a). Upon any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, which shall not be an Affiliate of the Purchase Contract Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's giving of notice of resignation or the Company's or the Purchase Contract Agent's giving notice of such removal, then the retiring or removed Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction, at the expense of the Company, for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall each be a bank or a national banking association which has an office (or an agency office) in New York City with a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, such successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall take all appropriate action, subject to payment of any amounts then due and payable to it hereunder, to transfer any money and property held by it hereunder (including the Collateral) to such successor. The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Article 9 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral 34
Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder, at a time when such Person is acting as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, Securities Intermediary or Custodial Agent, as the case may be. (b) Since JPMorgan Chase Bank is serving as the Collateral Agent hereunder and the Purchase Contract Agent under the Purchase Contract Agreement, if an event of default (other than an event of default occurring as a result of a Failed Final Remarketing) occurs hereunder or under the Purchase Contract Agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank will resign as the Collateral Agent, but continue to act as the Purchase Contract Agent. A successor Collateral Agent will be appointed in accordance with the terms hereof. SECTION 9.11. Right to Appoint Agent or Advisor. The Collateral Agent shall have the right to appoint agents or advisors in connection with any of its duties hereunder, and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by, or in reliance upon the advice of, such agents or advisors selected in good faith. The appointment of agents pursuant to this Section 9.11 shall be subject to prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. SECTION 9.12. Survival. The provisions of this Article 9 shall survive termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary. SECTION 9.13. Exculpation. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or their officers, directors, employees or agents be liable under this Agreement to any third party for indirect, special, punitive, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, lost profits, whether or not the likelihood of such loss or damage was known to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, or any of them and regardless of the form of action. 35
ARTICLE 10 AMENDMENT SECTION 10.01. Amendment Without Consent of Holders. Without the consent of any Holders, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent, at any time and from time to time, may amend this Agreement, in form satisfactory to the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent, to: (a) evidence the succession of another Person to the Company and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Company; (b) evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent, Securities Intermediary or Purchase Contract Agent; (c) add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders, or surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company, provided that such covenants or such surrender do not adversely affect the validity, perfection or priority of the Pledge created hereunder; or (d) cure any ambiguity (or formal defect), correct or supplement any provisions herein which may be inconsistent with any other such provisions herein, or make any other provisions with respect to such matters or questions arising under this Agreement, provided that such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders in any material respect.

With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the Purchase Contracts at the time outstanding, including without limitation the consent of the Holders obtained in connection with a tender or an exchange offer, by Act of such Holders delivered to the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, the Company, when duly authorized by a Board Resolution, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Custodial Agent may amend this Agreement for the purpose of modifying in any manner the provisions of this Agreement or the rights of the Holders in respect of the Units; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the unanimous consent of the Holders of each Outstanding Unit adversely affected thereby in any material respect: 36
(a) change the amount or type of Collateral underlying a Unit (except for the rights of holders of Normal Units to substitute the Treasury Securities for the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, or the rights of Holders of Stripped Units to substitute Applicable Ownership Interests in Senior Notes and the related Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as applicable, for the Pledged Treasury Securities), unless such change is not adverse to the Holders, impair the right of the Holder of any Unit to receive distributions on the underlying Collateral or otherwise adversely affect the Holder's rights in or to such Collateral; or (b) otherwise effect any action that would require the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Unit affected thereby pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement if such action were effected by a modification or amendment of the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement; or (c) reduce the percentage of Purchase Contracts the consent of whose Holders is required for the modification or amendment of the provisions of this Agreement; provided that if any amendment or proposal referred to above would adversely affect only the Normal Units or only the Stripped Units, then only the affected class of Holders as of the record date for the Holders entitled to vote thereon will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal, and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the consent of Holders of not less than a majority of such class; provided, further, that the unanimous consent of the Holders of each outstanding Purchase Contract of such class affected thereby shall be required to approve any amendment or proposal specified in clauses (a) through (c) above. It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. SECTION 10.03. Execution of Amendments. In executing any amendment permitted by this Article, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 of the Purchase Contract Agreement with respect to the Purchase Contract Agent) shall be fully authorized and protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement and that all conditions precedent, if any, to the execution and delivery of such amendment have been satisfied. The Collateral 37
Agent, Custodial Agent, Securities Intermediary and Purchase Contract Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which affects their own respective rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement or otherwise. SECTION 10.04. Effect of Amendments. Upon the execution of any amendment under this Article, this Agreement shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such amendment shall form a part of this Agreement for all purposes; and every Holder of Certificates theretofore or thereafter authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered under the Purchase Contract Agreement shall be bound thereby. SECTION 10.05. Reference of Amendments. Certificates authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered after the execution of any amendment pursuant to this Section may, and shall if required by the Collateral Agent or the Purchase Contract Agent, bear a notation in form approved by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent as to any matter provided for in such amendment. If the Company shall so determine, new Certificates so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Collateral Agent, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company, to any such amendment may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered by the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement in exchange for Certificates representing Outstanding Units. ARTICLE 11 MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 11.01. No Waiver. No failure on the part of the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. SECTION 11.02. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.

SECTION 11.05. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. SECTION 11.06. Severability.

hereto as nearly as may be possible and (ii) the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

(c) The representations and warranties of the Company contained herein shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the applicable Remarketing Date, and the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have performed in all material respects all covenants and agreements contained herein or in the Purchase Contract Agreement or Pledge Agreement to be performed on their part at or prior to such Remarketing Date. (d) The Company shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agent a certificate, dated the applicable Remarketing Date, of the Chief Executive Officer and the Treasurer satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent stating that: (1) no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, if any, or prohibiting the sale of the Remarketed Senior Notes is in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose are pending before or, to the knowledge of such officers, threatened by the Commission; (2) the representations and warranties of the Company in Section 3 are true and correct on and as of the applicable Remarketing Date and the Company has performed in all material respects all covenants and agreements contained herein to be performed on its part at or prior to such Remarketing Date; and (3) the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Remarketing Materials, as of their respective dates, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and the Prospectus did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Section 7. Indemnification. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Remarketing Agent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein. (b) The Remarketing Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus supplement, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein 11
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to subsection (a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Remarketing Agent. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 7 or Section 8 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. Section 8. Contribution. (a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of such indemnification, shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses as incurred (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand from the offering of the Remarketed Senior Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the statements 12
of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the one hand and the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the other hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a), the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the fees received by it under Section 4 exceeds the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (b) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Remarketing Agent and to each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Remarketing Agent under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. (c) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 7 and this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent or any person controlling the Remarketing Agent, or the Company, its officers or director or any controlling person of the Company, and the completion of the Remarketing. 13
Section 9. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agent. The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove the Remarketing Agent, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Depositary and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Depositary; provided, however, that no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects. In any such case, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement. Section 10. Dealing in Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketed Senior Notes, Normal Units, Stripped Units or any of the securities of the Company (together, the "SECURITIES"). The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. Section 11. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Senior Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement. 14
Section 12. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate (i) as to the Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 9 and (ii) on the earlier of (x) any Special Event Redemption Date and (y) the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the other provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it. Sections 7, 8 and 11 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent. Section 13. Notices. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and: (a) if to the Remarketing Agent, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, New York, New York, 10004, Attention: Don Hansen (Fax: 212-357-5505); (b) if to the Company, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Hartford Plaza, Hartford, Connecticut 06115-1900, Attention: General Counsel (Fax: 860-547-5714); and (c) if to the Purchase Contract Agent, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to JPMorgan Chase Bank, 4 New York Plaza, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Institutional Trust Services (Fax: 212-623-6167). Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof. Section 14. Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each party hereto and its respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (x) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the Remarketing Agent and the person or persons, if any, who control the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and (y) the indemnity agreement of the Remarketing Agent contained in Section 7(b) of this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of the Company's directors and officers who sign the Registration Statement, if any, and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other 15
than the persons referred to herein, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. Section 15. Survival. The respective indemnities, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Remarketing Agent contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive any Remarketing and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any person controlling any of them. Section 16. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. Section 17. Judicial Proceedings. (a) Each party hereto expressly accepts and irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Federal or New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Remarketed Senior Notes. To the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, each party hereto irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. (b) Each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that a judgment in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 17(a) brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party, subject to rights of appeal and may be enforced in the courts of the United States of America or the State of New York (or any other court the jurisdiction to which the Company is or may be subject) by a suit upon such judgment. Section 18. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and, if executed in more than one counterpart, the executed counterparts shall each be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Section 19. Headings. The headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement. Section 20. Severability. 16
If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or deemed to be or shall, in fact, be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable as applied in any particular case in any or all jurisdictions because it conflicts with any provisions of any constitution, statute, rule or public policy or for any other reason, then, to the extent permitted by law, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case, circumstance or jurisdiction, or of rendering any other provision or provisions of this Agreement invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. Section 21. Amendments. This Agreement may be amended by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. Each of the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent agrees that it will not enter into, cause or permit any amendment or modification of the Transaction Documents or any other instruments or agreements relating to the Senior Notes or the Normal Units that would in any way adversely affect the rights, duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent, without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent. Section 22. Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned or delegated to any other Person without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent. The rights and obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder may not be assigned or delegated to any other Person (other than an affiliate of the Remarketing Agent) without the prior written consent of the Company.

The Normal Units, the Purchase Contracts and the Senior Notes have been validly issued and constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms. 2. The shares of Common Stock to be issued and sold by the Company pursuant to the Purchase Contracts have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered against payment therefor in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Our opinion in paragraph 1 is subject to the effects of (1) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally, (2) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity) and (3) an implied covenant of good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing, and standards of materiality, and we express no opinion as to the priority status under the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Sections 101 - 1330, as amended) of the Senior Notes. The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, including the applicable 2
provisions of the Delaware Constitution and the reported cases interpreting those laws, as currently in effect, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other laws. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Form 8-K filed on May 30, 2003, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statements, and to the reference to our firm under the caption "Validity of the Equity Units" in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving such consent, we do not thereby concede that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Very truly yours, /s/ Debevoise & Plimpton 3
