THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. INVESTOR FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS INDEX OF SELECTED ITEMS
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. BASIS OF PRESENTATION DEFINITIONS AND PRESENTATION - ---------------------------- o All amounts are in millions, except for per share and ratio information. o Operating income is a non-GAAP measure representing net income, before the after-tax effect of net realized capital gains and losses. The Company believes that operating income provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing businesses because it excludes the effect of realized capital gains and losses, which tend to be highly variable. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. o The Company has included the non-GAAP measure operating income, before the impact of the 2003 asbestos reserve addition in these materials. The Company has provided this measure to enhance investor understanding of the financial performance of the Company's operating businesses by eliminating the effect of the 2003 asbestos reserve addition which relates solely to legacy businesses. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. o Certain operating and statistical measures have been incorporated herein to provide supplemental data that indicate trends in The Hartford's current business. These measures include sales, account value, insurance in-force and written premiums. Written premiums is a non-GAAP measure and represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued in a fiscal period. Management believes that this performance measure is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company's sale of property and casualty insurance products. Earned premiums is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. o The Hartford, along with others in the life insurance industry, uses underwriting ratios as measures of the group benefits segment's performance. The loss ratio is the ratio of total benefits and claims excluding buyouts to total premiums and other considerations excluding buyout premiums. The expense ratio is the ratio of other insurance expenses (including amortization of deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits) to total premiums and other considerations excluding buyout premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. o The Hartford, along with others in the property and casualty insurance industry, uses underwriting ratios as measures of performance. The loss ratio is the ratio of claims expense (exclusive of claim adjustment expenses) to earned premiums. The loss adjustment expense ratio represents the ratio of claim adjustment expenses to earned premiums. The expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses (amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, as well as other underwriting expenses, excluding bad debts expense) to earned premiums. The policyholder dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio, the loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe the related cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. The "catastrophe ratio" (a component of the loss ratio) represents the ratio of catastrophe losses to earned premiums. o Premium renewal retention is defined as renewal premium written in the current period divided by new and renewal premium written in the immediately preceding period. o Trust preferred securities represent company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely junior subordinated debentures. o Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") represents unrealized gain (loss) on securities, net of tax; net gain (loss) on cash-flow hedging instruments, net of tax; foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax; and minimum pension liability adjustment, net of tax. o Assets under management is an internal performance measure used by the Company because a significant portion of the Company's revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall, correspondingly, in the level of assets under management. o Investment yield, before- or after-tax, is calculated by dividing before- or after-tax, respectively, annualized net investment income (excluding net realized capital gains (losses)) by average invested assets at cost (fixed maturities at amortized cost). o Book value (including AOCI) is calculated by dividing equity including AOCI, net of tax, by common shares outstanding. Book value (excluding AOCI) is calculated by dividing equity excluding AOCI, net of tax, by common shares outstanding. o Life is organized into four reportable operating segments: Investment Products, Individual Life, Group Benefits and Corporate Owned Life Insurance ("COLI"). Life also includes, in an Other category, its international operations, which are located primarily in Japan and Brazil; realized capital gains and losses; corporate items not directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments, principally interest expense; and intersegment eliminations. o Property and Casualty includes North American and Other Operations. North American includes the combined underwriting results of the Business Insurance, Personal Lines, Specialty Commercial and Reinsurance segments. Other Operations includes the combined underwriting results of certain property and casualty insurance operations that have discontinued writing new business and the Company's asbestos and environmental exposures. Property & Casualty includes the combined underwriting results of North American and Other Operations along with income and expense items not directly allocated to the Company's property and casualty segments, such as net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, other expenses (including interest) and income taxes. o Corporate includes the capital raising and purchase accounting adjustment activities related to the June 27, 2000 acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Hartford Life, Inc. ("HLI") that the Company did not already own, as well as capital that has not been allocated to the Company's insurance subsidiaries. o Net realized capital gains and losses are not allocated to the segment level within Life and Property & Casualty. o Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods to conform to the September 30, 2003 presentation. o NM - Not meaningful, increases or decreases greater than 200%, or changes from a net gain to a net loss position, or vice versa. - i -
