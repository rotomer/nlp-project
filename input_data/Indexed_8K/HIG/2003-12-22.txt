Item 5. Other Events. On December 19, 2003, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. announced that it has agreed to a global settlement of all claims arising out of its historical insurance relationship with Mac Arthur Company and its subsidiary Western MacArthur Company. The agreement calls for The Hartford to pay $1.15 billion during the first quarter of 2004 in full and final satisfaction of all claims by Mac Arthur or asbestos claimants against Mac Arthur. The agreement is subject to several conditions, including bankruptcy court approval and the final confirmation of a bankruptcy plan of reorganization for Mac Arthur granting The Hartford a channeling injunction against any further direct or indirect liability for asbestos-related claims against Mac Arthur. Until all conditions have been met, all payments will be held in escrow, and thereafter will be paid into a bankruptcy trust for the benefit of present and future Mac Arthur asbestos claimants. The Hartford expects the settlement agreement to achieve full and complete finality for The Hartford with respect to all exposures related to Mac Arthur. The cost of the settlement will be funded from The Hartford's existing reserves. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
