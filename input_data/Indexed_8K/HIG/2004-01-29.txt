NEWS RELEASE [HARTFORD GRAPHIC] Date: January 28, 2004 For Release: Upon Receipt Contact(s): MEDIA INVESTORS Joshua King Hans Miller 860/547-2293 860/547-2751 joshua.king@thehartford.com hmiller@thehartford.com Cynthia Michener Mike Lesperance 860/547-5624 860/547-6781 cynthia.michener@thehartford.com michael.lesperance@ thehartford.com Earnings from the fourth quarter of 2003 are released THE HARTFORD REPORTS NET INCOME OF $454 MILLION, OR $1.59 PER DILUTED SHARE Records set in property-casualty and life operations; a 76 percent increase in net income from 2002 HARTFORD, CONN. - The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE: HIG), one of the nation's largest investment management and insurance companies, today reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2003, delivering net income per diluted share of $1.59, up 57 percent from $1.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net income increased 76 percent to $454 million in the current period from $258 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net realized capital gains totaled $29 million (after-tax) in the current quarter versus net realized capital losses of $38 million (after-tax) in the same period last year. Included in the net realized capital gains and losses are periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives of $8 million (after-tax) and $5 million (after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002, respectively. "The results we announced today cap a quarter and end a year with a company that is stronger, bigger, and better prepared for the road ahead than it was 12 months ago," said The Hartford's Chairman and CEO Ramani Ayer. "It was a record quarter on many fronts: record annuity sales, record mutual fund sales, record property-casualty operating income, solid combined ratios and written premiums for business insurance exceeding $1 billion for the first time ever. -more-
"Our story today is about more than a good quarter; it's about an extraordinary year in which our team took some hits, made some tough decisions and emerged with a balance sheet in much better shape. "Early in the year, our expense actions initiated a major process to improve our cost competitiveness. At the same time, the comprehensive ground-up study of our asbestos reserves addressed deteriorating trends in the asbestos environment. None of it was easy, but all of it was needed to position us for future profitable growth. "We ended the year by acquiring many of CNA's group benefits businesses, bolstering our team in key areas. We always said we would seize appropriate opportunities to widen the reach of our business, and the CNA deal is an example of our determination. "This has been an outstanding quarter and a great end to a pivotal year for the company. Excellent operating results, favorable equity markets and a strong business model allows us to look confidently toward a new year," Ayer added. BRIEF SUMMARY OF FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS The Hartford's operating income* rose 44 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. This result was driven by record operating income in both life and property-casualty operations. For the full year 2003, including a first quarter increase in asbestos reserves of $1.7 billion (after-tax), the company reported a net loss of $91 million compared to net income of $1.0 billion for the comparable period of 2002. Net realized capital gains totaled $191 million (after-tax) for the full year 2003, versus net realized capital losses of $234 million (after-tax) in 2002. Included in the net realized capital gains and losses are periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives of $29 million (after-tax) and $16 million (after-tax) in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Information regarding non-GAAP financial measures used in this release is provided in the Discussion of Non-GAAP Measures section below.

- In group benefits, fully insured sales, excluding buyouts, rose 43 percent; net income rose 14 percent over the fourth quarter of 2002; closed purchase of CNA group life and disability business on December 31, 2003; and - In individual life, sales were up 46 percent; net income increased 21 percent over the fourth quarter of 2002. The following table presents underwriting results for the business insurance, personal lines, specialty commercial, reinsurance and other operations segments of property-casualty while operating income is presented for life, including its segments and property-casualty and corporate operations. [1] Life allocates the net realized gains and losses from periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives to its segments. [2] Operating income includes the effect of periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives, after-tax. For GAAP reporting such effects are includes in net realized capital gains and losses. [3] Prior periods reflect reclassification of periodic net coupon settlement on non-qualifying derivatives from net investment income to net realized capital gains (losses). Operating income and operating income before the 2003 asbestos reserve addition are not calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America [4] (GAAP). Information regarding non-GAAP financial measures used in this release is provided in the Discussion on Non-GAAP Measures section of this release. The Hartford defines the following as "NM" or not meaningful: increases or decreases greater than 200%, or changes from a net gain to a net loss position, or vice versa. -more-
INVESTMENT PRODUCTS Favorable equity markets, coupled with strong sales and positive net flows resulting from excellent distribution and diverse product offerings, contributed to significantly higher operating income in the fourth quarter. Individual annuity net income increased 42 percent over the fourth quarter of 2002, to $111 million. Total annuity sales increased year-over-year in both the broker-dealer and bank distribution channels. Total individual annuity assets under management rose $9.2 billion since Sept. 30, 2003, to $97.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2003. Total investment products assets under management reached $146.5 billion, an 11 percent increase from $131.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2003. Fourth quarter sales of other investment products increased 109 percent from the same period last year, to $3.5 billion, driven by record retail mutual fund sales of $1.6 billion. This was up 44 percent and 96 percent over the third quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2002, respectively. Total institutional sales contributed almost $1.1 billion in the quarter. INDIVIDUAL LIFE Individual life reported strong operating income and accelerating top-line growth in the fourth quarter. Operating income was up 21 percent to $41 million in the quarter from the prior-year period, driven mostly by unusually low mortality rates. Sales increased 46 percent over the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in sales was driven in large measure by new products and increased traction from renewed marketing efforts for universal and whole life products which, combined, reached $37 million in sales, four times the sales for these products in the year-ago quarter. GROUP BENEFITS Net income growth was strong in the fourth quarter, up 14 percent from the prior year to $41 million, and up 8 percent from the third quarter of 2003. Strong underwriting and disciplined claims management were key drivers in this performance. Fully insured sales, excluding buyouts, were up 43 percent from the prior-year period to $93 million, primarily as a result of bolstered marketing and distribution efforts. Integration of the newly acquired group benefits businesses from CNA is on schedule. As the transaction closed on Dec. 31, 2003, there was no impact on the fourth quarter 2003 income statement from this acquisition. JAPAN With wider public awareness and expanding distribution, assets under management at Hartford Life K.K., The Hartford's Japan-based subsidiary, reached $6.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2003, with sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 53 percent increase over the year-ago quarter. On a U.S. GAAP basis, after less than three years of operation, the business in Japan achieved a profit for the third straight quarter. BUSINESS INSURANCE Favorable market conditions, mid single-digit written price increases and new business production drove written and earned premiums growth of 14 and 17 percent, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002. Margins for the business remain favorable. Total new -more-
business growth, which was particularly notable in middle market, added $1.0 billion to net written premiums for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003. This is up 17 percent over the comparable period in 2002. The combined ratio of 92.4, before catastrophe losses of 0.7 points during the quarter, was 2.6 points better than last year's results before catastrophe losses. PERSONAL LINES Key initiatives such as the new auto class plan, Dimensions, are on schedule and are the framework for future profitable growth in the agency portfolio. Agency channel written premiums, which grew 4 percent in the quarter compared to 2002, were slowed by a move to 6-month policies. In the fourth quarter, The Hartford's program with AARP increased compared to 2002, with written premiums higher by 11 percent. Not including catastrophe losses of 2.7 points, personal lines produced an overall combined ratio of 94.2, a 3.9 point improvement from the same quarter of 2002. SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL Written premiums in the four principal specialty product lines combined grew 16 percent year-over-year, though they were 21 percent lower on a sequential basis due to seasonality in the book of business. Market conditions remain strong for business written in most of these lines with softening in the property class. Not including 1.0 point of catastrophe losses in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2003, the combined ratio for specialty commercial improved to 92.5. This is 8.0 points better than the same quarter of 2002. INVESTMENTS Yield on average invested assets decreased from 6.1 percent to 5.7 percent (before-tax) and from 4.3 percent to 3.9 percent (after-tax) in the current quarter, compared to the prior-year quarter, as a result of investing in the low interest rate environment. Impairments of $55 million (before-tax) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2003, were down from $126 million (before-tax) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2002. This reflects improved credit markets. Included in the current quarter were $25 million (before-tax) of impairments related to the company's holdings of Parmalat SpA. FULL-YEAR RESULTS "Our diversified business model and industry-leading distribution platform, coupled with product enhancements, disciplined underwriting and claim management, helped our business to prosper in a rational insurance market and a favorable equity market in 2003," said Ayer. "To give some examples, in business insurance, we achieved 17 percent new business growth in the fourth quarter of 2003, and 17 percent new business growth for all of 2003. Our combined ratios in our North American property-casualty operations were under 100 in each quarter of the year, and net investment income improved in each quarter. We reported record-breaking -more-
variable annuity sales of $15.7 billion in 2003, 51 percent better than 2002, while maintaining The Hartford's position as the nation's leading seller of variable annuities based on retail sales," Ayer said. In addition, The Hartford generated $4.8 billion in retail mutual fund sales, equal to 2002; $3.4 billion in institutional sales, a record; and $1.4 billion in 401(k) sales, also a new record for the company. For the full year of 2003, The Hartford reported a net loss of $91 million, driven by the first quarter asbestos reserve increase, compared to net income of $1.0 billion in 2002. On a per share basis, net loss was $0.33 per diluted share, compared with net income of $3.97 per diluted share for 2002. For comparison, before the after-tax effect of the asbestos reserve addition, The Hartford's net income was $1.61 billion, or $5.87 per diluted share, in 2003. The company's operating income for the full year ended Dec. 31, 2003, before the after-tax effect of the asbestos reserve addition, was $1.45 billion, or $5.28 per diluted share, up from $1.25 billion, or $4.96 per diluted share, in 2002. The Hartford's 2003 full-year results include after-tax expenses of $40 million related to the settlement of the Bancorp Services, LLC litigation dispute, a $30 million federal tax benefit at Hartford Life, and an after-tax severance charge in property-casualty of $27 million. Operating income for 2002 included the following life operations items: a $76 million tax benefit and an $11 million after-tax expense related to the Bancorp Services litigation. Total revenues for 2003 increased by 14 percent to $18.73 billion, up from $16.42 billion in 2002. 2004 GUIDANCE Based on current information and, in particular, financial market performance in January, The Hartford now expects 2004 earnings per diluted share to be between $5.80 and $6.10. This estimate reflects current market levels but also assumes that U.S. equity markets end 2004 at levels 9 percent higher than beginning 2004 levels. The previous estimated 2004 range was $5.70 to $6.00 per fully diluted share. The company's revised 2004 estimate continues to assume no capital gains or losses other than periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives (though it is extremely likely that the company will have capital gains or losses during 2004). Among other factors, the revised outlook also incorporates the increased dilutive impact from outstanding equity unit securities as The Hartford's common stock price appreciates above $57 per share and the closing terms of the company's acquisition of CNA's group life and disability business and the associated common stock financing. It also incorporates the loss of approximately 10 cents per share of P&C investment income resulting from the $1.15 billion funding of the Mac Arthur settlement in the first quarter of 2004. Guidance with respect to 2004 is very likely to be adjusted in the future based on changes in market conditions affecting life and property-casualty operations. A large number of factors could cause these estimates to change, including significant changes in estimated future earnings on investment products caused by changes in the equity markets, catastrophe losses at levels in -more-
excess of expectations, and adverse developments emerging as a result of changes in estimates arising from the company's regular review of its loss reserves for all lines of insurance. CONFERENCE CALL The company will discuss the results of the fourth quarter and the 2004 guidance in the quarterly conference call on Jan. 29, 2004, at 11 a.m. EST. The call, along with a slide presentation, can be simultaneously accessed through the company's Web site at www.thehartford.com/ir/index.html. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES The Hartford uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because The Hartford's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing The Hartford's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. The Hartford uses operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Operating income is net income, before the after-tax effect of net realized capital gains and losses other than periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives. The company believes operating income provides to investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing businesses because it excludes the effect of those realized capital gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating income (loss) for the quarters and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 is set forth above. In this release, The Hartford has included the financial measure operating income, before the 2003 asbestos reserve addition. The Hartford has provided this financial measure to enhance investor understanding of the company's ongoing businesses by eliminating the effect of the asbestos reserve addition, which relates solely to legacy businesses. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating income, before the 2003 asbestos reserve addition for the quarters and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 is set forth above. Written premiums is a financial measure used by The Hartford as an important indicator of the operating performance of the company's property-casualty operations. Because written premiums represents the amount of premium charged for policies issued during a fiscal period, The Hartford believes it is useful to investors because it reflects current trends in The Hartford's sale of property-casualty insurance products. Earned premiums, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, represents all premiums that are recognized as revenues during a fiscal period. The difference between written premiums and earned premiums is attributable to the change in unearned premium reserves. More detailed financial information can be found in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for the fourth quarter of 2003, which is available on the company's Web site, www.thehartford.com. -more-

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) [1] The quarter ended September 30, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2003 include $40 of after-tax expense related to the settlement of the Bancorp Services, LLC litigation dispute. The quarter ended June 30, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2003 include $30 and the year ended December 31, 2002 includes $76 of tax benefit in Life primarily related to the favorable treatment of certain tax items arising during the 1996-2002 tax years. The quarter ended June 30, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2003 include $27, after-tax, of severance charges in Property & Casualty. The year ended December 31, 2002 includes $11 of after-tax expense in Life related to the Bancorp Services, LLC litigation dispute. [2] Includes mutual fund assets and third party assets managed by HIMCO. [3] As a result of the antidilutive impact from the net loss in the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2003, The Hartford is required by generally accepted accounting principles to use basic weighted average shares in the calculation of the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2003 diluted earnings per share. In the absence of the net loss, 256.1 and 274.2 weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares would have been used in the calculation for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively. [4] Calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares of 256.1 and 274.2 for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively.
