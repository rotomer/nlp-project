THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. INVESTOR FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. BASIS OF PRESENTATION DEFINITIONS AND PRESENTATION ---------------------------- o All amounts are in millions, except for per share and ratio information. o In the fourth quarter of 2003, The Hartford changed its reporting of earned income on non-qualifying derivatives. Earned income from periodic net coupon settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", previously reported in net investment income, have been included in net realized capital gains and losses. The reclassification has been made to prior periods presented. o On December 31, 2003, the Company acquired the group life and accident, and short-term and long-term disability businesses of CNA Financial Corporation. Accordingly, there was no impact to the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. o Operating income is a non-GAAP measure representing net income, before the after-tax effect of net realized capital gains and losses other than periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives. The Company believes that operating income provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing businesses because it excludes the effect of those realized capital gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. o The Company has included the non-GAAP measure operating income, before the impact of the 2003 asbestos reserve addition in these materials. The Company has provided this measure to enhance investor understanding of the financial performance of the Company's operating businesses by eliminating the effect of the 2003 asbestos reserve addition, which relates solely to legacy businesses. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. o The Company has included the non-GAAP measure operating income, before the impact of the 2003 asbestos reserve addition, Bancorp litigation, tax related items and severance charges, in its presentation of operating results by segment. The Company has provided this measure to enhance investor understanding of the financial performance of the Company's operating businesses by eliminating the effect of the Bancorp litigation, tax related items and severance charges because these items either are non-recurring or are highly variable from period to period. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. o Certain operating and statistical measures have been incorporated herein to provide supplemental data that indicate trends in The Hartford's current business. These measures include sales, account value, insurance in-force and written premiums. Written premiums is a non-GAAP measure and represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued in a fiscal period. Management believes that this performance measure is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company's sale of property and casualty insurance products. Earned premiums is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. o The Hartford, along with others in the life insurance industry, uses underwriting ratios as measures of the group benefits segment's performance. The loss ratio is the ratio of total benefits and claims excluding buyouts to total premiums and other considerations excluding buyout premiums. The expense ratio is the ratio of other insurance expenses (including amortization of deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits) to total premiums and other considerations excluding buyout premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. o The Hartford, along with others in the property and casualty insurance industry, uses underwriting ratios as measures of performance. The loss ratio is the ratio of claims expense (exclusive of claim adjustment expenses) to earned premiums. The loss adjustment expense ratio represents the ratio of claim adjustment expenses to earned premiums. The expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses (amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, as well as other underwriting expenses, excluding bad debt expense) to earned premiums. The policyholder dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio, the loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe the related cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. The catastrophe ratio (a component of the loss ratio) represents the ratio of catastrophe losses to earned premiums. - i -
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONT.) DEFINITIONS AND PRESENTATION (CONTINUED) - ---------------------------------------- o Premium renewal retention is defined as renewal premium written in the current period divided by premium written in the immediately preceding period. o The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003), an interpretation of ARB No. 51", in the fourth quarter of 2003. Regarding the Company's presentation of trust preferred securities, the trust preferred securities were deconsolidated and simultaneously an equivalent note payable representing the junior subordinated debentures was recognized as debt. o Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") represents unrealized gain (loss) on securities, net of tax; net gain (loss) on cash-flow hedging instruments, net of tax; foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax; and minimum pension liability adjustment, net of tax. o Assets under management is an internal performance measure used by the Company because a significant portion of the Company's revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall, correspondingly, in the level of assets under management. o Investment yield, before- or after-tax, is calculated by dividing before- or after-tax, respectively, annualized net investment income (excluding net realized capital gains (losses)) by average invested assets at cost (fixed maturities at amortized cost). o Book value per share (including AOCI) is calculated by dividing equity including AOCI, net of tax, by common shares outstanding. Book value per share (excluding AOCI) is calculated by dividing equity excluding AOCI, net of tax, by common shares outstanding. o Life is organized into four reportable operating segments: Investment Products, Individual Life, Group Benefits and Corporate Owned Life Insurance ("COLI"). Life also includes, in an Other category, its international operations, which are located primarily in Japan and Brazil; net realized capital gains and losses other than periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives; corporate items not directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments, principally interest expense; and intersegment eliminations. Periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives are reflected in the revenue section of each applicable segment in net realized capital gains and losses. o Property and Casualty includes North American and Other Operations. North American includes the combined underwriting results of the Business Insurance, Personal Lines, Specialty Commercial and Reinsurance segments. Other Operations includes the combined underwriting results of certain property and casualty insurance operations that have discontinued writing new business and the Company's asbestos and environmental exposures. Property & Casualty includes the combined underwriting results of North American and Other Operations along with income and expense items not directly allocated to the Company's property and casualty segments, such as net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, other expenses (including interest) and income taxes. o Corporate includes the capital raising and purchase accounting adjustment activities related to the June 27, 2000 acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Hartford Life, Inc. ("HLI") that the Company did not already own, as well as capital that has not been allocated to the Company's insurance subsidiaries. o Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods to conform to the December 31, 2003 presentation. o NM - Not meaningful means increases or decreases greater than 200%, or changes from a net gain to a net loss position, or vice versa. - ii -
