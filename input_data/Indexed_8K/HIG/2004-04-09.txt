Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. This Current Report on Form 8-K is filed on behalf of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("The Hartford" or the "Company") to provide supplemental financial disclosure relating to the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2003. A copy is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Hartford intends to change its reporting segments effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2004. The segment change is in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, and reflects the manner in which the Company is currently managing its businesses. The Company intends to reclassify its Property & Casualty doubtful accounts expense from underwriting expenses to other expenses. The Company also intends to report all debt and related interest expense in Corporate. The new segments and their component products are as follows: LIFE Retail Products Group: This segment will include the Company's individual annuities, retail mutual funds, 401(k) plans (formerly Corporate), 529 college savings plans, Canadian and offshore investment products. The Company is planning to continue to prepare a separate income statement in its financial supplement for the individual annuity line of business. Institutional Solutions Group: This segment will include Governmental products, institutional liability products, including structured settlements and institutional annuities (including terminal funding cases), as well as private placement life insurance owned by corporations (formerly reported as the Corporate Owned Life Insurance segment) and high net worth individuals. The Individual Life and Group Benefits segments remain unchanged from their definitions as of December 31, 2003. PROPERTY & CASUALTY Property & Casualty is now organized into four reportable operating segments: The underwriting segments of Business Insurance, Personal Lines, Specialty Commercial (collectively "Ongoing Operations") and the Other Operations segment. The Other Operations segment consists of certain property and casualty insurance operations of the Company which have discontinued writing new business and includes the financial results of the assumed reinsurance business previously reported in the Reinsurance segment. The Other Operations segment also includes substantially all of the Company's asbestos and environmental exposures. Property & Casualty will continue to include
income and expense items not directly allocated to the operating segments, such as net investment income, net realized gains and losses, other expenses and income taxes. Additionally, in order to better analyze the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance businesses, doubtful accounts expense, which had previously been included in underwriting results, will now be reported in other expenses. CORPORATE The debt and related interest expense that had previously been reflected in Life and Property & Casualty will now be reported in Corporate to better reflect the Company's central control of its capital management function. Life's and Property & Casualty's debt has been replaced with equity. As provided in General Instruction B.6 of Form 8-K, the information and exhibit contained in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall they be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. BASIS OF PRESENTATION CHANGES IN PRESENTATION - - Life is organized into four reportable operating segments: Retail Products Group, Institutional Solutions Group, Individual Life and Group Benefits. Life also includes, in an Other category, its international operations, which are located primarily in Japan and Brazil; net realized capital gains and losses other than periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives and net realized capital gains and losses related to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits; corporate items not directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments; and intersegment eliminations. Periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives and net realized capital gains and losses related to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits are reflected in each applicable segment in net realized capital gains and losses. - - Property and Casualty includes Ongoing Operations and Other Operations. Ongoing Operations includes the combined underwriting results of the Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial segments. Other Operations includes the combined underwriting results of certain property and casualty insurance operations that have discontinued writing new business (including the Company's assumed reinsurance business) and substantially all of the Company's asbestos and environmental exposures. Property & Casualty includes the combined underwriting results of Ongoing Operations and Other Operations along with income and expense items not directly allocated to the Company's property and casualty segments, such as net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, other expenses and income taxes. - - Underwriting results represent earned premiums less incurred claims, claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. Previously, the Company included doubtful accounts expense in its calculation of underwriting results. Doubtful accounts expense is now included in other expenses for all periods presented. - - Corporate includes all of the Company's debt financing and related interest expense, as well as certain capital raising and purchase accounting adjustment activities. DEFINITIONS AND PRESENTATION - - All amounts are in millions, except for per share and ratio information. - - In the fourth quarter of 2003, The Hartford changed its reporting of earned income on non-qualifying derivatives. Earned income from periodic net coupon settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", previously reported in net investment income, have been included in net realized capital gains and losses. The reclassification has been made to all periods presented. - - On December 31, 2003, the Company acquired the group life and accident, and short-term and long-term disability businesses of CNA Financial Corporation. Accordingly, there was no impact to the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. - - Operating income is a non-GAAP measure representing net income, before the after-tax effect of net realized capital gains and losses other than periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives and the cumulative effect of accounting changes. The Company believes that operating income provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing businesses because it excludes the effect of those realized capital gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. - - The Company has included the non-GAAP measure operating income, before the impact of the 2003 asbestos reserve addition, Bancorp litigation, tax related items, severance charges, restructuring charges and September 11, 2001, as applicable, in its presentation of operating results by segment. The Company has provided this measure to enhance investor understanding of the financial performance of the Company's operating businesses by eliminating the effect of the Bancorp litigation, tax related items, severance charges, restructuring charges and September 11, 2001 because these items either are non-recurring or are highly variable from period to period, and the effect of the 2003 asbestos reserve addition, because it relates solely to legacy business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. - - Certain operating and statistical measures have been incorporated herein to provide supplemental data that indicate trends in The Hartford's current business. These measures include sales, account value, insurance in-force and written premiums. Written premiums is a non-GAAP measure and represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued in a fiscal period. Management believes that this performance measure is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company's sale of property and casualty insurance products. The difference between written premiums and earned premiums is the change in unearned premium reserve. Earned premiums is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. - - The Hartford, along with others in the property and casualty insurance industry, uses underwriting ratios as measures of performance. The loss ratio is the ratio of claims expense (exclusive of claim adjustment expenses) to earned premiums. The loss adjustment expense ratio represents the ratio of claim adjustment expenses to earned premiums. The expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses (amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, as well as other underwriting expenses) to earned premiums. The policyholder dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio, the loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe the related cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. The catastrophe ratio (a component of the loss ratio) represents the ratio of catastrophe losses to earned premiums. i
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONT.) DEFINITIONS AND PRESENTATION (CONTINUED) - - The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003), an interpretation of ARB No. 51", in the fourth quarter of 2003. After applying these provisions to the Company's presentation of trust preferred securities, the trust preferred securities were deconsolidated and simultaneously an equivalent note payable representing the junior subordinated debentures was recognized as debt. - - Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") represents unrealized gain (loss) on securities, net of tax; net gain (loss) on cash-flow hedging instruments, net of tax; foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax; and minimum pension liability adjustment, net of tax. - - Assets under management is an internal performance measure used by the Company because a significant portion of the Company's revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall, correspondingly, in the level of assets under management. - - Book value per share (including AOCI) is calculated by dividing equity including AOCI, net of tax, by common shares outstanding. Book value per share (excluding AOCI) is calculated by dividing equity excluding AOCI, net of tax, by common shares outstanding. - - Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods to conform to current presentation. - - NM - Not meaningful means increases or decreases greater than 200%, or changes from a net gain to a net loss position, or vice versa. ii
