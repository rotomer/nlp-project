Earnings from the first quarter of 2004 are released - ---------------------------------------------------- The Hartford reports net income of $568 million, or $1.93 per diluted share Records set in property-casualty and life operations; a 25 percent increase in net income from the fourth quarter of 2003 HARTFORD, Conn. - The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE: HIG), one of the nation's largest financial services and insurance companies, today reported first quarter of 2004 net income per diluted share of $1.93, up from the loss of $5.46 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2003. Net income increased to $568 million in the current period from a loss in the first quarter of 2003 of $1.4 billion. Net realized capital gains, which are included in net income, totaled $95 million (after-tax) in the current quarter versus net realized capital losses of $29 million (after-tax) in the same period last year. "I am very pleased by the results we are posting today. Net income is approaching two dollars per diluted share, totaling $568 million in all. Our advances in operating income for our property-casualty and life operations, both year-over-year and sequentially, bode well for the coming year, in which we work toward continued profitable growth," said The Hartford's Chairman and CEO Ramani Ayer. - more -
The Hartford -- First Quarter 2004 Earnings/2 "Even excluding the reserve addition in the first quarter last year, the 47 percent increase in our operating income(1) compared to that quarter and the 16 percent increase from our record fourth quarter show that The Hartford continues to fire on all cylinders." "As a diversified financial services company, the roughly even contribution to our bottom line from both our property-casualty and life operations strengthens and differentiates us. This quarter, property-casualty operating income was $297 million and life operating income was $256 million. We're proud to point out that these are record numbers for both operations." "Beyond the bottom line, our property-casualty operations this quarter showed encouraging combined ratios and healthy advances in business insurance and personal lines new business." "On the life side, most observers of The Hartford will be impressed, as I am, with record total annuity sales of $4.7 billion and a 33 percent increase in variable annuity sales over the first quarter of 2003. This, combined with continued forward momentum for our group benefits, mutual funds, and 401(k) businesses translates to a satisfying quarter on nearly every front. And across the sea, too, our business in Japan continues to impress those who have tuned in to its growth." "It's an exciting time at The Hartford. In March, our official corporate partnership with the NCAA brought our rapidly growing mutual funds front and center on network television in a program that will continue throughout the year. At the same time, our distinctive campaign boosted the presence of The Hartford's long admired brand." "It's early in the year, to be sure, and in an uncertain time no one can foresee all that lies ahead, but looking at the numbers we have posted from the first three months of the year, we're encouraged for the months to come," Ayer added. Brief summary of first quarter results The Hartford's operating income rose to $501 million in the first quarter of 2004 from a loss in the first quarter of 2003. This result was driven by record operating income in both life and property-casualty operations. - ------------- (1) Operating income is not calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP"). Information regarding non-GAAP financial measures used in this release is provided in the Discussion of Non-GAAP Measures section below. - more -

The Hartford -- First Quarter 2004 Earnings/6 Retail Products Group This segment includes individual annuities, retail mutual funds, 401(k) and 529 college savings plans and specialty products. Favorable equity markets, coupled with strong sales and positive net flows resulting from excellent distribution and diverse product offerings, contributed to significantly higher operating income in the first quarter. Individual annuity operating income increased 58 percent over the first quarter of 2003, to $112 million. Total annuity sales increased year-over-year in both the broker-dealer and bank distribution channels. First quarter sales of retail mutual funds more than doubled from the same period last year to a record $1.9 billion. 401(k) sales in the quarter were 53 percent higher than the first quarter of 2003, while sales of 529 college savings plans/specialty reached the $100 million mark for the quarter, nearly triple the first quarter of last year. Total retail products group assets under management reached $129.9 billion, a 5 percent increase from $123.6 billion at December 31, 2003, and an increase of $37.7 billion, or 41 percent, from March 31, 2003. Institutional Solutions Group This segment includes institutional and governmental investment products and private placement life insurance products (formerly called COLI). Operating income of $29 million was down 6 percent from the first quarter of 2003, as growth in institutional and governmental was offset by declines in private placement life insurance. Individual Life Individual life reported solid operating income and top-line growth in the first quarter. Operating income was up 6 percent to $34 million in the quarter from the prior-year period. Sales increased 31 percent over the first quarter of 2003, the segment's best-ever first quarter sales results. The increase in sales was driven in large measure by new products and increased traction from renewed marketing efforts for universal and whole life products which, combined, accounted for $24 million in sales, up 118 percent from the year-ago quarter. Group Benefits Operating income growth was strong in the first quarter, up 38 percent from the prior year to $47 million. Strong underwriting and disciplined claims management were key drivers in this performance along with earnings from the CNA group benefits acquisition completed on December 31, 2003. The integration of the CNA business is ahead of plan. Fully insured sales, excluding buyouts, were up 54 percent from the prior-year period to $341 million, primarily as a result of bolstered marketing and distribution efforts. Japan With wider public awareness and expanding distribution, assets under management at Hartford Life Insurance K.K., The Hartford's Japan-based subsidiary, reached $8.1 billion at March 31, - more -
The Hartford -- First Quarter 2004 Earnings/7 2004, with sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter, a 105 percent increase over the year-ago quarter. The business in Japan achieved a profit for the fourth straight quarter (U.S. GAAP basis) in its fourth year of operations. Business Insurance Favorable market conditions, mid-single-digit price increases and new business production drove written premiums growth of 15 percent over the first quarter of 2003. Earned premium growth for the first quarter of 2004 was 16 percent over the first quarter of 2003. Margins for the business are favorable. Total new business growth, which was particularly notable in small commercial, added $290 million to net written premiums for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. This is up 11 percent over the comparable period in 2003. The combined ratio of 90.3 percent before property catastrophes and prior-year development was 4.3 points better than last year's results. Prior-period development included reserve releases for September 11 of $175 million and reserve strengthening primarily related to construction defect claims of $23 million. Personal Lines Key initiatives such as the new auto class plan, Dimensions, are on schedule and provide the platform for future profitable growth in the agency portfolio. In 2004, Dimensions has been expanded into our homeowners line. Agency channel written premiums grew 13 percent in the quarter compared to 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, The Hartford's program with AARP produced a 10 percent written premium increase compared to 2003. Before catastrophe losses and prior-year development, personal lines produced an overall combined ratio of 86.1 percent, a 5.2 point improvement over 2003. Specialty Commercial Written premiums in specialty commercial grew 5 percent year over year. Written premium growth was strong in professional liability, increasing 20 percent year over year. Specialty commercial results were impacted by a 14 percent reduction, year over year, in property, as market pricing softened and the segment maintained its underwriting discipline. This quarter, there were several factors affecting the reported combined ratio. First, earned premiums were reduced $90 million, reflecting a decrease in estimated earned premiums on retrospectively-rated policies. Second, catastrophe losses were lowered by a reduction in September 11 reserves of $116 million. And last, an increase in prior-period reserves primarily related to construction defect claims amounted to $167 million. Before catastrophes, prior-period loss development and the earned premium reduction, the combined ratio was 91.7 percent. Investments Net investment income yield on average invested assets decreased from 6.0 percent to 5.7 percent (before-tax) and from 4.2 percent to 3.9 percent (after-tax) in the current quarter, compared to the - more -
The Hartford -- First Quarter 2004 Earnings/8 prior-year quarter, as a result of investing new cash flows in the lower interest rate environment. Impairments of $14 million (before-tax) for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, were down from $89 million (before-tax) for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. This reflects improved credit markets. 2004 Guidance Based on current information and, in particular, financial market performance through April, The Hartford now expects 2004 earnings per diluted share to be between $6.30 and $6.60. This estimate reflects current market levels but also assumes that U.S. equity markets end 2004 at levels 9 percent higher than beginning 2004 levels. The previous estimated 2004 range was $5.80 to $6.10 per fully diluted share. The company's prior and revised 2004 guidance estimates exclude capital gains or losses (though the company has had, and is likely to continue to record, capital gains or losses during the balance of 2004) and the cumulative effect of accounting changes associated with the company's adoption of Statement of Position 03-1 "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts." Guidance with respect to 2004 is very likely to be adjusted in the future based on changes in market conditions affecting life and property-casualty operations. A large number of factors could cause these estimates to change, including significant changes in estimated future earnings on investment products caused by changes in the equity markets, changes in loss-cost trends in the ongoing property-casualty businesses, catastrophe losses at levels different from expectations, adverse developments emerging as a result of changes in estimates arising from the company's regular review of its prior-period loss reserves for all lines of insurance, or other unusual or unpredictable items. Conference Call The company will discuss the results of the first quarter and the 2004 guidance in the quarterly conference call on May 5, 2004, at 9:00 a.m. EST. The call, along with a slide presentation, can be simultaneously accessed through the company's Web site at www.thehartford.com/ir/index.html. Discussion of Non-GAAP Measures The Hartford uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because The Hartford's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors - more -
The Hartford -- First Quarter 2004 Earnings/9 should be careful when comparing The Hartford's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. The Hartford uses operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Operating income is net income, before the after-tax effect of net realized capital gains and losses other than periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives, and the cumulative effect of accounting changes. The company believes operating income provides to investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing businesses because it excludes the effect of those realized capital gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating income (loss) for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 is set forth above. In this release, The Hartford has included the financial measure operating income, before the 2003 asbestos reserve addition. The Hartford has provided this financial measure to enhance investor understanding of the company's ongoing businesses by eliminating the effect of the asbestos reserve addition, which relates solely to legacy businesses. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating income, before the 2003 asbestos reserve addition for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 is set forth above. Written premiums is a financial measure used by The Hartford as an important indicator of the operating performance of the company's property-casualty operations. Because written premiums represents the amount of premium charged for policies issued during a fiscal period, The Hartford believes it is useful to investors because it reflects current trends in The Hartford's sale of property-casualty insurance products. Earned premiums, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, represents all premiums that are recognized as revenues during a fiscal period. The difference between written premiums and earned premiums is attributable to the change in unearned premium reserves. More detailed financial information can be found in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for the first quarter of 2004, which is available on the company's Web site, www.thehartford.com. The Hartford is one of the nation's largest financial services and insurance companies, with 2003 revenues of $18.7 billion. As of March 31, 2004, The Hartford had total assets of $237.3 billion and stockholders' equity of $13.5 billion. The company is a leading provider of investment products, life insurance and group benefits; automobile and homeowners products; and business property-casualty insurance.
