     (f) Except as provided in Section 9, the purchase price of the shares of Stock as to which an Option is exercised shall be paid to the Company at the time of exercise either in cash, Stock already owned by the optionee, or a combination of the foregoing having a total Fair Market Value equal to the purchase price. The Committee shall determine acceptable methods for tendering Stock as payment upon exercise of an Option and may impose such limitations and prohibitions on the use of Stock for such purpose as it deems appropriate.
     (g) In case of a Key Employee's termination of employment with all Participating Companies, the following provisions shall apply:
            (i) If a Key Employee who has been granted an Option shall die before such Option has expired, his or her Option may be exercised in full by: (A) the person or persons to whom the Key Employee's rights under the Option pass by will, or if no such person has such right, by his or her executors or administrators; (B) his or her Transferee(s) (with respect to non-qualified Options); or (C) his or her Beneficiary designated pursuant to the Plan, at any time, or from time to time, within five years after the date of the Key Employee's death or within such other period, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify, but not later than the expiration date specified in Section 5(c) above. Any such Options not fully exercisable immediately prior to such optionee's death shall become fully exercisable upon such death unless the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall otherwise determine.
            (ii) If the Key Employee's employment with all Participating Companies terminates: (A) because of his or her Total Disability, or (B) solely in the case of a Key Employee with an original hire date with a Participating Company before January 1, 2002, because of his or her voluntary termination of employment due to Retirement; he or she may exercise his or her Options in full at any time, or from time to time, within five years after the date of the termination of his or her employment, or within such other period, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify, but not later than the expiration date specified in Section 5(c) above. Any such Options not fully exercisable immediately prior to such optionee's Total Disability or Retirement shall become fully exercisable upon such Total Disability or Retirement unless the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall otherwise determine.
            (iii) If the Key Employee shall be terminated for cause as determined by the Committee, all of such Key Employee's Options or Rights outstanding at the date of such termination (whether or not then exercisable) shall be canceled without further action by the Key Employee, the Committee or the Company coincident with the effective date of such termination.
            (iv) Except as provided in Section 5(g)(ii) or Section 9, if a Key Employee's employment terminates for any other reason (including a voluntary resignation), he or she may exercise his or her Options, to the extent that he or she shall have been entitled to do so at the date of the termination of his or her employment, at any time, or from time to time, within four months after the date of the termination of his or her employment, or within such other period, and subject to such terms and conditions, as the
 
Committee may specify, but not later than the expiration date specified in Section 5(c) above. All Options and Rights held by such Key Employee or any of his or her assigns that are not eligible to be exercised upon the date of such termination shall be canceled without further action by the Key Employee, the Committee or the Company coincident with the effective date of such termination.
     (h) Except as provided in this Section 5(h) or required by applicable law, no Option or Right granted under the Plan shall be transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. During the lifetime of the optionee, an Option or Right shall be exercisable only by the Key Employee or Director to whom the Option or Right is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all or a portion of a non-qualified Option may be transferred and assigned by such persons designated by the Committee, to such persons or groups of persons designated as permissible Transferees by the Committee, and upon such terms and conditions as the Committee may from time to time authorize and determine in its sole discretion.
     (i) Except as provided in Section 9, if a Director's service on the Board terminates for any reason, including without limitation, termination due to death, disability or retirement, such Director (or Beneficiary, in the event of death) may exercise any Option or Right granted to him or her only to the extent determined by the Committee as set forth in such Director's Award Document and/or any administrative rules or other terms and conditions adopted by the Committee from time to time applicable to such Option or Right granted to such Director.
     (j) With respect to an Incentive Stock Option, the Committee shall specify such terms and provisions as the Committee may determine to be necessary or desirable in order to qualify such Option as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
     (k) With respect to the exercisability and settlement of Rights:
            (i) Upon exercise of a Right, a Key Employee or Director shall be entitled, subject to such terms and conditions the Committee may specify, to receive upon exercise thereof all or a portion of the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value of a specified number of shares of Stock at the time of exercise, as determined by the Committee, over (B) a specified amount which shall not, subject to Section 5(d), be less than the Fair Market Value of such specified number of shares of Stock at the time the Right is granted. Upon exercise of a Right, payment of such excess shall be made as the Committee shall specify in cash, the issuance or transfer to the Key Employee or Director of whole shares of Stock with a Fair Market Value at such time equal to any excess, or a combination of cash and shares of Stock with a combined Fair Market Value at such time equal to any such excess, all as determined by the Committee. The Company will not issue a fractional share of Stock and, if a fractional share would otherwise be issuable, the Company shall pay cash equal to the Fair Market Value of the fractional share of Stock at such time.
            (ii) In the event of the exercise of such Right, the Company's obligation in
 
respect of any related Option or such portion thereof will be discharged by payment of the Right so exercised.
6. Performance Shares
     (a) Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall: (i) determine and designate from time to time those Key Employees or groups of Key Employees to whom Awards of Performance Shares are to be made, (ii) determine the performance period (the "Performance Period") and performance objectives (the "Performance Objectives") applicable to such Awards, (iii) determine whether to impose a restriction period (the "Restriction Period") following the completion of the Performance Period applicable to any Key Employees or groups of Key Employees, (iv) determine the form of settlement of a Performance Share, and (v) generally determine the terms and conditions of each such Award. At any date, each Performance Share shall have a value equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock at such date; provided that the Committee may limit the aggregate amount payable upon the settlement of any Award. The maximum award for any individual employee in any given year shall be 200,000 Performance Shares.
     (b) The Committee shall determine a Performance Period of not less than one nor more than five years. Performance Periods may overlap and Key Employees may participate simultaneously with respect to Performance Shares for which different Performance Periods are prescribed.
     (c) The Committee may impose a Restriction Period of any duration determined appropriate in its sole discretion, which shall apply immediately following the completion of the Performance Period to which it relates.
     (d) The Committee shall determine the Performance Objectives of Awards of Performance Shares. Performance Objectives may vary from Key Employee to Key Employee and between groups of Key Employees and shall be based upon one or more of the following objective criteria, as the Committee deems appropriate, which may be (i) determined solely by reference to the performance of the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company or any division or unit of any of the foregoing, or (ii) based on comparative performance of any one or more of the following relative to other entities: (A) earnings per share, (B) return on equity, (C) cash flow, (D) return on total capital, (E) return on assets, (F) economic value added, (G) increase in surplus, (H) reductions in operating expenses, (I) increases in operating margins, (J) earnings before income taxes and depreciation, (K) total shareholder return, (L) return on invested capital, (M) cost reductions and savings, (N) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), (O) pre-tax operating income, (P) productivity improvements, or (iii) a Key Employee's attainment of personal objectives with respect to any of the foregoing criteria or other criteria such as growth and profitability, customer satisfaction, leadership effectiveness, business development, negotiating transactions and sales or developing long term business goals. If during the course of a Performance Period there shall occur significant events which the
 
Committee expects to have a substantial effect on the applicable Performance Objectives during such period, the Committee may revise such Performance Objectives.
     (e) At the beginning of a Performance Period, the Committee shall determine for each Key Employee or group of Key Employees the number of Performance Shares or the percentage of Performance Shares which shall be paid to the Key Employee or member of the group of Key Employees following completion of the Performance Period or if later, following any applicable Restriction Period, if the applicable Performance Objectives are met in whole or in part.
     (f) If a Key Employee terminates service with all Participating Companies during a Performance Period or any applicable Restriction Period: (i) because of death, (ii) because of Total Disability, (iii) solely in the case of a Key Employee with an original hire date with a Participating Company before January 1, 2002, because of his or her voluntary termination of employment due to Retirement, or (iv) under other circumstances where the Committee in its sole discretion finds that a waiver would be in the best interests of the Company; that Key Employee may, as determined by the Committee, be entitled to payment in settlement of such Performance Shares at the end of the Performance Period or if later, at the end of any applicable Restriction Period, based upon the extent to which the Performance Objectives were satisfied at the end of such Performance Period and prorated for the portion of the Performance Period together with any applicable Restriction Period during which the Key Employee was actively employed by any Participating Company; provided, however, the Committee may provide for an earlier payment in settlement of such Performance Shares in such amount and under such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate or desirable. If a Key Employee terminates service with all Participating Companies during a Performance Period or any applicable Restriction Period for any other reason, then such Key Employee shall not be entitled to any Award with respect to that Performance Period and/or Restriction Period unless the Committee shall otherwise determine.
     (g) Each Award of a Performance Share shall be paid in whole shares of Stock, or cash, or a combination of Stock and cash either as a lump sum payment or in annual installments, all as the Committee shall determine, with payment to commence as soon as practicable after the end of the relevant Performance Period or if later, at the end of any applicable Restriction Period.
     (h) Except as otherwise required by applicable law, no Performance Share granted under the Plan shall be transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution.
 
7. Restricted Stock and Restricted Units
     (a) Except as provided in Section 9, Restricted Stock and Restricted Units shall be subject to a Restriction Period specified by the Committee. The Committee may provide for the lapse of a Restriction Period in installments where deemed appropriate, and it may also require the achievement of predetermined performance objectives in order for such Restriction Period to lapse. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or as specified by the Committee, certificates for shares related to an award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Units shall be delivered to a Key Employee or Director as soon as administratively practicable following the end of the applicable Restriction Period.
     (b) Except when the Committee determines otherwise pursuant to Section 7(d), if a Key Employee terminates employment with all Participating Companies for any reason before the expiration of the Restriction Period, all shares of Restricted Stock and all rights with respect to any award of Restricted Units still subject to restriction shall be forfeited by the Key Employee and shall be reacquired by the Company.
     (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7 or required by applicable law, no shares of Restricted Stock received by a Key Employee or Director and no rights conveyed by an award of Restricted Units shall be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of during the Restriction Period.
     (d) In the event that a Key Employee's employment terminates due to: (i) death, (ii) Total Disability, (iii) solely in the case of a Key Employee with an original hire date with a Participating Company before January 1, 2002, a voluntary termination of employment due to Retirement, or (iv) such other circumstances that the Committee finds that a waiver of the applicable restrictions (or any portion thereof) would be in the best interests of the Company, any or all remaining restrictions (or the designated portion thereof) with respect to such Key Employee's Restricted Stock or Restricted Units shall lapse upon the date of such termination.
     (e) Except as provided in Section 9, if a Director's service on the Board terminates for any reason, including without limitation due to death, disability or retirement, prior to the lapse of any applicable Restriction Period, such Director (or Beneficiary, in the event of death) shall be or become vested in, or entitled to payment in respect of, such Award to the extent determined by the Committee as set forth in such Director's Award Document and/or any administrative rules or other terms and conditions adopted by the Committee from time to time applicable to such Award granted to such Director.
     (f) The Committee may require, on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate or desirable, that the certificates for Stock delivered under the Plan in respect of any grant of Restricted Stock may be held in custody by a bank or other institution, or that the Company may itself hold such shares in custody until the Restriction Period expires or until restrictions thereon otherwise lapse, or later as provided in Section 14 hereof. The Committee may require, as a condition of any Award of Restricted Stock that the Key Employee shall have delivered a stock power endorsed in blank relating to the Restricted
 
Stock.
     (g) At the discretion of the Committee, the Restricted Unit account of a Key Employee or Director may be credited with Dividend Equivalents during the Restricted Period which shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (and become payable and be paid) as the Restricted Units to which they relate. Unless the Committee shall otherwise determine at or after grant, all Dividend Equivalents payable in respect of Restricted Units shall be deemed reinvested in that number of Restricted Units determined based on the Fair Market Value on the date the corresponding dividend on the Stock is payable to stockholders.
     (h) Nothing in this Section 7 shall preclude a Key Employee from exchanging any shares of Restricted Stock subject to the restrictions contained herein for any other shares of Stock that are similarly restricted.
     (i) Subject to Section 7(f) and Section 8, each Key Employee or Director awarded Restricted Stock under the Plan shall be issued a certificate for the shares of Stock. Such certificate shall be registered in the name of the Key Employee or Director, and shall bear an appropriate legend reciting the terms, conditions and restrictions, if any, applicable to such Award and shall be subject to appropriate stop-transfer orders. Upon the lapse of the Restricted Period with respect to Restricted Stock, such shares shall no longer be subject to the restrictions imposed under this Section 7 and the Company shall issue or have issued new share certificates without the legend referred to herein in exchange for those certificates previously issued. Upon the lapse of the Restricted Period with respect to any Restricted Units, the Company shall deliver to the Key Employee or Director (or, if applicable, his or her beneficiary or permitted assigns, one share of Stock for each Restricted Unit as to which restrictions have lapsed (including any such Restricted Units related to any Dividend Equivalents credited with respect to such Restricted Units). The Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay cash or part cash and part Stock in lieu of delivering only Stock for Restricted Units. If a cash payment is made in lieu of delivering Stock, the amount of such cash payment for each share of Stock to which a Key Employee or Director is entitled shall be equal to the Fair Market Value on the date on which the Restricted Period lapsed with respect to the related Restricted Unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may require or permit the deferral of payment in respect of Restricted Units to a date or dates (including, without limitation, the date the Key Employee's employment or a Director's services on the Board terminates) subsequent to the date that the Restriction Period lapses on such terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the manner in which the amounts payable shall be deemed invested during the period of deferral) as it shall determine from time to time.
     (j) Except for the restrictions set forth herein and unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Key Employee or Director shall have all the rights of a shareholder with respect to such shares of Restricted Stock, including but not limited to, the right to vote and the right to receive dividends. A Key Employee or Director shall not have any right, in respect of Restricted Units awarded pursuant to the Plan, to vote on any matter submitted to the Company's stockholders until such time, if at all, as the shares of Stock attributable to such Restricted Units have been issued.
 
     (k) In addition, the Committee may permit Key Employees and Directors or any group of Key Employees and Directors to elect to receive Restricted Units in exchange for or in lieu of other compensation (including salaries, annual bonuses, annual retainer and meeting fees) that would otherwise have been payable to such Key Employees or Directors in cash. The Committee shall establish the terms and conditions of any such Restricted Units, including the Restriction Period applicable thereto, and the date on which Stock shall be issued in respect thereof. The Committee shall establish the terms and conditions applicable to any election by a Director to receive Restricted Units (including the time at which any such election shall be made).
8. Certificates for Awards of Stock
     (a) The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates for shares of Stock prior to: (i) the listing of such shares on any stock exchange on which the Stock may then be listed, (ii) the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law, or any ruling or regulation of any government body which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable, and (iii) the satisfaction of any tax withholding obligations as provided in Section 14 hereof.
     (b) All certificates for shares of Stock delivered under the Plan shall also be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Stock is then listed and any applicable federal or state securities laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. In making such determination, the Committee may rely upon an opinion of counsel for the Company.
     (c) Except to the extent such shares are subject to forfeiture during any applicable Restriction Period, each Key Employee or Director who receives Stock in settlement of or as part of an Award, shall have all of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such shares, including the right to vote the shares and receive dividends and other distributions. No Key Employee or Director awarded an Option, a Right, a Restricted Unit or a Performance Share shall have any right as a shareholder with respect to any shares of Stock covered by his or her Option, Right, Restricted Unit or Performance Share prior to the date of issuance to him or her of a certificate or certificates for such shares.
9. Change of Control
     (a) For purposes of this Plan, a Change of Control shall occur if:
           (i) a report on Schedule 13D shall be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Act disclosing that any Person, other than the Company or a subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan sponsored
 
by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company is the Beneficial Owner of twenty percent or more of the outstanding stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company;
           (ii) any Person other than the Company or a subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company shall purchase shares pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer to acquire any stock of the Company (or securities convertible into stock) for cash, securities or any other consideration, provided that after consummation of the offer, the Person in question is the Beneficial Owner of fifteen percent or more of the outstanding stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company (calculated as provided in paragraph (d) of Rule 13d-3 under the Act in the case of rights to acquire stock);
           (iii) any merger, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization of the Company approved by the stockholders of the Company shall be consummated, other than any such transaction immediately following which the persons who were the Beneficial Owners of the outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such transaction are the Beneficial Owners of at least 55% of the total voting power represented by the securities of the entity surviving such transaction entitled to vote in the election of directors of such entity (or the ultimate parent of such entity) in substantially the same relative proportions as their ownership of the securities of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such transaction; provided that, such continuity of ownership (and preservation of relative voting power) shall be deemed to be satisfied if the failure to meet such threshold (or to preserve such relative voting power) is due solely to the acquisition of voting securities by an employee benefit plan of the Company, such surviving entity or any subsidiary of such surviving entity;
           (iv) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all the assets of the Company approved by the stockholders of the Company shall be consummated; or
           (v) within any 24 month period, the persons who were directors of the Company immediately before the beginning of such period (the "Incumbent Directors") shall cease (for any reason other than death) to constitute at least a majority of the Board or the board of directors of any successor to the Company, provided that any director who was not a director at the beginning of such period shall be deemed to be an Incumbent Director if such director (A) was elected to the Board by, or on the recommendation of or with the approval of, at least two-thirds of the directors who then qualified as Incumbent Directors either actually or by prior operation of this clause (v), and (B) was not designated by a Person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Section 9(a)(iii) or Section 9(a)(iv) of the Plan.
     (b) For purposes of this Plan, a Potential Change of Control shall occur if:
           (i) A Person shall commence a tender offer, which if successfully
 
consummated, would result in such Person being the Beneficial Owner of at least 15% of the stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company;
           (ii) The Company enters into an agreement, the consummation of which would constitute a Change of Control;
           (iii) Solicitation of proxies for the election of directors of the Company by anyone other than the Company, which, if such directors were elected, would result in the occurrence of a Change of Control as described in Section 9(a)(v); or
           (iv) Any other event shall occur which is deemed to be a Potential Change of Control by the Board, the Committee, or any other appropriate committee of the Board in its sole discretion.
     (c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control:
           (i) Each Option and related Right outstanding on the date such Change of Control occurs, and which is not then fully vested and exercisable, shall immediately vest and become exercisable to the full extent of the original grant for the remainder of its term.
           (ii) The surviving or resulting corporation may, in its discretion, provide for the assumption or replacement of each outstanding Option and related Right granted under the Plan on terms which are no less favorable to the optionee than those applicable to the Options and Rights immediately prior to the Change of Control. If the surviving or resulting corporation offers to assume or replace the Options and Rights, the optionee may elect to have his or her Options and Rights assumed or replaced, in whole or in part, or to surrender on the date the Change of Control occurs his or her Options and Rights, in whole or in part, for cash equal to the excess of the Formula Price over the exercise price.
           (iii) In the event the successor corporation does not offer to assume or replace the outstanding Options and Rights as described in Section 9(b)(ii) hereof, each Option and Right will be exercised on the date such Change of Control occurs for cash equal to the excess of the Formula Price over the exercise price.
           (iv) The restrictions applicable to shares of Restricted Stock or to Restricted Units held by Key Employees pursuant to Section 7 shall lapse upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, and such Key Employees shall be entitled to elect, at any time during the 60 calendar days following such Change of Control, to receive immediately after the date the Key Employee makes such election either of the following: (A) unrestricted certificates for all of such shares, or (B) a lump sum cash amount equal to the number of such shares multiplied by the Formula Price. If a Key Employee does not make any election during the foregoing 60 day period, such Key Employee shall be deemed to have made the election described in Section 9(b)(vi)(A) as of the 60th day of such period, and unrestricted certificates shall be issued to such Key Employee immediately following such day as described in Section 9(b)(vi)(A) hereof.
 
           (v) If a Change of Control occurs during the course of a Performance Period or any Restriction Period applicable to an Award of Performance Shares pursuant to Section 6, then a Key Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the Performance Objectives and to have completed any applicable Restriction Period effective on the date of such occurrence. Such Key Employee shall be paid, immediately following the occurrence of such Change of Control, a lump sum cash amount equal to the number of outstanding Performance Shares awarded to such Key Employee multiplied by the Formula Price.
     (d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, in the event of a Change of Control as described in Section 9(b)(iii) or Section 9(b)(iv) of the Plan, in the case of an awardee whose employment or service involuntarily terminates on or after the date of a shareholder approval described in either of such Sections but before the date of a consummation described in either of such Sections, the date of termination of such an awardee's employment or service shall be deemed for purposes of the Plan to be the day following the date of the applicable consummation.
10. Beneficiary
     (a) Each Key Employee, Director and/or his or her Transferee may file with the Company a written designation of one or more persons as the Beneficiary who shall be entitled to receive the Award, if any, payable under the Plan upon his or her death. A Key Employee, Director or Transferee may from time to time revoke or change his or her Beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior Beneficiary by filing a new designation with the Company. The last such designation received by the Company shall be controlling; provided, however, that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Company prior to the Key Employee's, Director's or Transferee's death, as the case may be, and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt.
     (b) If no such Beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of death of a Key Employee, Director or Transferee, as the case may be, or if no designated Beneficiary survives the Key Employee, Director or Transferee or if such designation conflicts with applicable law, the estate of the Key Employee, Director or Transferee, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive the Award, if any, payable under the Plan upon his or her death. If the Committee is in doubt as to the right of any person to receive such Award, the Company may retain such Award, without liability for any interest thereon, until the Committee determines the rights thereto, or the Company may pay such Award into any court of appropriate jurisdiction and such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liability of the Company therefor.
 
11. Administration of the Plan
     (a) All decisions, determinations or actions of the Committee made or taken pursuant to grants of authority under the Plan shall be made or taken in the sole discretion of the Committee and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons for all purposes.
     (b) The Committee shall have full power, discretion and authority to interpret, construe and administer the Plan and any part thereof, and its interpretations and constructions thereof and actions taken thereunder shall be, except as otherwise determined by the Board, final, conclusive and binding on all persons for all purposes.
     (c) The Committee's decisions and determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made selectively among Key Employees and Directors, whether or not such Key Employees and Directors are similarly situated.
     (d) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, delegate such of its powers as it deems appropriate to the Company's Executive Vice President, Human Resources (or other person holding a similar position) or the Company's Chief Executive Officer, except that Awards to executive officers shall be made, and matters related thereto shall be determined, solely by the Committee or the Board or any other appropriate committee of the Board.
12. Amendment, Extension or Termination
     The Board or the Committee may, at any time, amend or modify the Plan and, specifically, may make such modifications to the Plan as it deems necessary to avoid the application of Section 162(m) of the Code and the Treasury regulations issued thereunder. However: (i) with respect only to Incentive Stock Options, no amendment shall, without approval by a majority of the Company's stockholders, (A) alter the group of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, or (B) except as provided in Section 13 increase the maximum number of shares of Stock which are available for Awards under the Plan; or, (ii) with respect to all Options, allow the Committee to reprice the Options. The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time without the consent of such person. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Plan shall not be amended, modified, suspended or terminated during the period in which a Change of Control is threatened. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a Change of Control shall be deemed to be threatened for the period beginning on the date of any Potential Change of Control, and ending upon the earlier of: (I) the second anniversary of the date of such Potential Change of Control, (II) the date a Change of Control occurs, or (III) the date the Board or the Committee determines in good faith that a Change of Control is no longer threatened. Further, notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, no amendment, modification, suspension or termination following a Change of Control shall adversely impair or reduce the rights of any person with respect to a prior Award without the consent of such person.
 
13. Adjustments in Event of Change in Common Stock
     In the event of any reorganization, merger, recapitalization, consolidation, liquidation, stock dividend, stock split, reclassification, combination of shares, rights offering, split-up or extraordinary dividend (including a spin-off) or divestiture, or any other change in the corporate structure or shares, the Committee may make such adjustment in the Stock subject to Awards, including Stock subject to purchase by an Option or issuable in respect of Restricted Units, or the terms, conditions or restrictions on Stock or Awards, including the price payable upon the exercise of such Option and the number of shares subject to Restricted Stock or Restricted Unit Awards, as the Committee deems equitable.
14. Miscellaneous
     (a) If a Change of Control has not occurred and if the Committee determines that a Key Employee has taken action inimical to the best interests of any Participating Company, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, terminate in whole or in part such portion of any Option (including any related Right) as has not yet become exercisable at the time of termination, terminate any Performance Share Award for which the Performance Period or any applicable Restriction Period has not been completed or terminate any Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Units for which the Restriction Period has not lapsed.
     (b) Except as provided in Section 9, nothing in this Plan or any Award granted hereunder shall confer upon any employee any right to continue in the employ of any Participating Company or interfere in any way with the right of any Participating Company to terminate his or her employment at any time. No Award payable under the Plan shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan or other arrangement of any Participating Company for the benefit of its employees unless the Company shall determine otherwise. No Key Employee shall have any claim to an Award until it is actually granted under the Plan. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as provided in Section 7(e) with respect to Restricted Stock.
     (c) The Committee shall have the right to make such provisions as deemed appropriate in its sole discretion to satisfy any obligation of the Company to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of the operation of the Plan or an Award under the Plan, including but not limited to at any time: (i) requiring a Key Employee to submit payment to the Company for such taxes before making settlement of any Award of Stock or other amount due under the Plan, (ii) withholding such taxes from wages or other amounts due to the Key Employee before making settlement of any Award of Stock or other amount due under the Plan, (iii) making settlement of any Award of Stock or other amount due under the Plan to a Key Employee part in Stock and part in cash to facilitate satisfaction
 
of such withholding obligations, or (iv) receiving Stock already owned by, or withholding Stock otherwise due to, the Key Employee in an amount determined necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, any Key Employee who is an executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 16 of the Act) shall have the right to satisfy his or her obligations to the Company pursuant to this Section 14(c) by instructing the Company not to deliver to the Key Employee Stock otherwise deliverable to the Key Employee in an amount sufficient to satisfy such obligations to the Company.
     (d) The Plan and the grant of Awards shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations and to such approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required.
     (e) The terms of the Plan shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
     (f) Captions preceding the sections hereof are inserted solely as a matter of convenience and in no way define or limit the scope or intent of any provision hereof.
15. Effective Date, Term of Plan and Shareholder Approval
     The effective date of the Plan shall be May 18, 2000. No Award shall be granted under this Plan after the Plan's termination date. The Plan's termination date shall be the earlier of: (a) May 18, 2010, or (b) the date on which the Maximum Limit (as defined in Section 3 of the Plan) is reached; provided, however, that the Plan will continue in effect for existing Awards as long as any such Award is outstanding.
