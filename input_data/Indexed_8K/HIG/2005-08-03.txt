ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K includes information about The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.'s results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. reported that, on August 2, 2005, a nationally known credit ratings agency inadvertently made available to its subscribers for a limited period a report about The Hartford. The report included non-public information about two reserve studies that were completed in the second quarter of 2005. The Hartford is making the following disclosure in order to provide all of the company's investors with information about the two studies. The credit ratings agency report included information about two comprehensive studies on business reported in The Hartford's "other operations" segment. First, the annual, ground-up asbestos review resulted in no addition to the company's asbestos reserves. Second, the company also completed a review of reserves related to HartRe's assumed reinsurance business, which is in runoff. This study resulted in a reserve increase of $73 million, pre-tax, primarily for U.S. casualty assumed reinsurance written during the 1997-2001 period. As previously announced, The Hartford will release its second quarter 2005 earnings results Thursday, August 4, 2005, at approximately 4:30 p.m. EDT. The company's conference call to discuss its results will take place Friday, August 5, 2005, at 10 a.m. EDT and will be simultaneously Webcast at www.thehartford.com/ir.
