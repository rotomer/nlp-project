Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 21, 2005, the Compensation and Personnel Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Company") approved modifications to The Hartford 1995 Incentive Stock Plan, The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan and The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan. These modifications will be effective with respect to all outstanding awards previously granted under such plans and all awards granted in the future. The modifications are intended to eliminate a potential ambiguity relating to the accounting treatment of the Companys equity-based awards under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which becomes effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2006. The modifications provide that, in the event of a Change of Control (all capitalized terms used herein have the meanings provided in the applicable plan unless otherwise indicated), awards under the p lans will be settled in the form of shares, unless the Committee, in its sole discretion, provides any of the following either absolutely or subject to the election of the award holder: (A) each Option and Right shall be surrendered or exercised for an immediate lump sum cash amount equal to the excess of the Formula Price over the exercise price; and (B) each Restricted Stock, Restricted Unit and Award of Performance Shares shall be exchanged for an immediate lump sum cash amount equal to the number of outstanding units or shares multiplied by the Formula Price. Previously, in the event of a Change of Control and under certain circumstances, award holders either would have received an automatic cash settlement of their plan awards or would have had the option to elect to receive cash settlement of their plan awards. Copies of modified versions of The Hartford 1995 Incentive Stock Plan, The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan and The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan will be provided as exhibits to the C ompanys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2005.
