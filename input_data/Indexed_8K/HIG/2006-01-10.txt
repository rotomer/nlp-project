Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
This Current Report on Form 8-K is filed on behalf of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("The Hartford" or the "Company") to provide supplemental financial disclosure relating to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003; and the nine month period ended September 30, 2005.
The Hartford intends to change its reporting segments effective for the quarter ending December 31, 2005. The segment change is in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, and reflects the manner in which the Company is currently organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance.
The new segments and their component products are as follows:
Life
Retail Products Group: This segment will include the Company's individual annuities, retail mutual funds, 529 college savings plans, Canadian and offshore investment products. The Company intends to continue to prepare a separate income statement in its financial supplement for the individual annuity line of business.
Retirement Plans: This segment will include the Company's retirement plan products and services to corporations and municipalities under Section 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans.
Institutional Solutions Group: This segment will include institutional liability products, including structured settlements and institutional annuities (including terminal funding cases), as well as variable private placement life insurance owned by corporations and high net worth individuals.
The Individual Life and Group Benefits segments remain unchanged from their definitions as of September 30, 2005.
International: This segment, which primarily has operations located in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the UK, provides investments, retirement savings and other insurance products to individuals and groups outside the United States and Canada. The Company intends to prepare a separate income statement in its financial supplement for the Japanese operations.
Life includes in an Other category its leveraged corporate owned life insurance product line of business; corporate items not directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments; net realized capital gains and losses on sales generated from movements in interest rates, less amortization of those gains or losses back to the reportable segments; net realized capital gains and losses generated from credit related events, less a credit risk fee charged to the reportable segments; net realized capital gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative strategies (including embedded derivatives) other than the net

periodic coupon settlements on credit derivatives and the net periodic coupon settlements on the cross currency swap used to economically hedge currency and interest rate risk generated from sales of the Company's yen based fixed annuity, which are allocated to the reportable segments; the mark-to-market adjustment for the equity securities held for trading reported in net investment income and the related change in interest credited reported as a component of benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses since these items are not considered by the Company's chief operating decision maker in evaluating the International results of operations; and intersegment eliminations.
Property & Casualty
Property & Casualty is organized into four reportable operating segments: The underwriting segments of Business Insurance, Personal Lines, Specialty Commercial (collectively "Ongoing Operations") and the Other Operations segment. The component products of each segment remain unchanged from September 30, 2005.
The profitability of the Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial segments will continue to be evaluated primarily based on underwriting results. The Company will now allocate income and expense items not directly attributed to the underwriting segments, such as net investment income, net realized gains and losses, other expenses and income taxes, to Ongoing Operations and Other Operations, respectively. The profitability of Ongoing Operations and the Other Operations segment will now be evaluated based on net income.
Additionally, effective for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company changed its method for calculating workers' compensation premium to be consistent with the method followed for the rest of the Company's property & casualty business. This change had no effect on earned premium. For all periods presented, written premium for workers' compensation business has been adjusted to reflect written premium in the period the policies incept. Previously, written premiums for most workers' compensation policies were calculated based on the period the premiums were billed.
Corporate
Corporate remains unchanged from its definition as of September 30, 2005.
