Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On August 10, 2006, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Initial Remarketing Agreement (the "Agreement") with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as remarketing agents (the "Remarketing Agents"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as purchase contract agent and attorney-in-fact of the holders of equity units, relating to the Company's 4.1% senior notes due November 16, 2008 (the "Senior Notes"), originally issued as part of equity units issued by the Company in September 2002. The Agreement was entered into in connection with the remarketing of, and the reset of the interest rate on, the Senior Notes by the Remarketing Agents as required under the terms of the equity units.
     The Agreement provides, among other things, that the Remarketing Agents agree to use their reasonable efforts to remarket the Senior Notes tendered or deemed tendered to the Remarketing Agents at a price equal to approximately 100.50% of the purchase price of a specified portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities to be substituted for the Senior Notes as a component of the equity units (the "Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price"). For this service, and for other services rendered in connection with the remarketing, the Remarketing Agents are entitled to a remarketing fee which will be equal to the lesser of 0.25% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price and the amount of the proceeds of the remarketing in excess of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the remarketing of the Senior Notes. The Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company. It also provides that the Company will indemnify the Remarketing Agents against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, arising out of or in connection with the Remarketing Agents' duties under the Agreement, and contribute to payments the Remarketing Agents may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
     Certain of the Remarketing Agents and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for the Company or its subsidiaries, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.
     The foregoing description of the material terms of the Agreement is qualified by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Remarketing Agents for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agents in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent through the Representative specifically for use therein.
provided
however
     (b) Each Remarketing Agent, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent through the Representative specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to subsection (a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior
 
written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 or Section 10 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     Section 10.
Contribution.
     (a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 9 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of such indemnification, shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses as incurred (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other hand from the offering of the Remarketed Senior Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other hand in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agents on the one hand and the fee paid to the Remarketing Agents on the other hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the fees received by it under Section 4 exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to
pro rata
 
pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     (b) The obligations of the Company under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of each Remarketing Agent and to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of each Remarketing Agent under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which such Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
     (c) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 9 and this Section 10 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or any person controlling any Remarketing Agent, or the Company, its officers or directors or any controlling person of the Company, and the completion of the Remarketing.
     Section 11.

. Termination.
     (a) If this Agreement is terminated, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any liability to any Remarketing Agent and no Remarketing Agent shall be under any liability to the Company, except that if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agents because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse each Remarketing Agent for all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including fifty percent (50%) of the reasonable fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it in connection with the Initial Remarketing. Sections 9, 10 and 12 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
     (b) In the event of a Failed Remarketing, this Agreement shall terminate and the Original Remarketing Agreement shall be deemed to be in full force and effect. Sections 9, 10 and 12 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

ANNEX A-1
     1. Each of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity); that upon the occurrence of a Termination Event (as defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement), the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.  101-1330, as amended) should not substantively limit the provisions of Sections 3.15 and 5.06 of the Purchase Contract Agreement or Section 5.04 of the Pledge Agreement that require termination of the purchase contracts and release of the Collateral Agent's security interest in (1) the Senior Notes, (2) the Treasury Securities (as defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement) or (3) the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of such term as defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement), as applicable, and the transfer of such securities to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders (as defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement) of the Units (as defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement), that no opinion is expressed as to whether a court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction might issue a temporary restraining order or provide other interim relief that would delay the exercise of such termination right for a period of time pending final adjudication of any challenge to the exercise of such right during a bankruptcy case involving the Company. In addition, applicable state laws and interpretations may affect the validity or enforceability of certain remedies provided for in the Pledge Agreement, but such limitations do not, in our opinion, make the remedies provided for therein inadequate for the practical realization of the rights and benefits intended to be provided thereby (subject to the other qualifications expressed in this letter).
provided, however,
provided further, however,
     2. The Senior Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the Senior Notes have been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and are valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity).

Company and, assuming the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity).
     4. The Initial Remarketing Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the Initial Remarketing Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Remarketing Agents and by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact for Holders of Purchase Contracts, is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity).
     5. The statements made in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Remarketed Senior Notes" and "Description of the Debt Securities", together with, in the case of the Preliminary Prospectus, the information in the Final Term Sheet, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions in the Indenture, the Senior Notes or legal matters referred to therein, are accurate in all material respects.
     6. The discussion under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, insofar as such discussion purports to summarize certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Remarketed Senior Notes, or state legal conclusions with respect thereto, is accurate in all material respects.
     The opinions set forth above are subject to the following additional limitations and qualifications:

ANNEX A-2
     Neal S. Wolin, Esq., Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the Company, shall have furnished to you his written opinion, dated the Remarketing Settlement Date, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that:
 
In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph (3), I have assumed that the consideration required by the resolutions of the board of directors of the Company authorizing the issuance of all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company has been received in full by the Company.
The opinions set forth in paragraphs (6) and (7) as to the performance by the Company of its obligations in accordance with the Transaction Documents are based solely upon the facts and circumstances as they exist on the date hereof and are rendered as if the Company had performed such obligations on the date hereof.
I am a member of the bar of the State of Connecticut and I do not hold myself out as conversant with, or express any opinion herein concerning, the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Connecticut, the DGCL and the Federal laws of the United States of America.
The opinions expressed herein are solely for your benefit and, without my prior written consent, neither my opinions nor this opinion letter may be disclosed to or relied upon by any other person. This opinion letter is limited to, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond, the matters expressly stated herein. The opinions expressed herein are rendered only as of the date hereof, and I assume no responsibility to advise you of facts, circumstances, changes of law, or other events or developments that hereafter may occur or be brought to my attention and that may alter or modify the opinions expressed herein.
