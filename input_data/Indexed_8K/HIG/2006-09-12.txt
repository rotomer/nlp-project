The Compensation and Personnel Committee (the "Committee") of the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Employment Agreement Amendments on July 20, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Companys named executive officers were Ramani Ayer, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Thomas M. Marra, Executive Vice President; David K. Zwiener, Executive Vice President; David M. Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Neal S. Wolin, Executive Vice President and General Co unsel.

Elimination of Change of Control benefits following a potential Change of Control. Provisions providing Change of Control benefits, following an actual Change of Control, to a named executive officer who was involuntarily terminated while the Change of Control was pending, have been eliminated.

The period during which Change of Control protections remain in force to benefit t he named executive officer has been reduced from three years to two years following a Change of Control.  Elimination of "Vested Benefits Enhancement." Provisions crediting the named executive officer with additional retirement benefits in the event of involuntary Termination Without Cause prior to a Change of Control, or in the event of involuntary Termination Without Cause or Termination For Good Reason following a Change of Control, have been eliminated, effective for terminations occurring on or after July 1, 2009. AMENDMENTS TO KEY EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Certain key executive officers (each, a "key executive officer") of the Company have also voluntarily executed revised Key Executive Employment Protection Agreements (the "KEEPA Agreements"), that replace the form of agreement previously entered into by key executive officers and the Company, which effect the changes substantially described below. The Committee of the Companys Board of Directors also authorized these revisions to the KEEPA Agreements on July 20, 2006. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined below shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the applicable agreement or Company benefit plan. KEEPA Agreement revisions:  Elimination of Change of Control benefits following a potential Change of Control. Provisions providing Change of Control benefits, following an actual Change of Control, to a key executive officer who was involuntarily terminated or who terminated for good reason while the Change of Control was pending, have been eliminated.

The period during which Change of Control protections remain in force to benefit the key executive officer has been reduced from three years to two years following a Change of Control.  Elimination of "Vested Benefits Enhancement."

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to continue to employ Executive and Executive hereby agrees to continue his employment by the Company.
(a)
Agreement to Employ
.
Except as otherwise provided below, the Company shall employ Executive for the period commencing on the Commencement Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Commencement Date. At the expiration of the original term or any extended term (each a "Renewal Date"), Executive's employment hereunder shall be extended automatically, upon the same terms and conditions, for successive one-year periods, unless either party shall give written notice to the other of its intention not to renew such employment at least fifteen months prior to such Renewal Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the term of this Agreement shall be extended automatically without any action by either party until the second anniversary of such Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if not previously terminated pursuant to Sections 1(b), 5(a) or 6(a), the term of this Agreement shall terminate on the last day of the month in which Executive attains age 65, and such a termination upon Executive reaching age 65 shall be deemed to be a Termination Due to Retirement for purposes of this Agreement. The period during which Executive is employed pursuant to this Agreement, including any extension thereof in accordance with this Section 1(b), shall be referred to as the "Employment Period."

During the Employment Period, Executive shall have the duties, responsibilities and obligations customarily assigned to individuals serving in the position or positions in which Executive serves hereunder and such other duties, responsibilities and obligations as the Board shall from time to time specify.

During the Employment Period, Executive shall comply with the Code of Conduct of the Company. Unless and to the extent inconsistent with the terms of any published Company policy or code of conduct as in effect on the date hereof and as hereafter amended, nothing contained herein shall preclude Executive from (a) serving on the board of directors of any business corporation with the consent of the Board, (b) serving on the board of, or working for, any charitable or community organization, or (c) pursuing his personal financial and legal affairs, so long as the foregoing activities, individually or collectively, do not interfere with the performance of Executive's duties hereunder or violate any of the provisions of Section 9 hereof.

The Board or the appropriate committee of the Board may in its discretion periodically review Executive's base salary in light of competitive practices, the base salaries paid to other executive officers of the Company and the performance of Executive and the Company and its applicable affiliates, and may, in its discretion, increase such base salary by an amount it determines to be appropriate. Any such increase shall not reduce or limit any other obligation of the Company hereunder.

Executive's annual bonus opportunity shall not be reduced following any Change of Control, but may be reduced prior to a Change of Control solely pursuant to a cost-saving plan or structural realignment of total compensation elements that includes all senior executives and only to the extent that such reduction is proportionate to the reductions applicable to other senior executives. Executive's annual bonus opportunity, as it may be increased or reduced from time to time as provided herein, shall be referred to herein as "Target Bonus." The actual bonus, if any, payable for any such year shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the Company's Annual Executive Bonus Program or any successor annual incentive plan (the "Annual Plan") based upon the performance of the Company and/or its applicable affiliates and/or Executive against target objectives established under such Annual Plan. Subject to Executive's election to defer all or a portion of any annual bonus payable hereunder pursuant to the terms of any deferred compensation or savings plan or arrangement maintained or established by the Company or its affiliates, any annual bonus payable under this Section 3(b) shall be paid to Executive in accordance with the terms of the Annual Plan.

Certain Further Payments by Company
.
In the event that any amount or benefit paid or distributed to Executive pursuant to this Agreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or distributed to Executive by the Company or any affiliate (collectively, the "Covered Payments"), are or become subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed, the Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified in this Section an additional amount (the "Tax Reimbursement Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive with respect to such Covered Payments, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Covered Payments and any Federal, state and local income tax and other tax on the Tax Reimbursement Payment provided for by this Section, but before deduction for any Federal, state or local income or employment tax withholding on such Covered Payments, shall be equal to the amount of the Covered Payments.
(i)
Tax Reimbursement Payment

For purposes of determining whether any of the Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax,
(ii)
Applicable Rules
.
such Covered Payments will be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to the Effective Date or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants"), the Company has a reasonable basis to conclude that such Covered Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments" or represent reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base amount," or such "parachute payments" are otherwise not subject to such Excise Tax, and
(A)
the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
(B)
For purposes of determining the amount of the Tax Reimbursement Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay: (A) Federal income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of Federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, and (B) any applicable state and local income and other taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in Federal incomes taxes which could be obtained from the deduction of such state or local taxes if paid in such year.
(iii)
Additional Rules
.
(iv)
Repayment or Additional Payment in Certain Circumstances
.
In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Tax Reimbursement Payment made, Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of such prior Tax Reimbursement Payment that would not have been paid if such lesser Excise Tax had been applied in initially calculating such Tax Reimbursement Payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Tax Reimbursement Payment to be repaid to the Company has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax authority, repayment thereof shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to Executive by the applicable tax authority. Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expenses thereof) if Executive's good faith claim for refund or credit is denied.
(A)
Repayment
.
In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Tax Reimbursement Payment is made (including, but not limited to, by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Tax Reimbursement Payment), the Company shall make an additional Tax Reimbursement Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalty payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
(B)
Additional Tax Reimbursement Payment
.
The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) provided for in this Section 6 shall be paid to Executive not later than 10 business days following the payment of the Covered Payments; provided, however, that if the amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) cannot be finally determined on or before the date on which payment is due, the Company shall pay to Executive by such date an amount estimated in good faith by the Accountants to be the minimum amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment and shall pay the remainder of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later than 45 calendar days after payment of the related Covered Payment. To the extent that the amount of the estimated Tax Reimbursement Payment exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, Executive shall repay such excess to the Company on the fifth business day after written demand by the Company for payment.

Vested Benefits and Equity Awards shall be paid no later than the time for payment Determined Under the Applicable Plan except as otherwise expressly superseded or modified by this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely for purposes of amounts payable pursuant to Section 5 hereof, if any amount payable to Executive pursuant to Section 5 would be nondeductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Code if paid in the year of Executive's termination, the Company shall have the option of paying such nondeductible amount, with interest at the one-year treasury bill rate as in effect on the date of such termination as reported in the Wall Street Journal, on the first day of the second calendar quarter in the year following such termination.
8. 
Full Discharge of Company Obligations
.
Except as expressly provided in the last sentence of this Section 8, the amounts payable to Executive pursuant to Section 5 following termination of his employment (including amounts payable with respect to Vested Benefits) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of Executive's rights under Section 5 of this Agreement and any other claims he may have in respect of his employment by the Company or any of its affiliates. Such amounts shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any and all such rights and claims and, upon Executive's receipt of such amounts, the Company shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to Executive in connection with Section 5 of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with Executive's employment with the Company and its affiliates. Nothing in this Section 8 shall be construed to release the Company from its obligation to indemnify Executive as provided in Section 4(e) hereof.
.

Noncompetition, Confidentiality and Other Covenants
By and in consideration of the compensation and benefits to be provided by the Company hereunder, including the severance arrangements set forth herein, Executive agrees to the following:
During the Employment Period and until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the one year period following any Voluntary Termination of the Employment Period by Executive pursuant to Section 5 hereof, or (ii) the date a Change of Control occurs (the "Restriction Period"), Executive shall not become associated with any entity, whether as a principal, partner, employee, agent, consultant, shareholder (other than as a holder, or a member of a group which is a holder, of not in excess of 1% of the outstanding voting shares of any publicly traded company) or in any other relationship or capacity, paid or unpaid, that is actively engaged in any geographic area in any business which is in competition with the business of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the terms of this Section 9(a) shall not apply in the event of any termination of employment following a Change of Control as provided for in Section 6 of this Agreement.
(a)
Noncompetition
.
Without the prior written consent of the Company, except to the extent required by an order of a court having competent jurisdiction or under subpoena from an appropriate government agency, Executive shall not disclose to any third person, or permit the use of for the benefit of any person or any entity other than The Company or its affiliates, any trade secrets, customer lists, information regarding product development, marketing plans, sales plans, management organization information (including data and other information relating to members of the Board and management), operating policies or manuals, business plans, financial records, or other financial, organizational, commercial, business, sales, marketing, technical, product or employee information relating to the Company or its affiliates or information designated as confidential, proprietary, and/or a trade secret, or any other information relating to the Company or its affiliates that Executive knows from the circumstances, in good faith and good conscience, should be treated as confidential, or any information that the Company or its affiliates may receive belonging to customers, agents or others who do business with the Company or its affiliates, except to the extent that any such information previously has been disclosed to the public by the Company or is in the public domain (other than by reason of Executive's violation of this Section 9(b)).

During the Employment Period and until the earlier of : (i) the last day of the one year period following any Voluntary Termination of the Employment Period by Executive pursuant to Section 5 hereof, or (ii) the date of a Change of Control occurs, Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or induce any employee of the Company or its affiliates to terminate employment with such entity, and shall not directly or indirectly, either individually or as owner, agent, employee, consultant or otherwise, employ or offer employment to any person who is or was employed by the Company or an affiliate thereof unless such person shall have ceased to be employed by such entity for a period of at least six months.

.
Except as expressly provided herein, promptly following any termination of the Employment Period, Executive shall return to the Company all property of the Company, and all copies thereof in Executive's possession or under his control.
(d)
Company Property
.
Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations of Executive with respect to noncompetition, confidentiality, nonsolicitation, and Company property relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms of such covenants and obligations will cause the Company irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore, Executive agrees that the Company (i) shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) restraining Executive from committing any violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9, and (ii) shall have no further obligation to make any payments to Executive hereunder following any material violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9. These remedies are cumulative and are in addition to any other rights and remedies the Company may have at law or in equity. In connection with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, Executive represents that his economic means and circumstances are such that such provisions will not prevent him from providing for himself and his family on a basis satisfactory to him. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement following a Change of Control.

(e)
Certain Further Payments by Company
.
In the event that any amount or benefit paid or distributed to Executive pursuant to this Agreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or distributed to Executive by the Company or any affiliate (collectively, by the "Covered Payments"), are or become subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed, the Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified in this Section an additional amount (the "Tax Reimbursement Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive with respect to such Covered Payments, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Covered Payments and any Federal, state and local income tax and other tax on the Tax Reimbursement Payment provided for by this Section, but before deduction for any Federal, state or local income or employment tax withholding on such Covered Payments, shall be equal to the amount of the Covered Payments.
(i)
Tax Reimbursement Payment
.
For purposes of determining whether any of the Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax,
(ii)
Applicable Rules
.
such Covered Payments will be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to the Effective Date or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants"), the Company has a reasonable basis to conclude that such Covered Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments" or represent reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base amount," or such "parachute payments" are otherwise not subject to such Excise Tax, and
(A)
the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
(B)
For purposes of determining the amount of the Tax Reimbursement Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay: (A) Federal income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of Federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, and (B) any applicable state and local income and other taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in Federal incomes taxes which could be obtained from the deduction of such state or local taxes if paid in such year.
(iii)
Additional Rules
.
(iv)
Repayment or Additional Payment in Certain Circumstances
.
In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Tax Reimbursement Payment made, Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of such prior Tax Reimbursement Payment that would not have been paid if such lesser Excise Tax had been applied in initially calculating such Tax Reimbursement Payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Tax Reimbursement Payment to be repaid to the Company has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax authority, repayment thereof shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to Executive by the applicable tax authority. Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expenses thereof) if Executive's good faith claim for refund or credit is denied.
(A)
Repayment
.
In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Tax Reimbursement Payment is made (including, but not limited to, by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Tax Reimbursement Payment), the Company shall make an additional Tax Reimbursement Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalty payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
(B)
Additional Tax Reimbursement Payment
.
The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) provided for in this Section 6 shall be paid to Executive not later than 10 business days following the payment of the Covered Payments; provided, however, that if the amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) cannot be finally            determined on or before the date on which payment is due, the Company shall pay to            Executive by such date an amount estimated in good faith by the Accountants to be the minimum amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment and shall pay the remainder of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later than 45 calendar days after payment of the related Covered Payment. To the extent that the amount of the estimated Tax Reimbursement Payment exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, Executive shall repay such excess to the Company on the fifth business day after written demand by the Company for payment.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the terms of this Section 9(a) shall not apply in the event of any termination of employment following a Change of Control as provided for in Section 6 of this Agreement.
(a)
Noncompetition
.
Without the prior written consent of the Company, except to the extent required by an order of a court having competent jurisdiction or under subpoena from an appropriate government agency, Executive shall not disclose to any third person, or permit the use of for the benefit of any person or any entity other than The Company or its affiliates, any trade secrets, customer lists, information regarding product development, marketing plans, sales plans, management organization information (including data and other information relating to members of the Board and management), operating policies or manuals, business plans, financial records, or other financial, organizational, commercial, business, sales, marketing, technical, product or employee information relating to the Company or its affiliates or information designated as confidential, proprietary, and/or a trade secret, or any other information relating to the Company or its affiliates that Executive knows from the circumstances, in good faith and good conscience, should be treated as confidential, or any information that the Company or its affiliates may receive belonging to customers, agents or others who do business with the Company or its affiliates, except to the extent that any such information previously has been disclosed to the public by the Company or is in the public domain (other than by reason of Executive's violation of this Section 9(b)).

Company Property

Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations of Executive with respect to noncompetition, confidentiality, nonsolicitation, and Company property relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms of such covenants and obligations will cause the Company irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore, Executive agrees that the Company (i) shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) restraining Executive from committing any violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9, and (ii) shall have no further obligation to make any payments to Executive hereunder following any material violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9. These remedies are cumulative and are in addition to any other rights and remedies the Company may have at law or in equity. In connection with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, Executive represents that his economic means and circumstances are such that such provisions will not prevent him from providing for himself and his family on a basis satisfactory to him. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement following a Change of Control.

Additional Tax Reimbursement Payment

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the terms of this Section 9(a) shall not apply in the event of any termination of employment following a Change of Control as provided for in Section 6 of this Agreement.

Such amount shall be paid to Executive in equal monthly installments during the Restriction Period.

Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations of Executive with respect to noncompetition, confidentiality, nonsolicitation, and Company property relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms of such covenants and obligations will cause the Company irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore, Executive agrees that the Company (i) shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) restraining Executive from committing any violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9, and (ii) shall have no further obligation to make any payments to Executive hereunder following any material violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9. These remedies are cumulative and are in addition to any other rights and remedies the Company may have at law or in equity. In connection with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, Executive represents that his economic means and circumstances are such that such provisions will not prevent him from providing for himself and his family on a basis satisfactory to him. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement following a Change of Control.

Company hereby agrees to employ Executive and Executive hereby agrees to commence his employment by the Company.
Except as otherwise provided below, the Company shall employ Executive for the period commencing on the Commencement Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Commencement Date. At the expiration of the original term or any extended term (each a "Renewal Date"), Executive's employment hereunder shall be extended automatically, upon the same terms and conditions, for successive one-year periods, unless either party shall give written notice to the other of its intention not to renew such employment at least fifteen months prior to such Renewal Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the term of this Agreement shall be extended automatically without any action by either party until the second anniversary of such Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if not previously terminated pursuant to Sections 1(b), 5(a) or 6(a), the term of this Agreement shall terminate on the last day of the month in which Executive attains age 65, and such a termination upon Executive reaching age 65 shall be deemed to be a Termination Due to Retirement for purposes of this Agreement. The period during which Executive is employed pursuant to this Agreement, including any extension thereof in accordance with this Section 1(b), shall be referred to as the "Employment Period."

The Board or the appropriate committee of the Board may in its discretion periodically review Executive's base salary in light of competitive practices, the base salaries paid to other executive officers of the Company and the performance of Executive and the Company and its applicable affiliates, and may, in its discretion, increase such base salary by an amount it determines to be appropriate. Any such increase shall not reduce or limit any other obligation of the Company hereunder.

Executive's annual bonus opportunity shall not be reduced following any Change of Control, but may be reduced prior to a Change of Control solely pursuant to a cost-saving plan or structural realignment of total compensation elements that includes all senior executives and only to the extent that such reduction is proportionate to the reductions applicable to other senior executives. Executive's annual bonus opportunity, as it may be increased or reduced from time to time as provided herein, shall be referred to herein as "Target Bonus." The actual bonus, if any, payable for any such year shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the Company's Annual Executive Bonus Program or any successor annual incentive plan (the "Annual Plan") based upon the performance of the Company and/or its applicable affiliates and/or Executive against target objectives established under such Annual Plan. Subject to Executive's election to defer all or a portion of any annual bonus payable hereunder pursuant to the terms of any deferred compensation or savings plan or arrangement maintained or established by the Company or its affiliates, any annual bonus payable under this Section 3(b) shall be paid to Executive in accordance with the terms of the Annual Plan.

any merger, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization of the Company approved by the stockholders of the Company shall be consummated, other than any such transaction immediately following which the persons who were the Beneficial Owners of the outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such transaction are the Beneficial Owners of at least 55% of the total voting power represented by the securities of the entity surviving such transaction entitled to vote in the election of directors of such entity (or the ultimate parent of such entity) in substantially the same relative proportions as their ownership of the securities of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such transaction; provided that, such continuity of ownership (and preservation of relative voting power) shall be deemed to be satisfied if the failure to meet such threshold (or to preserve such relative voting power) is due solely to the acquisition of voting securities by an employee benefit plan of the Company, such surviving entity or any subsidiary of such surviving entity:
(iii)
any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all the assets of the Company approved by the stockholders of the Company shall be consummated; or
(iv)
within any 24 month period, the persons who were directors of the Company immediately before the beginning of such period (the "Incumbent Directors") shall cease (for any reason other than death) to constitute at least a majority of the Board or the board of directors of any successor to the Company, provided that any director who was not a director at the beginning of such period shall be deemed to be an Incumbent Director if such director (A) was elected to the Board by, or on the recommendation of or with the approval of, at least two-thirds of the directors who then qualified as Incumbent Directors either actually or by prior operation of this clause (v), and (B) was not designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in clause (iii) or (iv) of this definition of the term Change of Control in Section 6(d) of this Agreement.
(v)
means (i) in the case of a termination of the Employment Period for which a Notice of Termination is required, the date of receipt of such Notice of Termination or, if later, the date specified therein, as the case may be, or (ii) in all other cases, the actual date on which Executive's employment terminates during the Employment Period.
"Date of Termination"
means that a particular benefit shall not be paid or otherwise provided to Executive.

"Notice of Termination"
means that a particular benefit shall be paid to Executive in the amount, at the time, and in the form specified herein.
"Payable"
has the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 3(a)(9) of the Act, as supplemented by Section 13(d)(3) of the Act; provided, however, that Person shall not include (i) the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other Person controlled by the Company, (ii) any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company, or (iii) a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of securities of the Company.

Executive shall be permitted to respond and defend himself before the Board within 30 days after delivery to Executive of written notification of any proposed Termination for Cause which specifies in detail the reasons for such termination. If the majority of the members of the Board (excluding Executive) do not confirm that the Company had grounds for a Termination For Cause within 30 days after Executive has had his hearing before the Board, Executive shall have the option of treating his employment as not having terminated or as having been terminated pursuant to a Termination Without Cause.

(iv)
any attempt by the Company to terminate the Executive's employment in a Termination For Cause that is determined by the Board pursuant to Section 5(c) hereof, or in a proceeding pursuant to Section 9 or Section 10 hereof, not to constitute a Termination For Cause.
(v)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination of Executive's employment shall not be treated as a Termination For Good Reason (I) if Executive shall have consented in writing to the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim of Termination For Good Reason, or (II) if Executive shall have delivered a Notice of Termination to the Company, and the facts and circumstances specified therein as providing a basis for such Termination For Good Reason are cured by the Company within 10 days of its receipt of such Notice of Termination.
means (i) a cash amount equal to the present value, calculated using a discount rate equal to the then prevailing applicable Federal rate as determined under Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), of the additional retirement benefits that would have been payable or available to Executive under any ERPs, based on (A) the age and service Executive would have attained or completed had Executive continued in the Company's employ until the third anniversary of the occurrence of the Change of Control, and (B) where compensation is a relevant factor, his pensionable compensation as of the Date of Termination, such compensation to include, on the same terms as apply to other executives, any Severance Payment made to Executive, (ii) solely for purposes of vesting in any benefits under any ESPs, Executive shall be treated as having continued in the Company's employ until the third anniversary of the occurrence of such Change of Control, and (iii) solely for purposes of determining eligibility for retiree medical benefits under any retirement plan or any retiree welfare benefit plan, policy or program of the Company or its affiliates, and any ERPs related thereto, Executive shall be treated as having continued in the Company's employ until the third anniversary of the occurrence of such Change of Control and to have retired on the last day of such period. A Vested Benefits Enhancement shall only be applicable in the event that Executive's employment by the Company terminates prior to July 1, 2009.
"Vested Benefits Enhancement"
means a termination of employment by Executive other than a Termination For Good Reason, a Termination Due to Disability by Executive, or a Termination Due to Death.
"Voluntary Termination"
shall have the same meaning as that described in Section 5 hereof, except that the entitlement of Executive and/or his dependents to participation in the Welfare Benefit Plans shall continue until the third anniversary of the Date of Termination.
"Welfare Benefits Continuation"
If the Employment Period terminates because of a Termination Without Cause or a Termination For Good Reason, Executive shall be entitled to out-placement services, provided by the Company or its designee at the Company's expense, for 12 months following the Date of Termination, or such lesser period as the Executive may require such services.

(f) 
Certain Further Payments by Company
.
In the event that any amount or benefit paid or distributed to Executive pursuant to this Agreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or distributed to Executive by the Company or any affiliate (collectively, the "Covered Payments"), are or become subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed, the Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified in this Section an additional amount (the "Tax Reimbursement Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive with respect to such Covered Payments, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Covered Payments and any Federal, state and local income tax and other tax on the Tax Reimbursement Payment provided for by this Section, but before deduction for any Federal, state or local income or employment tax withholding on such Covered Payments, shall be equal to the amount of the Covered Payments.
(i)
Tax Reimbursement Payment
.
For purposes of determining whether any of the Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax,
(ii)
Applicable Rules
.
such Covered Payments will be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to the Effective Date or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants"), the Company has a reasonable basis to conclude that such Covered Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments" or represent reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base amount," or such "parachute payments" are otherwise not subject to such Excise Tax, and
(A)
the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
(B)
For purposes of determining the amount of the Tax Reimbursement Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay: (A) Federal income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of Federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, and (B) any applicable state and local income and other taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in Federal incomes taxes which could be obtained from the deduction of such state or local taxes if paid in such year.
(iii)
Additional Rules
.
(iv)
Repayment or Additional Payment in Certain Circumstances
.
In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Tax Reimbursement Payment made, Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of such prior Tax Reimbursement Payment that would not have been paid if such lesser Excise Tax had been applied in initially calculating such Tax Reimbursement Payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Tax Reimbursement Payment to be repaid to the Company has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax authority, repayment thereof shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to Executive by the applicable tax authority. Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expenses thereof) if Executive's good faith claim for refund or credit is denied.
(A)
Repayment
.
In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Tax Reimbursement Payment is made (including, but not limited to, by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Tax Reimbursement Payment), the Company shall make an additional Tax Reimbursement Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalty payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
(B)
Additional Tax Reimbursement Payment
.
The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) provided for in this Section 6 shall be paid to Executive not later than 10 business days following the payment of the Covered Payments; provided, however, that if the amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) cannot be finally determined on or before the date on which payment is due, the Company shall pay to Executive by such date an amount estimated in good faith by the Accountants to be the minimum amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment and shall pay the remainder of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later than 45 calendar days after payment of the related Covered Payment. To the extent that the amount of the estimated Tax Reimbursement Payment exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, Executive shall repay such excess to the Company on the fifth business day after written demand by the Company for payment.
(v)
Timing for Tax Reimbursement Payment
.
7. 
Timing of Payments

Pro-Rata Target Bonus shall be paid as follows: (a) if the Employment Period terminates in the first, second or third calendar quarter of any particular calendar year, then the Pro-Rata Target Bonus shall be paid no later than 10 days following the termination of the Employment Period; or (b) if the Employment Period terminates in the fourth calendar quarter of any particular calendar year, then the Pro-Rata Target Bonus shall be paid no later than the same time as similar awards are paid to other executives participating in the plans or programs under which the awards are paid, but in no event later than March 31 of the calendar year following the end of such fourth calendar quarter. Vested Benefits and Equity Awards shall be paid no later than the time for payment Determined Under the Applicable Plan except as otherwise expressly superseded or modified by this Agreement. Tax Reimbursement Payments shall be paid at the time specified in Section 6 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely for purposes of amounts payable pursuant to Section 5 hereof, if any amount payable to Executive pursuant to Section 5 would be nondeductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Code if paid in the year of Executive's termination, the Company shall have the option of paying such nondeductible amount, with interest at the one-year treasury bill rate as in effect on the date of such termination as reported in the Wall Street Journal, on the first day of the second calendar quarter in the year following such termination.
8. 
Full Discharge of Company Obligations
.
Except as expressly provided in the last sentence of this Section 8, the amounts payable to Executive pursuant to Section 5 following termination of his employment (including amounts payable with respect to Vested Benefits) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of Executive's rights under Section 5 of this Agreement and any other claims he may have in respect of his employment by the Company or any of its affiliates. Such amounts shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any and all such rights and claims and, upon Executive's receipt of such amounts, the Company shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to Executive in connection with Section 5 of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with Executive's employment with the Company and its affiliates. Nothing in this Section 8 shall be construed to release the Company from its obligation to indemnify Executive as provided in Section 4(e) hereof.
.
9. 
Noncompetition, Confidentiality and Other Covenants
By and in consideration of the compensation and benefits to be provided by the Company hereunder, including the severance arrangements set forth herein, Executive agrees to the following:
During the Employment Period and until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the one year period following any Voluntary Termination of the Employment Period by Executive pursuant to Section 5 hereof, or (ii) the date a Change of Control occurs (the "Restriction Period"), Executive shall not engage in competition with The Hartford. For purposes of this term, "Competition" is defined as: (1) your direct and/or indirect participation in the calling upon, soliciting business, or providing property and casualty or life insurance products to any person or entity who at the time of your termination from the Company is a current customer or client of The Hartford; and (2) your direct and/or indirect participation with regard to inducing or attempting to induce any agency, broker, broker-dealer, financial planner or supplier of The Hartford to terminate their Hartford agency contract with The Hartford. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the terms of this Section 9(a) shall not apply in the event of any termination of employment following a Change of Control as provided for in Section 6 of this Agreement.
(a)
Noncompetition
.
Without the prior written consent of the Company, except to the extent required by an order of a court having competent jurisdiction or under subpoena from an appropriate government agency, Executive shall not disclose to any third person, or permit the use of for the benefit of any person or any entity other than The Company or its affiliates, any trade secrets, customer lists, information regarding product development, marketing plans, sales plans, management organization information (including data and other information relating to members of the Board and management), operating policies or manuals, business plans, financial records, or other financial, organizational, commercial, business, sales, marketing, technical, product or employee information relating to the Company or its affiliates or information designated as confidential, proprietary, and/or a trade secret, or any other information relating to the Company or its affiliates that Executive knows from the circumstances, in good faith and good conscience, should be treated as confidential, or any information that the Company or its affiliates may receive belonging to customers, agents or others who do business with the Company or its affiliates, except to the extent that any such information previously has been disclosed to the public by the Company or is in the public domain (other than by reason of Executive's violation of this Section 9(b)).
(b)
Confidentiality
.
During the Employment Period and until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the one year period following any Voluntary Termination of the Employment Period by Executive pursuant to Section 5 hereof, or (ii) the date a Change of Control occurs, Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or induce any employee of the Company or its affiliates to terminate employment with such entity, and shall not directly or indirectly, either individually or as owner, agent, employee, consultant or otherwise, employ or offer employment to any person who is or was employed by the Company or an affiliate thereof unless such person shall have ceased to be employed by such entity for a period of at least six months. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the terms of this Section 9(c) shall not apply in the event of any termination of employment following a Change of Control as provided for in Section 6 of this Agreement.
(c)
Non-Solicitation of Employees
.
Except as expressly provided herein, promptly following any termination of the Employment Period, Executive shall return to the Company all property of the Company, and all copies thereof in Executive's possession or under his control.
(d)
Company Property
.
Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations of Executive with respect to noncompetition, confidentiality, nonsolicitation, and Company property relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms of such covenants and obligations will cause the Company irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore, Executive agrees that the Company (i) shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) restraining Executive from committing any violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9, and (ii) shall have no further obligation to pay unearned compensation, incentive awards, unvested awards, or bonus payments to Executive hereunder following any material violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9. These remedies are cumulative and are in addition to any other rights and remedies the Company may have at law or in equity. In connection with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, Executive represents that his economic means and circumstances are such that such provisions will not prevent him from providing for himself and his family on a basis satisfactory to him. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement following a Change of Control.

THIS AGREEMENT
     
     
the Company and/or one or more subsidiaries thereof (the "Subsidiaries") have employed Executive in an officer position and has determined that Executive holds an important position with the Company;
WHEREAS,
the Company believes that, in the event it is confronted with a situation that could result in a change in ownership or control of the Company, continuity of management will be essential to its ability to evaluate and respond to such situation in the best interests of shareholders;
WHEREAS,
the Company understands that any such situation will present significant concerns for Executive with respect to Executive's financial and job security;
WHEREAS,
the Company desires to assure itself of Executive's services during the period in which it is confronting such a situation, and to provide Executive with certain financial assurances to enable Executive to perform the responsibilities of Executive's position without undue distraction and to exercise judgment without bias due to Executive's personal circumstances; and
WHEREAS,
to achieve these objectives, the Company and Executive desire to enter into an agreement providing the Company and Executive with certain rights and obligations upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2 hereof).
WHEREAS,
in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein contained, it is hereby agreed by and between the Company and Executive as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE,
The effective date of this Agreement (the "Effective Date") shall be the date on which a Change of Control occurs; if Executive is not actively employed by the Company on the Effective Date, this Agreement shall be void and without effect.

(i)
any Person, other than the Company or a subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company shall purchase shares pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer to acquire any stock of the Company (or securities convertible into stock) for cash, securities or any other consideration, provided that after consummation of the offer, the Person in question is the Beneficial Owner of fifteen percent or more of the outstanding stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company (calculated as provided in paragraph (d) of Rule 13d-3 under the Act in the case of rights to acquire stock);

Repayment or Additional Payment in Certain Circumstances

Additional Tax Reimbursement Payment

TEXT OF THE HARTFORD SENIOR EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PAY PLAN
Page
OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
The purpose of The Hartford Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan (the "Plan") is to assist in occupational transition by providing severance pay for senior executives covered by this Plan whose employment is terminated under conditions set forth in this Plan.
This Plan was effective October 1, 1997, and most recently amended in September 2006. Any termination of employment of a Covered Employee that has an Effective Date (as defined herein) while this Plan is in effect shall be governed exclusively by the terms of this Plan and by no other plan, policy, practice or arrangement, except where this Plan is expressly superseded by a Key Executive Employment Protection Agreement with the Company, or an individual written employment contract or other written agreement with the Company. To the extent that this Plan is expressly superseded by any of the foregoing agreements or contracts, no severance shall be payable hereunder, and the provisions of this Plan will otherwise be deemed null and void and without effect.
You are a Covered Employee under this Plan if you are an "Employee" (as defined below) who (1) qualifies as an "Eligible Employee" (as defined below), (2) is paid on a salaried basis, and (3) is identified as a Tier Two executive. A person who is on an authorized leave of absence, paid or unpaid (including medical leave of absence), of not more than twenty-six (26) weeks who would otherwise qualify as a Covered Employees, but for being on leave of absence, will be considered a Covered Employees for purposes of this Plan.
For purposes of the Plan, "Employee" means any person regularly employed by Hartford Fire Insurance Company or any of its designated subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, the "Company"), but shall not include any person who performs services for the Company as an independent contractor or under any other non-employee classification, or who is classified by the Company as, or determined by the Company to be, an independent contractor.
For purposes of the Plan, "Eligible Employee" means an Employee employed by the Company; provided, however, that except as the Board of Directors or the Committee may otherwise provide on a basis uniformly applicable to all persons similarly situated, Eligible Employee shall not include any "Ineligible Person," which means all of the following: (1) a person who is paid on an hourly basis; or (2) a person who: (A) holds a position with the Company's "HARTEMP" Program, or (B) is hired to work for the Company through a temporary employment agency, or (C) is hired to a position with the Company with notice on his or her date of hire that the position will terminate on a certain date; or (3) a person who is a leased employee (within the meaning of Section 414(n)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) of the Company or is otherwise employed through a temporary help firm, technical help firm, staffing firm, employee leasing firm, or professional employer organization, regardless of whether such person is an Employee of the Company, or (4) a person who performs services for the Company as an independent contractor or under any other non-employee classification, or who is classified by the Company as, or determined by the Company to be, an independent contractor, regardless of whether such person is characterized or ultimately determined by the Internal Revenue Service or any other Federal, State or local governmental authority or regulatory body to be an employee of the Company or its affiliates for income or wage tax purposes or for any other purpose.
Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, if any person is an Ineligible Person or otherwise does not qualify as an Eligible Employee, or is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan, and such person is later required by a court or governmental authority or regulatory body to be classified as a person who is eligible to participate in the Plan, such person shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan, notwithstanding such classification, unless and until designated as an Eligible Employee by the Plan Administrator, and if so designated, the participation of such person in the Plan shall be prospective only.
If the Company terminates your employment and you sign a Release acceptable to the Company, you shall be provided severance pay in accordance with the terms of this Plan if you:
except
If you initiate termination of employment for any reason including resigning, retiring or failing to return to work immediately following the expiration of any leave of absence, no severance pay will be provided under this Plan.
No severance pay will be provided under this Plan upon any termination of employment as a result of your death, or as a result of your Disability as defined in The Hartford Investment and Savings Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the "Savings Plan").
5. 
Schedule of Severance Pay
Covered Employees will be provided severance pay in accordance with the following Schedule of Severance Pay which sets forth the months of Base Pay which are provided to a Covered Employee based upon the Covered Employee's Years of Service as of the Effective Date.
The severance payment provided will be subject to applicable federal, state and local taxes, which will be withheld from such payment where required by applicable law as determined in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator.
"Base Pay" shall mean your annual base salary at the Effective Date divided by twelve (12) months.
"Years of Service" shall mean the total number of completed years of employment measured from your Company service date to your Effective Date, rounded to the nearest whole year. Your Company service date is the date used to determine your eligibility for vesting under the applicable Company retirement plan in effect on the Effective Date.
Notwithstanding the above Schedule of Severance Pay, in no event (i) shall months of Base Pay provided to you exceed the number of months remaining between the Effective Date and your Normal Retirement Date, or (ii) shall severance pay exceed the equivalent of twice your total annual compensation during the year immediately preceding the Effective Date.
Except as provided in this Plan or under a Key Executive Employment Protection Agreement with the Company, or an individual written employment contract or other written agreement with the Company, you shall not be entitled to any notice of termination or pay in lieu thereof. At the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator or designee, notice may be provided.
Severance pay shall be paid in periodic payments according to the regular payroll schedule ("Periodic Payment"), provided that the Company reserves the right at any time to pay the remaining severance pay in a discounted lump sum, so long as such lump sum amount may be paid without causing the recipient to incur any additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code.
Any discounted lump sum paid under this Plan shall be equal to the present value of the remaining Periodic Payments of severance pay as determined by the Company using an interest rate equal to the prime rate at Citibank in effect on the date the Company notifies you that it is exercising its right to pay severance in the discounted lump sum.
Periodic Payment of severance pay will commence or the discounted lump sum will be paid on the next day following the Effective Date, except that where the Company exercises its right to pay the discounted lump sum after the commencement of Periodic Payments, it will be paid promptly after the Company exercises such right. Notwithstanding the above provisions and any other provision of the Plan, no severance payments will be made during the six month period following the Effective Date, unless earlier payment is permitted in accordance with guidance provided under Section 409A of the Code. Should severance payments be delayed in accordance with the preceding sentence, the accumulated Periodic Payments that would have been made but for the period of the delay shall be paid in a lump sum during the 10 day period following the six month anniversary of the Effective Date, together with interest thereon based on prevailing short term rates for the period between the date that the Periodic Payments would have been made but for the period of the delay and the date of payment of the lump sum.
In the event of your death during the period you are receiving Periodic Payment of severance pay, the amount of severance pay remaining shall be paid, subject to applicable law, in a discounted lump sum payment to your spouse, if any, or to such other beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by you in writing, or if you are not married and failing such designation, to your estate.
During the time period that you are receiving Periodic Payment of severance pay, or for which you receive severance pay by lump sum, you must continue to be available to render reasonable assistance to the Company, consistent with the level of your prior position with the Company, at times and locations that are mutually acceptable. In requesting such services, the Company will take into account any other commitments which you may have. After the Effective Date and normal wind up of your former duties, you will not be required to perform any regular services for the Company.
In the event you secure employment other than with the Company while receiving severance pay, you must notify the Company. Upon such notification the Company in its discretion may make a single discounted lump sum payment to you of all remaining severance pay, if such lump sum payment is not anticipated to result in your incurring additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code. Periodic Payment of severance pay will cease if you are rehired by the Company.
In the event you retire under the applicable Company retirement plan while receiving Periodic Payment, the Company will pay you any remaining severance pay in a single discounted lump sum payment, subject to any delay required in order to avoid the imposition of additional tax in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.
Except as otherwise provided herein, as long as you are receiving Periodic Payment, you will continue to be eligible for participation in Company employee benefit plans in effect as of the Effective Date, including without limitation, any non-qualified excess or supplemental benefit plans, in accordance with the applicable provisions of such plans. You will not be eligible to participate in any Company salary continuation, short-term or long-term disability plans, the Company business travel accident plan or any new employee benefit plan or any improvement to any existing employee benefit plan adopted by the Company after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the above, if your employment is terminated after June 30, 2009, you will not be able to accrue any additional service or benefits in any defined benefit pension plan of the Company, including any non-qualified excess or supplemental defined benefit pension plan, or receive credit for age, service or earnings thereunder, while receiving severance pay (this provision is adopted effective with the September 2006 restatement of the Plan, such that this provision shall be applicable with respect to individuals whose employment is terminated after June 30, 2009 with a right to receive severance benefits under the Plan).
If a lump sum payment of severance pay is made, eligibility to participate in all Company employee benefit plans ends.
Deductions for continuing group life and medical/dental/health insurance and participation in the Savings Plan remain available while receiving Periodic Payment of the severance pay, subject to the maximum time periods as specified by the terms of the respective plans in effect as of the Effective Date, and any restrictions on participation provided by applicable law.
9. 
Excluded Employee Compensation Plans, Programs, Arrangements and Perquisites
During the period you are receiving Periodic Payment of severance pay, you will not be eligible to accrue any paid time off or participate in any (i) bonus program; (ii) special termination programs; (iii) tax or financial advisory services; (iv) new awards under any long-term incentive compensation plan or program of the Company; (v) new or revised executive compensation programs that may be introduced after the Effective Date; or (vi) any other executive compensation program, plan, arrangement, practice, policy or perquisites unless specifically authorized by the Company in writing. The period during which you are receiving Periodic Payment of severance pay shall be counted as service for purposes of any Company long-term incentive compensation awards outstanding as of the Effective Date to the extent, if any, determined by the administrators of the applicable long-term incentive compensation plans. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, during such period you will continue to be eligible to vest in any outstanding unvested deferred restricted stock units (bonus swap), as well as any outstanding unvested stock option awards (a) any options awarded to you on December 17, 1997 or July 19, 2000, and (b) any other options that are designated under the terms of the award of such options as ineligible for continued crediting of service during Periodic Payment of severance pay. Also during such period, you will continue to be eligible to exercise any outstanding vested stock option awards, except to the extent that (I) such options first expire under the applicable plan or program, or (II) such options are designated under the terms of the award of such options as ineligible for continued exercise during Periodic Payment of severance pay.
except
If the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate or division of the Company or a portion thereof, at which you are employed, is sold or divested, and if (i) you accept employment or continued employment with the purchaser, or (ii) refuse employment or continued employment with the purchaser on terms and conditions substantially comparable to those in effect immediately preceding the sale or divestiture, you shall not be provided severance pay hereunder or any related benefits described in Section 8 or Section 9 of this Plan. The provisions of this Section 10 apply to all sales and divestitures (whether accomplished as sales of assets, sales of corporate entities or any other method), other than any sale or divestiture that qualifies as a Change of Control under The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan (as it may be amended from time to time).
If, during the period you are receiving Periodic Payment of severance pay, you (i) conduct yourself in a manner which is inimical to the best interests of the Company, or which adversely affects those interests; (ii) make statements, either oral or written, which are false or misleading or which disparage the Company; (iii) fail to comply with any Company Covenant Against Disclosure and Assignment of Rights to Intellectual Property or other similar policy or undertaking of the Company; (iv) without the Company's prior consent, induce any employees of the Company to leave their Company employment; or (v) fail to comply with applicable provisions of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct or other similar policy or undertaking of the Company, or any other applicable corporate policy of the Company, then the Company will have no further obligation to provide severance pay.
No severance pay will be provided under this Plan unless you execute and deliver to the Company a Release, satisfactory to the Company, in which you discharge and release the Company, its affiliates and the Company's directors, officers, employees and employee benefit plans from all claims (other than for benefits to which you are entitled under any Company employee benefit plan) arising out of your employment or termination of employment.
Any severance pay provided to you under this Plan shall be offset by reducing such amount by any severance pay, termination pay or similar pay or allowance which you receive or are entitled to receive (i) under any other Company plan, policy, practice, program or arrangement; (ii) pursuant to any Key Executive Employment Protection Agreement with the Company, or any individual written employment agreement or other written agreement with the Company; or (iii) by virtue of any law, custom or practice excluding, however, any unemployment compensation which you may receive as a state unemployment award.
Any severance pay provided to you under this Plan shall also be offset by reducing such severance pay by any severance pay, termination pay or similar pay or allowance you received as a result of any prior termination of employment with the Company.
Any severance pay and any notice pay provided to you under this Plan shall be offset by reducing such severance pay and notice pay by any payments made to you by the Company pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") and any similar federal, state or local law.
Any severance pay provided to you under this Plan shall be offset by reducing such severance pay by any payment made to you under any Company or statutory disability plan, policy, practice, program or arrangement where any such payment is made for any period of time after the Effective Date.
Responsibility for administration of this Plan rests with the Company's Executive Vice President, Human Resources (or other individual with similar responsibilities) or his designee ("Plan Administrator").
The Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive right to interpret this Plan, adopt any rules and regulations for carrying out this Plan as may be appropriate and decide any and all matters arising under this Plan, including, but not limited to, the right to determine appeals. Subject to applicable federal and state law, all interpretations and decisions by the Plan Administrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties affected thereby.
The Plan Administrator shall have the power to make amendments to the Plan that do not involve a material cost to the Company or are required by applicable law. Any other amendments to the Plan shall be made by the Board of Directors of Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The Company, through its Board of Directors, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate, suspend, amend or modify this Plan ("Plan Change") in whole or in part at any time without prior notice except that no such Plan Change, and no Plan amendment made by the Plan Administrator, may reduce or adversely affect severance pay for any employee whose employment terminates within two years of the effective date of such Plan Change or amendment, provided that such Executive was a Covered Employee under this Plan on the date of such Plan Change or amendment. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Plan Administrator or the Board of Directors may unilaterally amend this Plan at any time as may be necessary, in its reasonable judgment, to comply with law or to avoid payments to executives under the Plan being subject to an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. This Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and no action taken by the Company shall be construed in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax on executives under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Plan shall not be amended, modified, suspended or terminated during the period in which a Change of Control (as defined in The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan, as it may be amended from time to time) is threatened. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a Change of Control shall be deemed to be threatened for the period beginning on the date of any Potential Change of Control (as defined in The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan, as it may be amended from time to time), and ending upon the earlier of: (i) the second anniversary of the date of such Potential Change of Control, (ii) the date a Change of Control occurs, or (iii) the date the Board of Directors of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. or the appropriate committee thereof determines in good faith that a Change of Control is no longer threatened.
