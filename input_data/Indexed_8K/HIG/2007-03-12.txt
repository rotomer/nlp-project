     8. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all

     (b) No Underwriter shall have been advised by the Company, or shall have discovered and disclosed to the Company, that the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time or the Prospectus as of the date of the prospectus supplement comprising part of such Prospectus or as of the Time of Delivery contained, contains or will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, omits or will omit to state a material fact which is required to be stated therein or is necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in any case in the judgment of the Representatives after consultation with counsel to the Underwriters;
     (c) Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives such opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, with respect to the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Securities, the validity of the Designated Securities being delivered at such Time of Delivery, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and such other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
14
 
     (d) Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Company (with a statement authorizing you to rely thereon) their written opinion dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that:
     (i) The Designated Securities have been duly authorized, and when executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture; and the Designated Securities and the Indenture conform to the descriptions thereof in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
     (ii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and (b) general equity principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or law); and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; and

     (e) Neal S. Wolin, Esq., Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the Company, shall have furnished to you his written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that:
     (i) The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, with power and authority (corporate or other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
15
 
     (ii) The Company's authorized share capital is as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;

16
 
with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that he expresses no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States and in respect of matters of fact such counsel may rely upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries; that such counsel shall state he believes that both you and he are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates and copies of such opinions and certificates are made available to you;
provided
     (f) Neal S. Wolin, Esq., Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the Company, shall have furnished to you a letter, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, to the effect that:
     (i) Based upon specified participation of such counsel in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, (a) such counsel has no reason to believe that (i) as of the Effective Date, the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) as of the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) as of the date of the prospectus supplement comprising part of the Prospectus and as of the Time of Delivery, the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (b) the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date, the Prospectus, as of the date of the prospectus supplement comprising part of such Prospectus, and each of the documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, as of the date it was filed with the Commission (in each case, other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief), appeared on
17
 
their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and (c) such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; it being understood that such counsel may state that he has not independently verified factual statements in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any such amendment or supplement);
     (g) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for the Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, Deloitte and Touche LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of the Pricing Agreement and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, as to such matters ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;
     (h) (i) Except as described in or contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has not been any material adverse change in, or any adverse development which materially affects, the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, from the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and (ii) except as contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than (i) issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or (ii) shares of common stock repurchased by the Company pursuant to the Company's $2 billion share repurchase program) or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business affairs,
18
 
management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
     (i) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities the effect of which, in any case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in your reasonable judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
     (j) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange (the ""); (ii) a material suspension or limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) a material adverse change in the financial markets, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis; if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and
Exchange
     (k) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such
19
 
Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a), (h) and (i) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (including the Form T-1), the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter of Designated Securities will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary
20
 
prospectus supplement, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
21
 
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to
22
 
contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in the Pricing Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
Underwriter
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a)
23
 
above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to such Pricing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
     12. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated due to the failure of Davis Polk & Wardwell to deliver its opinion to the Representatives pursuant to Section 8(c) or pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities governed by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 7 and 9
24
 
hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than in respect of a breach of the Pricing Agreement by any Underwriter of Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
     13. In all dealings under the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Securities, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties thereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any such Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in such Pricing Agreement.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: General Counsel; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be

supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     14. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters and the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "" shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks in the City of New York are authorized or required to close.

     16. These Underwriting Agreement General Terms and Conditions and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
     17. The Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

(as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000.
     All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Indenture.
     The Company shall have the right, at its option, to redeem this Security, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
     1. 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed; or
     2. the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities of this series to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points.
In each case, the Company shall pay accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the
 
Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P.

     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
     Notice of redemption shall be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities of this series to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for such Securities shall state, among other things, the amount of Securities of this series to be redeemed, the Redemption Date, the manner in which the redemption price shall be calculated and the place or places that payment shall be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities to be
 
redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price together with accrued interest, interest will cease to accrue on any Securities of this series that have been called for redemption on the Redemption Date. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation.
     In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     Installments of accrued and unpaid interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of the Securities of this series, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms.
     The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction, discharge and defeasance of the entire indebtedness on this security, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place
 
where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Hartford Plaza Hartford, Connecticut 06115
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-108067), as amended (the "Registration Statement"), and the Prospectus Supplement, dated March 6, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), to the Prospectus dated December 3, 2003, of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.375% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (the "Notes") issued pursuant to the Senior Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of March 9, 2004 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank), as trustee (the "Trustee").
     In rendering the opinion expressed below, (a) we have examined and relied on the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such agreements, documents and records of the Company and its subsidiaries and such other instruments and certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and its subsidiaries and others as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of such opinion, (b) we have examined and relied as to factual matters upon, and have assumed the accuracy of, the statements made in the certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and its subsidiaries and others delivered to us and the representations and warranties contained in or made pursuant to the underwriting agreement and the pricing agreement pursuant to which the Notes were sold and (c) we have made such investigations of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for such opinion. In rendering the opinion expressed below, we have assumed without independent investigation or inquiry, (i) the authenticity and completeness of all documents submitted to us as originals, (ii) the genuineness of all signatures on all documents that we examined, (iii) the conformity to authentic originals and completeness of documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or reproduction copies, (iv) the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, (v) that the Trustee had and has the power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Indenture, (vi) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee, (vii) the enforceability of the Indenture against the Trustee and
 
(vii) the due authentication and delivery of the Notes on behalf of the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture.

     The opinion set forth above is subject to the following limitations and qualifications:
     (a) Our opinion is subject to the effects of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in law or equity), (iii) an implied covenant of good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing, and standards of materiality and (iv) limitations with respect to enforceability of provisions providing for indemnification or contribution arising under applicable law (including court decisions) or public policy.
     (b) We express no opinion as to the priority status under the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.  101  1330, as amended) of the Notes.
     (c) Without limiting the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision of the Indenture or the Notes that purports to (i) waive, release or vary any defense, right or privilege of, or any duties owing to, any party to the extent that such waiver, release or variation may be limited by applicable law, (ii) constitute a waiver of inconvenient forum or improper venue, or (iii) relate to the subject matter jurisdiction of a court to adjudicate any controversy. In addition, the enforceability of any provision in the Indenture or the Notes to the effect that () the terms thereof may not be waived or modified except in writing, () the express terms thereof supersede any inconsistent course of dealing, performance or usage or () certain determinations made by one party shall have conclusive effect, may be limited under certain circumstances.

     (d) We express no opinion as to whether a United States Federal court would accept jurisdiction in any dispute, action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to either the Indenture or the Notes or the transactions contemplated thereby.

     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Form 8-K filed on March 12, 2007, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and to the reference to our firm under the caption "Validity of the Notes" in the Prospectus Supplement.
