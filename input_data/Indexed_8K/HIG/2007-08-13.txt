Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
Members of senior management of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Company") intend to meet with various Company analysts and investors beginning in the evening of August 13, 2007. Over the course of those meetings, members of the Companys senior management intend to make the disclosures about the Companys share repurchase program set forth below. Through August 13, 2007, the Company has repurchased, or entered into trades to repurchase which have not yet settled, approximately $232 million of its securities (approximately 2.6 million shares) in the third quarter of 2007, at an average price of $89.49 per share (inclusive of applicable commissions), pursuant to the existing authorization of the Companys Board of Directors to repurchase up to $2 billion of the Companys securities. As previously disclosed, the Company repurchased $800 million of its securities (approximately 8.4 million shares) under this authorization in the first quarter of 2007. The Company may repurchase more shares over the balance of 2007. The timing of any future repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including the market price of the Companys securities, the Companys capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the Companys financial strength or credit ratings, and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.
