Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 4, 2008, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a collared accelerated stock repurchase confirmation agreement (the "Agreement") with Credit Suisse International ("Credit Suisse"), pursuant to which the Company has committed to repurchase $500 million of its common stock. The Company paid $500 million to Credit Suisse following execution of the Agreement. The number of shares actually purchased pursuant to the Agreement will be determined based on a discount to the volume weighted average share price of the Companys common stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the period of the stock repurchase program, subject to certain provisions that establish a minimum and maximum number of shares that may be repurchased by the Company. Credit Suisse will deliver the minimum number of shares to the Company shortly after determination of such minimum and maximum number of shares. The Company may receive additional shares from Credit Suisse depending on the average price of the Companys common stock over a period of time following delivery of the minimum number of shares, subject to a maximum number of shares. Shares repurchased under the Agreement will be held in treasury.
