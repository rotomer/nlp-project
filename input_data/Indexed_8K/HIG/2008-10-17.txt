     This Form 8-K/A amends the Form 8-K of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Company") dated October 17, 2008 to file the agreements and other instruments relating to the Company's sale of certain securities to Allianz SE.
     On October 17, 2008, the Company entered into an Investment Agreement (the "Investment Agreement") with Allianz SE ("Allianz"), as contemplated by the previously announced Transaction Agreement entered into by the parties on October 6, 2008 (the "Transaction Agreement"). On execution, the Investment Agreement superseded the Transaction Agreement. The description below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Investment Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K/A and incorporated by reference herein.
     Under the Investment Agreement, among other things, the Company agreed to issue and sell in a private placement to Allianz for aggregate cash consideration of $2.5 billion: (i) $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of the Company's 10% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068 (the "Debentures"); (ii) 6,048,387 shares of the Company's Series D Non-Voting Contingent Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series D Preferred Stock"), initially convertible (as discussed below) into 24,193,548 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") at an issue price of $31.00 per share of Common Stock; and (iii) warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase the Company's Series B Non-Voting Contingent Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock") and Series C Non-Voting Contingent Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series C Preferred Stock" and, together with the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock, the "Preferred Stock") structured to entitle Allianz, upon receipt of necessary approvals, to purchase 69,115,324 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $25.32 per share of Common Stock. The private placement closed on October 17, 2008 (the "Closing Date"). See Item 3.02 herein for additional information about the terms of the Preferred Stock and Warrants.
     Exercise of the Warrants and conversion of the Preferred Stock are subject to receipt of specified governmental and regulatory approvals. In addition, the conversion into 34,308,872 shares of Common Stock of the Series C Preferred Stock underlying certain of the Warrants is subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders in accordance with applicable regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. Under the Investment Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Allianz $75 million if such stockholder approval is not obtained at the first stockholder meeting to consider such approval, and $50 million if such stockholder approval is not obtained at a second such meeting. If such stockholder approval is not obtained at such second meeting, the Company would be obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to list the Series C Preferred Stock on a public securities exchange.
     The Company has also agreed that, for the one-year period following the Closing Date, it will pay certain amounts to Allianz if the Company effects or agrees to effect any transaction (or series of transactions) pursuant to which any person or group (within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws) is issued Common Stock or certain equity-related instruments constituting more than 5% of the Company's fully-diluted Common Stock outstanding at the time for an effective price per share (determined as provided in the Investment Agreement) of less than $25.32. Amounts so payable depend on the effective price for the applicable transaction (or the weighted average price for a series of transactions) and range from $50 million if the effective price per share is between $25.31 and $23.00, $150 million if between $22.99 and $20.00, $200 million if between $19.99 and $15.00 and $300 million if $14.99 or less.

Standstill Provisions
     Under the Investment Agreement, Allianz has agreed to certain standstill provisions that are also applicable to its subsidiaries and affiliates lasting until October 6, 2018, including limitations or prohibitions, among other things, on the acquisition of shares of Common Stock that would result in its beneficially owning more than 25% of the outstanding Common Stock, making or proposing a merger or change of control transaction or soliciting proxies, subject in each case to certain exceptions for a change of control and other matters, as specified in the Investment Agreement.
     The Company has also agreed under the Investment Agreement that, prior to entering into any binding agreement to effect a merger or similar business combination with a third party or to pay a break-up fee or similar compensation to a third party with respect to such a potential transaction, it will permit Allianz a reasonable period of time to conduct due diligence and make a bona fide competing proposal to the Company.
     As described under Item 1.01 above, pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Company issued to Allianz $1.75 billion of Debentures. The Debentures were issued pursuant to a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of June 6, 2008, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, dated as of October 17, 2008. The Debentures rank pari passu with the Company's 8.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068. The Debentures initially bear interest at an annual rate of 10%, payable semi-annually, until October 15, 2018. Thereafter, the Debentures bear interest at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 6.824%, payable quarterly. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Second Supplemental Indenture, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Form 8-K/A and incorporated by reference herein.
     As described under Item 1.01 above, pursuant to the Investment Agreement, on October 17, 2008, the Company issued to Allianz in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Series D Preferred Stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $750 million together with the Warrants. Until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Allianz has agreed not to transfer the Warrants, the related Preferred Stock and any Common Stock received upon exercise of the Warrants or the Preferred Stock, or to engage in transactions with equivalent economic effect, except for transfers to specified affiliates of Allianz.
Preferred Stock
     Each Series of Preferred Stock ranks pari passu with each other Series of Preferred Stock and participates on a pari passu basis with dividends and other distributions paid on the Common Stock. The Preferred Stock has no voting rights. Each share of Preferred Stock is initially convertible into four shares of Common Stock, subject to receipt of specified governmental, regulatory and other approvals (including receipt of stockholder approval as described above in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock), which vary by Series. The conversion ratio under the Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
Warrants
     Subject to receipt of specified governmental, regulatory and other approvals, the Warrants are exercisable to purchase 69,115,324 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $25.32 per share. Pending receipt of such approvals, the Warrants are immediately exercisable for the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, which are initially convertible, in the aggregate, into such number of shares of Common Stock. The exercise price under the Warrants is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Warrants have a term of seven years. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the forms of the Warrants, which are filed as Exhibits 4.2 and 4.3 to this Form 8-K/A and incorporated by reference herein.
Table of Contents
Registration Rights Agreement
     Under a Registration Rights Agreement between the Company and Allianz, Allianz is entitled to require the Company to register for resale Common Stock acquired by it upon exercise or conversion of the Warrants and the Preferred Stock under the U.S. federal securities laws. In certain circumstances, Allianz is also entitled to demand registration of the Warrants and the Series C Preferred Stock. Allianz's rights to require registration are subject to customary blackout and suspension periods. Allianz will also have customary piggyback registration rights. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Registration Rights Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 4.4 to this Form 8-K/A and incorporated by reference herein.
     In connection with the issuance of the Preferred Stock, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware Certificates of Designation establishing the terms of the Preferred Stock as described above, which amended the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, effective immediately upon filing on October 17, 2008. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificates of Designation, which are filed as Exhibits 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 to this Form 8-K/A and incorporated by reference herein.
     On October 17, 2008, the Company issued a press release announcing the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K/A.
     In connection with the issuance of the Debentures, the Company entered into a replacement capital covenant (the "RCC"), whereby the Company agreed for the benefit of certain of its debtholders named therein that it will not repay, redeem, defease or repurchase and will cause its subsidiaries not to purchase, as applicable, all or any portion of the Debentures at any time prior to October 15, 2048, except to the extent that the principal amount repaid or defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed the applicable percentage (as defined in the RCC) of the proceeds from the sale of certain replacement capital securities as set forth in the RCC. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the RCC, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Form 8-K/A and is incorporated by reference herein.

amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Common Stock as provided in subsection (f) below; , , that notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such delivery of certificates formerly representing the Series B Preferred Stock or of agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, the Company may determine that the shares of Common Stock issued upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be uncertificated, in which case the Company or its transfer agent will make the appropriate entries into the records of the Company and the Company shall not be obligated to issue a stock certificate for such shares of Common Stock.

          (c) No allowance or adjustment, except as expressly provided herein, shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of the Common Stock of record as of any date prior to the close of business on the date any share of Series B Preferred Stock is converted (the "") with respect to any share of Series B Preferred Stock. Prior to the close of business on the Conversion Date with respect to any share of Series B Preferred Stock, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and the holder of such share of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon conversion (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion) by virtue of holding such share of Series B Preferred Stock.
Conversion Date
          (d) Upon the conversion of any Series B Preferred Stock that is converted in part, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued to the holder a new certificate representing shares of Series B Preferred Stock equal in number to the unconverted portion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock represented by the certificate so surrendered.

In the event that a holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock and/or cash, securities or other property (including payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares) to be issued or paid upon conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock should be registered or paid or the manner in which such shares should be delivered, the Company shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the holder and in the manner shown on the records of the Company.
     (f) (i) No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Instead of any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon the conversion of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, the
 
Company shall pay to the holder of such share of Series B Preferred Stock an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the product of (A) such fraction and (B) the current market price (as defined below) of a share of Common Stock on the second trading day immediately preceding the day of conversion. If more than one share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock so surrendered.
          (ii) The "" per share of Common Stock at any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date in question. The closing price for each day shall be the closing price per share of Common Stock (or if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on that day as reported in composite transactions for the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed for trading. The closing price shall be determined without reference to after-hours or extended market trading. If the Common Stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange on the relevant date, the "closing price" of the Common Stock shall be the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market on the relevant date as reported by the Pink OTC Markets, Inc. or similar organization. If the Common Stock is not so quoted, the "closing price" of the Common Stock shall be determined by a U.S. nationally recognized independent investment banking firm selected by the Company for this purpose.
current market price
          (g) The Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on the conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5 and this Section; , , that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any registration or transfer involved in the issue or delivery of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of Series B Preferred Stock converted or to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.
provided
however
     7. .
Adjustments
          (a) If the Company shall (i) pay a dividend or make any other distribution with respect to its Common Stock which consists in whole or in part of shares of its Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify its Common Stock into a greater number of shares or (iii) combine or reclassify its Common Stock into a lesser number of shares, then in each of clause (i), (ii) and (iii), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted (regardless of whether or not actual conversion at such time would be permissible under Section 5 hereof) so that a holder of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock thereafter converted shall be entitled to receive the number and kind of other securities that such holder of Series B Preferred Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive after the happening of such dividend, subdivision, combination, or other reclassification had such shares of Series B Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to
 
the happening of such reclassification or any record date with respect thereto. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall become effective on the date of the dividend payment, subdivision, combination or issuance and shall be applied from the record date with respect thereto, if any, for such event. Such adjustment shall be made successively.
          (b) If the Company shall be a party to any transaction, including a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, reorganization, liquidation or recapitalization of the Common Stock (each of the foregoing being referred to as a ""), in each case as a result of which shares of Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive stock, securities or other property (including cash or any combination thereof), then, in connection with such Transaction, the Company shall make provision for the Series B Preferred Stock to be converted into the amount of shares of stock and other securities and the right to receive the property receivable (including cash) by a holder of that number of shares of Common Stock into which one share of Series B Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior to such Transaction (regardless of whether or not actual conversion into Common Stock at such time would be permissible under Section 5 hereof) and upon consummation of the Transaction the Series B Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into such amount of stock and other securities and the right to receive property at the same time and in the same manner as the Common Stock is so converted (or as promptly as practicable thereafter). Any shares of stock and other securities and property shall be payable to the holder upon surrender of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock or as otherwise provided for as if such delivery were of Common Stock and cash pursuant to Section 6(a). The Company shall not be a party to any Transaction unless the terms of such Transaction are consistent with the provisions of this Section.
Transaction
          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any case in which this Section provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event (A) issuing to the holder of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (B) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction as provided herein.
          (d) If the Company shall take any action affecting the shares of Common Stock, other than any action described in this Section, which in the reasonable opinion of the Board of Directors would adversely affect the conversion rights of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, then the number of shares of Common Stock that a share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into immediately before such action shall be adjusted, to the extent permitted by applicable law or regulation, in such manner and at such time as the Board of Directors may determine in good faith to be equitable in the circumstances. Any such determinations shall be memorialized in writing and shall be maintained on file at the Company's principal executive office and shall be made available to any stockholder upon request.
          (e) Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock into which one share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible is adjusted as herein provided, the chief financial officer of the Company or his or her designee(s) shall compute the required adjustment in accordance
 
with the foregoing provisions and shall prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. A copy of such certificate shall be filed promptly with the Conversion Agent and mailed to each holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock at such holder's last address as shown on the stock books of the Company.
          (f) The Company shall not, without the consent of a majority of the shares of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, make a publicly-announced tender offer for its Common Stock unless the Company provides to all holders of the Series B Preferred Stock the right to participate in the tender offer on the same terms and conditions as holders of Common Stock, provided that any Series B Preferred Shares tendered shall receive, upon surrender of the Series B Preferred Stock to the Company, the consideration payable with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock so tendered would be convertible at the time immediately prior to the consummation of the tender offer (regardless of whether or not actual conversion at such time would be permissible under Section 5 hereof).
     8. .
Reservation of Common Stock
          (a) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from all liens, charges and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or its issued shares of Common Stock held in its treasury, or both, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Series B Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock then deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

the happening of such reclassification or any record date with respect thereto.

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.06(a), during an APM Period, the Company may in its discretion select the types of APM Qualifying Securities to sell to satisfy its obligations under this Section 2.06(a):
Obligation to Issue APM Qualifying Securities
     (i) Prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period the Company shall not be obligated to issue Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants to the extent that the number of shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of such Qualifying Warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock previously issued or issuable upon the exercise of Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Company's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements immediately prior to the date of such issuance (the "").

issued (or which would be issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof) would exceed the Shares Available for Issuance (the ""). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek stockholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock if at any date the Shares Available for Issuance falls below the greater of:
Share Cap

     (B) the number of shares that the Company would be required to issue to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds (assuming a price per share equal to the average trading price of a share of Common Stock during the 10-Trading Day period preceding the date of determination) equal to the lesser of (a) the sum of (1) three times the amount of the then outstanding deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures plus (2) the amount of interest (including Additional Interest) that would accumulate on the Debentures during the next twelve months assuming no payments of interest thereon are made, and (b) the amount of interest (including Additional Interest) that would accumulate on the Debentures during the 10 year period beginning on the commencement of the then current Deferral Period. For purposes of determining the amounts accruing subsequent to October 15, 2018, interest will be computed by reference to Three-Month LIBOR for the then current Interest Period plus 6.824%.
     If the Company issues additional Debentures, the number of shares referred to in (A) above will be increased proportionately to the principal amount of such additional Debentures.
          (b) . Section 2.06(a) shall not apply, with respect to any Interest Payment Date, if not less than 10 Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date the Company shall have provided to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate (which the Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of Debentures) stating that a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing and identifying the type of Market Disruption Event that has occurred and the date(s) on which that Market Disruption Event occurred or existed. The obligation of the Company to sell APM Qualifying Securities to pay deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event exists or is continuing.
Market Disruption Event
     (c) .
Partial Payment of Deferred Interest
     (i) If the Eligible Proceeds received by the Company from one or more sales of APM Qualifying Securities are not sufficient to satisfy the full amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest, including Additional Interest, on the Debentures (together with the full amount of deferred interest on Parity Securities in the circumstances described in clause (ii) below) on any Interest Payment Date, such Eligible Proceeds shall be allocated to pay accrued and unpaid deferred interest to Holders of the Debentures (and Parity Securities, if applicable) on a pro rata basis based on the total amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest then due. Not less than 10 Business Days prior to any Interest Payment Date with respect to which insufficient Eligible Proceeds have been received by the Company, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such insufficient proceeds have been received and stating the amount of such proceeds allocable to pay accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the Debentures in accordance with this clause (i).

If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Debentures will also be a new Global Security.
Repayment of Debentures
provided

Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Holders
     (1) to modify the definition of "Shares Available for Issuance" contained in Section 1.01 and the related provisions of this Second Supplemental Indenture, that (a) the Company shall have determined in good faith that such modification is not materially adverse to the Holders of the Debentures, (b) the rating agencies then rating the Debentures shall have confirmed the then current ratings of the Debentures after taking into account such modification, and (c) the number of Shares Available for Issuance, after giving effect to such modification, will not fall below the threshold set forth in the second sentence of Section 2.06(a)(iii);
provided
     (2) to modify the definition of "APM Qualifying Securities" contained in Section 1.01 to eliminate (a) one, but not both, of Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants, and (b) any other security if, after the date hereof, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards used to prepare the Company's financial statements filed with the Commission, becomes effective, which, as a result, causes the Company to believe there is more than an insubstantial risk that failure to so modify the definition of "APM Qualifying Securities" would result in a reduction in the earnings per share of the Company, as calculated for financial reporting purposes; or
     (3) at the written request of Allianz SE or any of its Subsidiaries, to amend this Second Supplemental Indenture to divide the Debentures then beneficially owned by any such Person into two tranches (including, if appropriate, by designating such tranches as independent classes of this series capable of having as a result of a remarketing different voting rights and other terms), both of which shall have terms initially identical to the terms of the Debentures, but each of which shall be separately identifiable, whether by CUSIP or other comparable identification methodology, and at least one of which shall be in a minimum principal amount of not less than $250,000,000, it being understood that (a) the right of such Person to request action by the Company pursuant to this clause (3) shall be exercisable for so long as any such Person beneficially owns any of the Debentures; and (b) such Person shall have no right to instruct the Company to amend the terms of the tranches created pursuant to this clause (3).
     Section 8.01. . This Second Supplemental Indenture will become effective upon its execution and delivery.

The Company (or its agent or any intermediary) is permitted to withhold on any payments under this Second Supplemental Indenture any present or future taxes, duties, assessments, fees or other governmental charges as required by law.

Severability
     This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

file such reports, upon the request of any Warrantholder, to make publicly available such information as necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144 or Regulation S under the Securities Act), and it will use reasonable best efforts to take such further action as any Warrantholder may reasonably request, in each case to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to, if permitted by the terms of this Warrant and the Investment Agreement, sell this Warrant without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (A) Rule 144 or Regulation S under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or (B) any successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the written request of any Warrantholder, the Company will deliver to such Warrantholder a written statement that it has complied with such requirements.
          14. . The Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows; , that no single event shall be subject to adjustment under more than one subsection of this Section 14 (other than in the case of a dividend or distribution of different types of property, in which case Section 14(A), 14(B) or 14(C) shall apply to the appropriate parts of each such dividend or distribution); and , further that any issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant (in whole or in part) shall not itself give rise to any adjustment under this Section 14. For the purposes of convenience, adjustments are expressed in terms of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, without prejudice to Section 16.
Adjustments and Other Rights
provided
provided
          (A) . The Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted in the event the Company (i) pays a dividend or makes any other distribution with respect to its Common Stock solely in shares of its Common Stock, (ii) subdivides or reclassifies its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares or (iii) combines or reclassifies its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Warrantholder shall thereafter be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock that such Warrantholder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above, had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date with respect thereto. In such event, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the product of the Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock so issuable immediately thereafter. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such event. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Adjustments upon Certain Transactions
 
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
Ob = shares outstanding before the transaction in question
Oa = shares outstanding after the transaction in question
          (B) . If the Company shall fix a record date for the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution with respect to the Common Stock in cash (other than an Ordinary Cash Dividend or a dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(A) or Section 14(C)), the Exercise Price to be in effect after the record date for such dividend or distribution shall be determined by multiplying (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the last trading day preceding the first date (the "ex-date") on which the Common Stock first trades without the right to receive such dividend or distribution the Fair Market Value of the cash paid per share in such dividend or distribution, and the denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the last trading day before the ex-date. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(B), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. In the case of an adjustment for a cash dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly dividend, the "Fair Market Value" of such dividend as paid per share would be reduced by the per share amount of the cash dividend that would constitute an Ordinary Cash Dividend. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustments contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Cash Dividends and Distributions

Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
M = Fair Market Value immediately before ex-date
D = Fair Market Value of the dividend or distribution made per share of Common Stock
          (C) . If the Company shall fix a record date for the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution with respect to the Common Stock (other than an Ordinary Cash Dividend or a dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(A) or Section 14(B)), the Company shall distribute (for no additional consideration) such securities or property other than cash to the Warrantholder as such Warrantholder would have received had it held as of the applicable record date a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that were issuable under the Warrant as of such record date simultaneously with and on the same terms and conditions as such securities or other property are distributed to holders of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the payment of any dividend or distribution under this Section 14(C), the total number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant and the Exercise Price for the Warrant shall not be adjusted.
Non-Cash Dividends and Distributions
          (D) . If a publicly-announced tender offer made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the Common Stock shall be consummated, then the Exercise Price to be in effect after the tender offer is consummated shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding immediately before giving effect to the tender offer and (y) the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock as of the sixth trading day following the date on which such tender offer is consummated and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding after giving effect to the tender offer and (y) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the sixth trading day following the date on which such tender offer is consummated, and (ii) the aggregate Fair Market Value of all cash and any other consideration paid or payable for Common Share Equivalents (the "").

of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(D), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows, that the Exercise Price shall not be increased (and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant shall not be decreased) as a result of this paragraph 14(D).

Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the tender offer
Pa = exercise price per share after the tender offer

E = Tender Amount (the aggregate amount paid in the tender offer)
Ob = Shares equivalents outstanding before giving effect to tender offer
Oa = Shares equivalents outstanding after giving effect to tender offer
          (E) . Except to the extent an adjustment in respect of such transaction is made in accordance with Section 14(F) below, in case of (a) any transaction in which the Company issues any shares of Common Stock, rights or options to acquire Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock (other than Qualifying Employee Stock), or (b) the amendment to or change in the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of the securities described under (a) above, in each case for an Effective Price that is lower than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the business day immediately prior to the date of pricing of such transaction (each, a

Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(E), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Discounted Issuance
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment

securities or other property (""), then, as a condition of such Reorganization:
Exchange Property
     (a) to the extent the Exchange Property consists of cash, securities or other property (other than Voting Securities), the Warrantholder's right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise this Warrant to acquire the amount of Exchange Property (other than Voting Securities) which the Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (at the effective time of such Reorganization and after giving effect to any adjustments pursuant to this Section 14) would have been entitled to receive in such Reorganization; and
     (b) to the extent the Exchange Property consists of Voting Securities, the Warrantholder shall be issued a new Warrant on terms and conditions substantially identical to this Warrant to purchase a number of such Voting Securities for an Exercise Price per share calculated by (x) first, multiplying the initially adjusted number of Shares times the number of Voting Securities into which each share of Common Stock of the Company shall be converted in the Reorganization to arrive at the final adjusted number of Voting Securities of the other company issuable upon exercise of the Warrant and (y) second, dividing the initially adjusted Exercise Price per share by the number of Voting Securities into which each share of Common Stock of the Company shall be converted in the Reorganization to arrive at the final adjusted Exercise Price per Voting Security.
In the case of any Reorganization in which holders of Common Stock may make an election as between different types of Exchange Property, the Warrantholder shall be deemed to have elected to receive (unless Majority Holders otherwise notify the Company), first, Voting Securities, second, cash, and third other securities or property. The Company shall not affect any Reorganization unless the Company first shall have made appropriate provision to ensure that applicable provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions of this Article 14 and Article 15) and, if the Exchange Property includes any Registrable Securities, the Registration Rights Agreement shall immediately after giving effect to such Reorganization be assumed by and binding on the other party to the Reorganization (or the successor, parent company and/or issuer of such securities, as appropriate) and applicable to any Exchange Property deliverable upon the exercise of Warrants, pursuant to a customary assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Majority Holders. The Company shall notify the Warrantholder of any such proposed Reorganization Event reasonably prior to the consummation thereof so as to provide the Warrantholder with a reasonable opportunity to confirm compliance with the terms hereof and, if they elect, to exercise the Warrant in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof prior to consummation of the Reorganization; however, that in the case of a transaction which requires notice to be given to the holders of Common Stock of the Company, the Warrantholder shall be provided the same notice given to the holders of Common Stock of the Company.
provided,
 
          (G) . If the Company takes any action affecting the Common Stock, other than actions described in this Section 14, and in the opinion of the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, such action would materially adversely affect the exercise rights of the Warrantholder, then the Exercise Price for the Warrant and/or the number of Shares received upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted, to the extent permitted by law, in such a manner and at such time as the Board of Directors may determine in good faith to be equitable in the circumstances.
Certain Other Events
          (H) ; . All calculations under this Section 14 shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this Section 14 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a share of Common Stock, or more.
Rounding of Calculations
Minimum Adjustments

Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock or other stock or property issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant or the Exercise Price is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company shall give notice to the Warrantholder of such adjustment or adjustments and shall deliver to the Warrantholder a statement setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock or other stock or property issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant and the Exercise Price after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made.

Exercise Date
          Upon surrender of the Warrant and delivery of an Exercise Notice in conformity with the foregoing provisions, the Company shall transfer to the Warrantholder appropriate evidence of ownership of any Shares or other securities or property to which the Warrantholder is entitled, registered or otherwise placed in, or payable to the order of, such name or names as may be directed in writing by the Warrantholder, and shall deliver such evidence of ownership and any other securities or property to the Person entitled to receive the same, together with an amount in cash in lieu of any fraction of a share as provided in Section 6, within a reasonable time, not to exceed three business days after the Exercise Date. A Warrantholder shall be deemed to own and have all of the rights associated with any Shares or other securities or property to which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement upon the exercise of the Warrant in accordance with this Section 3.

          4. . Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, if the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock is greater than the Exercise Price (at the date of calculation as set forth below), in lieu of exercising (all or a portion of) the Warrant by paying the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 3, the Warrantholder may elect on the Exercise Date to receive shares of Common Stock equal to the value (as determined below) of the Warrant (or the portion thereof being exercised) by surrender of this Warrant and the Exercise Notice annexed hereto and stating in the Exercise Notice that the Warrantholder is electing "Net Settlement" with respect to all or any part of the Warrant surrendered, in which event the Company shall promptly issue to such Warrantholder a number of Shares computed using the following formula:
Net Settlement

X = the number of Shares issuable to the Warrantholder
Y = the number of Shares issuable under the Warrant or, if only a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the Warrant being exercised (as of the Exercise Date)
 
A = the Fair Market Value of one share of the Common Stock (as of the Exercise Date)
B = the Exercise Price (as of the Exercise Date)

The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of providing for the exercise of this Warrant, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Company will procure, at its sole expense, the listing of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, subject to issuance or notice of issuance, on all principal stock exchanges on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded and (B) maintain such listings of such Common Shares after issuance.

For the purposes of convenience, adjustments are expressed in terms of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, without prejudice to Section 16.
Adjustments and Other Rights
provided
provided
          (A) . The Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted in the event the Company (i) pays a dividend or makes any other distribution with respect to its Common Stock solely in shares of its Common Stock, (ii) subdivides or reclassifies its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares or (iii) combines or reclassifies its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Warrantholder shall thereafter be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock that such Warrantholder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above, had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date with respect thereto. In such event, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the product of the Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock so issuable immediately thereafter. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such event. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Adjustments upon Certain Transactions
 
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
Ob = shares outstanding before the transaction in question
Oa = shares outstanding after the transaction in question
          (B) . If the Company shall fix a record date for the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution with respect to the Common Stock in cash (other than an Ordinary Cash Dividend or a dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(A) or Section 14(C)), the Exercise Price to be in effect after the record date for such dividend or distribution shall be determined by multiplying (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the last trading day preceding the first date (the "ex-date") on which the Common Stock first trades without the right to receive such dividend or distribution the Fair Market Value of the cash paid per share in such dividend or distribution, and the denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the last trading day before the ex-date. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(B), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. In the case of an adjustment for a cash dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly dividend, the "Fair Market Value" of such dividend as paid per share would be reduced by the per share amount of the cash dividend that would constitute an Ordinary Cash Dividend. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustments contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Cash Dividends and Distributions

Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
M = Fair Market Value immediately before ex-date
D = Fair Market Value of the dividend or distribution made per share of Common Stock
          (C) . If the Company shall fix a record date for the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution with respect to the Common Stock (other than an Ordinary Cash Dividend or a dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(A) or Section 14(B)), the Company shall distribute (for no additional consideration) such securities or property other than cash to the Warrantholder as such Warrantholder would have received had it held as of the applicable record date a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that were issuable under the Warrant as of such record date simultaneously with and on the same terms and conditions as such securities or other property are distributed to holders of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the payment of any dividend or distribution under this Section 14(C), the total number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant and the Exercise Price for the Warrant shall not be adjusted.
Non-Cash Dividends and Distributions
          (D) . If a publicly-announced tender offer made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the Common Stock shall be consummated, then the Exercise Price to be in effect after the tender offer is consummated shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding immediately before giving effect to the tender offer and (y) the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock as of the sixth trading day following the date on which such tender offer is consummated and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding after giving effect to the tender offer and (y) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the sixth trading day following the date on which such tender offer is consummated, and (ii) the aggregate Fair Market Value of all cash and any other consideration paid or payable for Common Share Equivalents (the "").

For avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows, that the Exercise Price shall not be increased (and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant shall not be decreased) as a result of this paragraph 14(D).

Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(E), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:

Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment

Exchange Property
     (a) to the extent the Exchange Property consists of cash, securities or other property (other than Voting Securities), the Warrantholder's right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise this Warrant to acquire the amount of Exchange Property (other than Voting Securities) which the Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (at the effective time of such Reorganization and after giving effect to any adjustments pursuant to this Section 14) would have been entitled to receive in such Reorganization; and
     (b) to the extent the Exchange Property consists of Voting Securities, the Warrantholder shall be issued a new Warrant on terms and conditions substantially identical to this Warrant to purchase a number of such Voting Securities for an Exercise Price per share calculated by (x) first, multiplying the initially adjusted number of Shares times the number of Voting Securities into which each share of Common Stock of the Company shall be converted in the Reorganization to arrive at the final adjusted number of Voting Securities of the other company issuable upon exercise of the Warrant and (y) second, dividing the initially adjusted Exercise Price per share by the number of Voting Securities into which each share of Common Stock of the Company shall be converted in the Reorganization to arrive at the final adjusted Exercise Price per Voting Security.

     Section 3. .
Piggyback Registrations
     (a) .
Right to Piggyback
     Whenever prior to the Termination Date the Company proposes to register any Shares under the Securities Act (other than on a registration statement on Form S-8, F-8, S-4 or F-4), whether for its own account or for the account of one or more holders of Shares (other than the Investor), and the form of registration statement to be used may be used for any registration of Registrable Securities (a ""), the Company shall give written notice to the Investor of its intention to effect such a registration and, subject to Sections 3(b) and 3(c), shall include in such registration statement and in any offering of Shares to be made pursuant to that registration statement all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received a written request for inclusion therein from the Investor within 10 days after the Investor's receipt of the Company's notice or, in the case of a primary offering, such shorter time as is reasonably specified by the Company in light of the circumstances (that only Registrable Securities of the same class or classes as the Shares being registered may be included). The Company shall have no obligation to proceed with any Piggyback Registration and may abandon, terminate and/or withdraw such registration for any reason at any time prior to the pricing thereof. If the Company or
Piggyback Registration
provided
 
any other Person other than the Investor proposes to sell Shares in an underwritten offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, such offering shall be treated as a primary or secondary underwritten offering pursuant to a Piggyback Registration.
     (b) . If a Piggyback Registration is initiated as a primary underwritten offering on behalf of the Company and the managing underwriters advise the Company and the Investor (if the Investor has elected to include Registrable Securities in such Piggyback Registration) that in their opinion the number of Shares proposed to be included in such offering exceeds the number of Shares (of any class) which can be sold in such offering without materially delaying or jeopardizing the success of the offering (including the price per share of the Shares proposed to be sold in such offering), the Company shall include in such registration and offering (i) first, the number of Shares that the Company proposes to sell, and (ii) second, the number of Shares requested to be included therein by holders of Shares, including the Investor (if the Investor has elected to include Registrable Securities in such Piggyback Registration), pro rata among all such holders on the basis of the number of Shares requested to be included therein by all such holders or as such holders and the Company may otherwise agree (with allocations among different classes of Shares, if more than one are involved, to be determined by the Company).
Priority on Primary Piggyback Registrations
     (c) . If a Piggyback Registration is initiated as an underwritten registration on behalf of a holder of Shares other than the Investor, and the managing underwriters advise the Company that in their opinion the number of Shares proposed to be included in such registration exceeds the number of Shares (of any class) which can be sold in such offering without materially delaying or jeopardizing the success of the offering (including the price per share of the Shares to be sold in such offering), then the Company shall include in such registration (i) first, the number of Shares requested to be included therein by the holder(s) requesting such registration, (ii) second, the number of Shares requested to be included therein by other holders of Shares including the Investor (if the Investor has elected to include Registrable Securities in such Piggyback Registration) , pro rata among such holders on the basis of the number of Shares requested to be included therein by such holders or as such holders and the Company may otherwise agree (with allocations among different classes of Shares, if more than one are involved, to be determined by the Company and (iii) third, the number of Shares that the Company proposes to sell.
Priority on Secondary Piggyback Registrations
     (d) . If any Piggyback Registration is a primary or secondary underwritten offering, the Company shall have the right to select the managing underwriter or underwriters to administer any such offering.
Selection of Underwriters
     (e) . The Investor may not sell Registrable Securities in any offering pursuant to a Piggyback Registration unless it (a) agrees to sell such Shares on the same basis provided in the underwriting or other distribution arrangements approved by the Company and that apply to the Company and/or any other holders involved in such Piggyback Registration and (b) completes and executes
Basis of Participations
 
all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lockups and other documents required under the terms of such arrangements.
     Section 4. .
Suspension Periods
     (a) . The Company may (i) delay the filing or effectiveness of a Registration Statement in conjunction with a Registration or (ii) prior to the pricing of any underwritten offering or other offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration, delay such underwritten or other offering (and, if it so chooses, withdraw any registration statement that has been filed), but in each case described in clauses (i) and (ii) only if the Company determines in its sole discretion (x) that proceeding with such an offering would require the Company to disclose material information that would not otherwise be required to be disclosed at that time and that the disclosure of such information at that time would not be in the Company's best interests, or (y) that the registration or offering to be delayed would, if not delayed, materially adversely affect the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or materially interfere with, or jeopardize the success of, any pending or proposed material transaction, including any debt or equity financing, any acquisition or disposition, any recapitalization or reorganization or any other material transaction, whether due to commercial reasons, a desire to avoid premature disclosure of information or any other reason. Any period during which the Company has delayed a filing, an effective date or an offering pursuant to this Section 4 is herein called a "". If pursuant to this Section 4 the Company delays or withdraws a Registration requested by the Investor, the Investor shall be entitled to withdraw such request and, if it does so, such request shall not count against the restrictions on Registrations set forth in the last sentence of Section 2(a). The Company shall provide prompt written notice to the Investor of the commencement and termination of any Suspension Period (and any withdrawal of a registration statement pursuant to this Section 4) but shall not be obligated under this Agreement to disclose the reasons therefor. The Investor shall keep the existence of each Suspension Period confidential and refrain from making offers and sales of Registrable Securities (and direct any other Persons making such offers and sales to refrain from doing so) during each Suspension Period. In no event (i) may the Company deliver notice of a Suspension Period to the Investor more than two times in any calendar year and (ii) shall a Suspension Period or Suspension Periods be in effect for an aggregate of 180 days or more in any calendar year.

Holdback Agreements
     The restrictions in this Section 5 shall apply for as long as the Investor is the beneficial owner of any Registrable Securities. If the Company sells Shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for (or otherwise representing a right to acquire) Shares in a primary underwritten offering pursuant to any registration statement under the Securities Act (but only if the Investor is provided its piggyback rights, if any, in accordance with Sections 3(a) and 3(b)), or if any other Person sells Shares in a secondary underwritten offering pursuant to a Piggyback Registration in accordance with Sections 3(a) and 3(b), and if the managing underwriters for such offering advise the Company (in which case the Company promptly shall notify the Investor) that a public sale or distribution of Shares outside such offering would
 
materially adversely affect such offering, then, if requested by the Company, the Investor shall agree, as contemplated in this Section 5, not to (and to cause its majority owned Affiliates not to) sell, or request the registration of, any Registrable Securities (or any securities of any Person that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or otherwise represent a right to acquire, any Registrable Securities) for a period (each such period, a "") beginning on the 10 day before the pricing date for the underwritten offering and extending through the earlier of (i) the 90 day after such pricing date (subject to customary automatic extension in the event of the release of earnings results of or material news relating to the Company) and (ii) such earlier day (if any) as may be designated for this purpose by the managing underwriters for such offering (each such agreement of the Investor, a ""). Each Holdback Agreement shall be in writing in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the managing underwriters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Investor shall not be obligated to make a Holdback Agreement unless the Company and each selling shareholder in such offering also execute agreements substantially similar to such Holdback Agreement. A Holdback Agreement shall not apply to (i) the exercise of any warrants or options to purchase shares of the Company or the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock ( that such restrictions shall apply with respect to the securities issuable upon such exercise or conversion) or (ii) any Shares included in the underwritten offering giving rise to the application of this Section 5.

     (ii) use reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and to keep such Registration Statement effective for the relevant period required hereunder, but no longer than is necessary to complete the distribution of the Shares covered by such Registration Statement, and to comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all the Shares covered by such Registration Statement during such period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition set forth in such Registration Statement;
     (iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, or the lifting of any

     (v) use reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such U.S. jurisdictions as the Investor reasonably requests and continue such registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdictions for as long as the applicable Registration Statement may be required to be kept effective under this Agreement (that the Company will not be required to (I) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subparagraph (v), (II) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (III) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction);
provided
     (vi) notify the Investor and each distributor of such Registrable Securities identified by the Investor, at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto would be required under the Securities Act to be delivered by such distributor, of the occurrence of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and, at the request of the Investor, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare, as soon as practical, a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to any prospective purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such Prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (vii) in the case of an underwritten offering in which the Investor participates pursuant to a Registration or a Piggyback Registration, enter into an underwriting agreement in substantially the form used by the Company at that time for underwritten offerings of that kind, with appropriate modification, containing such provisions (including provisions for indemnification, lockups, opinions of counsel and comfort letters), and take all such other customary and reasonable actions as the managing underwriters of such offering may request in order to facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities (including, making members of senior management of the Company available at reasonable times and places to participate in "road-shows" that the managing underwriter determines are necessary to effect the offering);
     (viii) in the case of an underwritten offering in which the Investor participates pursuant to a Registration or a Piggyback Registration, and to the
 
extent not prohibited by applicable law, (A) make reasonably available, for inspection by the managing underwriters of such offering and one attorney and accountant acting for such managing underwriters, pertinent corporate documents and financial and other records of the Company and its subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates, (B) cause the Company's officers and employees to supply information reasonably requested by such managing underwriters or attorney in connection with such offering, (C) make the Company's independent accountants available for any such managing underwriters' due diligence and have them provide customary comfort letters to such underwriters in connection therewith; and (D) cause the Company's counsel to furnish customary legal opinions to such underwriters in connection therewith; , , that such records and other information shall be subject to such confidential treatment as is customary for underwriters' due diligence reviews;

     (x) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement and, a reasonable time before any proposed sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, provide the transfer agent with printed certificates for the Registrable Securities to be sold, subject to the provisions of Section 10;
     (xi) make generally available to its shareholders a consolidated earnings statement (which need not be audited) for a period of 12 months beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of such period, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of an earning statement under Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder; and
     (xii) promptly notify the Investor and the managing underwriters of any underwritten offering, if any:
     (1) when the Registration Statement, any pre-effective amendment, the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed and, with respect to the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective;
 
     (2) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for any additional information regarding the Investor;
     (3) of the notification to the Company by the SEC of its initiation of any proceeding with respect to the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement; and
     (4) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.
     For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of clauses (vii), (viii), (xi) and (xii) of this Section 6(a) shall apply only in respect of an underwritten offering and only if (based on market prices at the time the offering is requested by the Investor) the number of Registrable Securities to be sold in the offering would reasonably be expected to yield gross proceeds to the Investor of at least the Minimum Amount.
     (b) No Registration Statement (including any amendments thereto) shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and no Prospectus (including any supplements thereto) shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case, except for any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact made in reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor or any underwriter or other distributor specifically for use therein.
     (c) At all times after the Company has filed a registration statement with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act and until the Termination Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to continuously maintain in effect the registration statement of Common Stock under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and to use reasonable best efforts to file all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, all to the extent required to enable the Investor to be eligible to sell Registrable Securities (if any) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
     (d) The Company may require the Investor and each distributor of Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company information regarding such Person and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in connection with such registration.
     (e) The Investor agrees by having its Common Stock treated as Registrable Securities hereunder that, upon being advised in writing by the Company of the occurrence of an event pursuant to Section 6(a)(vi), the Investor will immediately
 
discontinue (and direct any other Persons making offers and sales of Registrable Securities to immediately discontinue) offers and sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement (other than those pursuant to a plan that is in effect prior to such time and that complies with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act) until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed and is furnished with a supplemented or amended Prospectus as contemplated by Section 6(a)(vi), and, if so directed by the Company, the Investor will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the Investor's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

Neither the Investor nor any other seller of Registrable Securities may use a free-writing prospectus to offer or sell any such shares without the Company's prior written consent.
     (g) It is understood and agreed that any failure of the Company to file a registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or to cause any such document to become or remain effective or usable within or for any particular period of time as provided in Section 2, or 6 or otherwise in this Agreement, due to reasons that are not reasonably within its control, or due to any refusal of the SEC to permit a registration statement or prospectus to become or remain effective or to be used because of unresolved SEC comments thereon (or on any documents incorporated therein by reference) despite the Company's good faith and reasonable best efforts to resolve those comments, shall not be a breach of this Agreement.
     (h) It is further understood and agreed that the Company shall not have any obligations under this Section 6 at any time on or after the Termination Date, unless an underwritten offering in which the Investor participates has been priced but not completed prior to the Termination Date, in which event the Company's obligations under this Section 6 shall continue with respect to such offering until it is so completed (but not more than 60 days after the commencement of the offering).
     (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to file a Registration Statement or include Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement unless it has received from the Investor, at least five days prior to the anticipated filing date of the Registration Statement, requested information required to be provided by the Investor for inclusion therein.

Indemnification
     (a) The Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Investor and each Person who controls the Investor (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs (including reasonable costs of investigation) and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Investor expressly for use therein. In connection with an underwritten offering in which the Investor participates conducted pursuant to a registration effected hereunder, the Company shall indemnify each participating underwriter and each Person who controls such underwriter (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Investor.
     (b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Investor is participating, the Investor shall furnish to the Company in writing such information as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, and shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its officers and directors and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs (including reasonable costs of investigation) and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that the same are made in reliance and in
 
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use therein.
     (c) Any party entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "") shall give written notice to the party indemnifying it (the "") of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification promptly after discovery by such Indemnified Party of any matters giving rise to a claim for indemnification. Such notice shall describe such claim in reasonable detail. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Party except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnified Party shall permit such Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. An Indemnifying Party who is entitled to, and elects to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to one local counsel) for Parties indemnified (hereunder or otherwise) by such Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim (and all other claims arising out of the same circumstances), unless in the reasonable judgment of any Indemnified Party there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified Party which are in addition to or may conflict with those available to another Indemnified Party with respect to such claim, in which case such maximum number of counsel for all Indemnified Parties shall be two rather than one). If any Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and elects to, assume the defense of a claim, the Indemnified Party shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof, with counsel of its own choice, but, except as set forth above, the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to reimburse the Indemnified Party for the costs thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any claim, all Indemnified Parties shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnifying Party related to the claim, and each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the Indemnified Party without its written consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into or agree to any settlement relating to a claim or action for which any Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification by any indemnified Party hereunder unless such judgment or settlement imposes no ongoing obligations on any such Indemnified Party and includes as an unconditional term the giving, by all relevant claimants and plaintiffs to such Indemnified Party, a release, satisfactory in form and substance to such Indemnified Party, from all liabilities in respect of such claim or action for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to such indemnification. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable hereunder for any amount paid or payable or incurred pursuant to or in connection with any judgment entered or settlement effected with the consent of an Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party has also consented to such judgment or settlement.

Indemnifying Party
 
     (d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified Person or any officer, director or controlling Person of such indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of securities and the Termination Date but only with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities made before the Termination Date or during the period following the Termination Date referred to in Section 6(h).
     (e) If the indemnification provided for in or pursuant to this Section 8 is due in accordance with the terms hereof, but is held by a court to be unavailable or unenforceable in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each applicable indemnifying Person, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified Person, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying Person on the one hand and of the indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which result in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying Person on the one hand and of the indemnified Person on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying Person or by the indemnified Person, and by such Person's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. In no event shall the liability of the indemnifying Person be greater in amount than the amount for which such indemnifying Person would have been obligated to pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof had been available under the circumstances.
     Section 9. .
Securities Act Restrictions
     The Registrable Securities are restricted securities under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Investor shall not, directly or through others, offer or sell any Registrable Securities except pursuant to a Registration Statement as contemplated herein or pursuant to Rule 144 or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act, if available. Prior to any transfer of Registrable Securities other than pursuant to an effective registration statement, the Investor shall notify the Company of such transfer and the Company may require the Investor to provide, prior to such transfer, such evidence that the transfer will comply with the Securities Act (including written representations or an opinion of counsel) as the Company may reasonably request. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to any Registrable Securities that are to be transferred in contravention of this Agreement. Any certificates representing the Registrable Securities may bear a legend (and the Company's share registry may bear a notation) referencing the restrictions on transfer contained in this Agreement (and the Investment Agreement), until such time as such securities have ceased to be (or are to be transferred in a manner that results in their ceasing to be) Registrable Securities. Subject to the provisions of this Section 9, the Company will replace any such legended certificates with unlegended certificates promptly upon surrender of the
 
legended certificates to the Company or its designee, in order to facilitate a lawful transfer or at any time after such shares cease to be Registrable Securities.
     Section 10. .
Transfers of Rights
     (a) If the Investor transfers any Registrable Securities to a Permitted Transferee in accordance with the Investment Agreement, such Permitted Transferee shall, together with all other such Permitted Transferees and the Investor, also have the rights of the Investor under this Agreement with respect to such Registrable Securities, but only if the Permitted Transferee signs and delivers to the Company a written acknowledgment (in form and substance satisfactory to the Company) that it has joined with the Investor and the other Permitted Transferees as a party to this Agreement and has assumed, severally but not jointly, the rights and obligations of the Investor hereunder with respect to the Registrable Securities transferred to it by the Investor. Each such transfer shall be effective when (but only when) the Permitted Transferee has signed and delivered the written acknowledgment to the Company. Upon any such effective transfer, the Permitted Transferee shall automatically have the rights so transferred, and the Investor's obligations under this Agreement, and the rights with respect to the Registrable Securities not so transferred, shall continue. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Person who acquires securities transferred in violation of this Agreement or the Investment Agreement, or who acquires securities that are not or upon acquisition cease to be Registrable Securities, shall have any rights under this Agreement with respect to such securities, and such securities shall not have the benefits afforded hereunder to Registrable Securities.
     Section 11. .

During the APM Period, the Company shall, subject to the limitations set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below, the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event as provided in Section 2.06(b), and Section 2.05(b) and Section 2.06(c), sell APM Qualifying Securities until the Company has raised an amount of Eligible Proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the Debentures, including Additional Interest, and apply such Eligible Proceeds as promptly as practicable following receipt thereof to the payment of all accrued and unpaid deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures until all such deferred interest (including Additional Interest) has been paid in full. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.06(a), during an APM Period, the Company may in its discretion select the types of APM Qualifying Securities to sell to satisfy its obligations under this Section 2.06(a):
Obligation to Issue APM Qualifying Securities
     (i) Prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period the Company shall not be obligated to issue Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants to the extent that the number of shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of such Qualifying Warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock previously issued or issuable upon the exercise of Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Company's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements immediately prior to the date of such issuance (the ""). If the Company shall have issued Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants during any Deferral Period such that the Common Stock Issuance Cap shall have been reached, notwithstanding any subsequent increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock in accordance with clause (iii) below or otherwise, the Common Stock Issuance Cap applicable during such Deferral Period shall not be increased. On and after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of any Deferral Period, the Common Stock Issuance Cap shall cease to apply and the Company shall pay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred, as provided in this Section 2.06(a) without regard to the Common Stock Issuance Cap, but subject to the other limitations set forth herein. Upon the termination of any Deferral Period, if the Company shall thereafter start a new Deferral Period, the Common Stock Issuance Cap shall apply without regard to the shares of Common Stock and Qualifying Warrants issued in any prior Deferral Period. Notwithstanding the Common Stock Issuance Cap, the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to issue Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants in excess of the Common Stock Issuance Cap for the purpose of paying deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures or for any other purpose;
Common Stock Issuance Cap
     (ii) The Company shall not issue Qualifying Preferred Stock or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock to the extent that the net proceeds of any issuance of Qualifying Preferred Stock or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock applied, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of Qualifying Preferred Stock and any still-outstanding Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock applied during the current and all prior Deferral Periods, to pay deferred interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.06, would exceed 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures (the "");
Preferred Stock Issuance Cap
     (iii) Notwithstanding the Common Stock Issuance Cap and the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, so long as any Debentures shall remain Outstanding, the Company shall not sell Common Stock, Qualifying Warrants, or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock for the purpose of paying deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures in an amount such that the Common Stock to be
 
issued (or which would be issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof) would exceed the Shares Available for Issuance (the ""). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek stockholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock if at any date the Shares Available for Issuance falls below the greater of:
Share Cap
     (A) 201 million shares (or 402 million shares if the Company has amended the Definition of APM Qualifying Securities to eliminate Common Stock) (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction); and
     (B) the number of shares that the Company would be required to issue to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds (assuming a price per share equal to the average trading price of a share of Common Stock during the 10-Trading Day period preceding the date of determination) equal to the lesser of (a) the sum of (1) three times the amount of the then outstanding deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures plus (2) the amount of interest (including Additional Interest) that would accumulate on the Debentures during the next twelve months assuming no payments of interest thereon are made, and (b) the amount of interest (including Additional Interest) that would accumulate on the Debentures during the 10 year period beginning on the commencement of the then current Deferral Period. For purposes of determining the amounts accruing subsequent to October 15, 2018, interest will be computed by reference to Three-Month LIBOR for the then current Interest Period plus 6.824%.
     If the Company issues additional Debentures, the number of shares referred to in (A) above will be increased proportionately to the principal amount of such additional Debentures.
          (b) . Section 2.06(a) shall not apply, with respect to any Interest Payment Date, if not less than 10 Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date the Company shall have provided to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate (which the Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of Debentures) stating that a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing and identifying the type of Market Disruption Event that has occurred and the date(s) on which that Market Disruption Event occurred or existed. The obligation of the Company to sell APM Qualifying Securities to pay deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event exists or is continuing.
Market Disruption Event
     (c) .
Partial Payment of Deferred Interest
     (i) If the Eligible Proceeds received by the Company from one or more sales of APM Qualifying Securities are not sufficient to satisfy the full amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest, including Additional Interest, on the Debentures (together with the full amount of deferred interest on Parity Securities in the circumstances described in clause (ii) below) on any Interest Payment Date, such Eligible Proceeds shall be allocated to pay accrued and unpaid deferred interest to Holders of the Debentures (and Parity Securities, if applicable) on a pro rata basis based on the total amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest then due. Not less than 10 Business Days prior to any Interest Payment Date with respect to which insufficient Eligible Proceeds have been received by the Company, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such insufficient proceeds have been received and stating the amount of such proceeds allocable to pay accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the Debentures in accordance with this clause (i).
     (ii) If on any date or for any period the Company pays interest on any class of Parity Securities in an amount that is less than the full amount of accrued but unpaid interest payable on such class of Parity Securities, including pursuant to an obligation to pay to the holders of such Parity Securities the proceeds of a sale of APM Qualifying Securities, the Company will make payments on all outstanding classes of Parity Securities on the same date or for the same corresponding period as on the Debentures on a pro rata basis based on the total amounts then due, except and to the extent the terms of any such Parity Securities (each a "") would prohibit the Company from making such payments on such Particular Parity Security.

Exercise Date
          Upon surrender of the Warrant and delivery of an Exercise Notice in conformity with the foregoing provisions, the Company shall transfer to the Warrantholder appropriate evidence of ownership of any Shares or other securities or property to which the Warrantholder is entitled, registered or otherwise placed in, or payable to the order of, such name or names as may be directed in writing by the Warrantholder, and shall deliver such evidence of ownership and any other securities or property to the Person entitled to receive the same, together with an amount in cash in lieu of any fraction of a share as provided in Section 6, within a reasonable time, not to exceed three business days after the Exercise Date. A Warrantholder shall be deemed to own and have all of the rights associated with any Shares or other securities or property to which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement upon the exercise of the Warrant in accordance with this Section 3.

          4. . Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, if the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock is greater than the Exercise Price (at the date of calculation as set forth below), in lieu of exercising (all or a portion of) the Warrant by paying the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 3, the Warrantholder may elect on the Exercise Date to receive shares of Common Stock equal to the value (as determined below) of the Warrant (or the portion thereof being exercised) by surrender of this Warrant and the Exercise Notice annexed hereto and stating in the Exercise Notice that the Warrantholder is electing "Net Settlement" with respect to all or any part of the Warrant surrendered, in which event the Company shall promptly issue to such Warrantholder a number of Shares computed using the following formula:
Net Settlement
Where:
X = the number of Shares issuable to the Warrantholder
Y = the number of Shares issuable under the Warrant or, if only a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the Warrant being exercised (as of the Exercise Date)
 
A = the Fair Market Value of one share of the Common Stock (as of the Exercise Date)
B = the Exercise Price (as of the Exercise Date)
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Warrantholder elects "Net Settlement", the provisions of Section 16 apply. All calculations under this Section 4 shall be made as if shares of Common Stock are issuable.
          5. . The Company hereby represents and warrants that any Shares issued upon the exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 will be duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of providing for the exercise of this Warrant, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Company will procure, at its sole expense, the listing of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, subject to issuance or notice of issuance, on all principal stock exchanges on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded and (B) maintain such listings of such Common Shares after issuance.

No Fractional Shares or Scrip
          7. . This Warrant does not entitle the Warrantholder to any voting rights or other rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to Exercise Date.

No Rights as Stockholders; Transfer Books

          14. . The Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows; , that no single event shall be subject to adjustment under more than one subsection of this Section 14 (other than in the case of a dividend or distribution of different types of property, in which case Section 14(A), 14(B) or 14(C) shall apply to the appropriate parts of each such dividend or distribution); and , further that any issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant (in whole or in part) shall not itself give rise to any adjustment under this Section 14. For the purposes of convenience, adjustments are expressed in terms of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, without prejudice to Section 16.
Adjustments and Other Rights
provided
provided
          (A) . The Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted in the event the Company (i) pays a dividend or makes any other distribution with respect to its Common Stock solely in shares of its Common Stock, (ii) subdivides or reclassifies its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares or (iii) combines or reclassifies its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Warrantholder shall thereafter be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock that such Warrantholder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above, had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date with respect thereto. In such event, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the product of the Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock so issuable immediately thereafter. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such event. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Adjustments upon Certain Transactions
 
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
Ob = shares outstanding before the transaction in question
Oa = shares outstanding after the transaction in question
          (B) . If the Company shall fix a record date for the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution with respect to the Common Stock in cash (other than an Ordinary Cash Dividend or a dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(A) or Section 14(C)), the Exercise Price to be in effect after the record date for such dividend or distribution shall be determined by multiplying (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the last trading day preceding the first date (the "ex-date") on which the Common Stock first trades without the right to receive such dividend or distribution the Fair Market Value of the cash paid per share in such dividend or distribution, and the denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the last trading day before the ex-date. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(B), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. In the case of an adjustment for a cash dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly dividend, the "Fair Market Value" of such dividend as paid per share would be reduced by the per share amount of the cash dividend that would constitute an Ordinary Cash Dividend. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustments contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Cash Dividends and Distributions
less
 
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
M = Fair Market Value immediately before ex-date
D = Fair Market Value of the dividend or distribution made per share of Common Stock
          (C) . If the Company shall fix a record date for the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution with respect to the Common Stock (other than an Ordinary Cash Dividend or a dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(A) or Section 14(B)), the Company shall distribute (for no additional consideration) such securities or property other than cash to the Warrantholder as such Warrantholder would have received had it held as of the applicable record date a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that were issuable under the Warrant as of such record date simultaneously with and on the same terms and conditions as such securities or other property are distributed to holders of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the payment of any dividend or distribution under this Section 14(C), the total number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant and the Exercise Price for the Warrant shall not be adjusted.
Non-Cash Dividends and Distributions
          (D) . If a publicly-announced tender offer made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the Common Stock shall be consummated, then the Exercise Price to be in effect after the tender offer is consummated shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding immediately before giving effect to the tender offer and (y) the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock as of the sixth trading day following the date on which such tender offer is consummated and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding after giving effect to the tender offer and (y) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the sixth trading day following the date on which such tender offer is consummated, and (ii) the aggregate Fair Market Value of all cash and any other consideration paid or payable for Common Share Equivalents (the "").

of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(D), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows, that the Exercise Price shall not be increased (and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant shall not be decreased) as a result of this paragraph 14(D).
provided
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the tender offer
Pa = exercise price per share after the tender offer

E = Tender Amount (the aggregate amount paid in the tender offer)
Ob = Shares equivalents outstanding before giving effect to tender offer
Oa = Shares equivalents outstanding after giving effect to tender offer
          (E) . Except to the extent an adjustment in respect of such transaction is made in accordance with Section 14(F) below, in case of (a) any transaction in which the Company issues any shares of Common Stock, rights or options to acquire Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock (other than Qualifying Employee Stock), or (b) the amendment to or change in the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of the securities described under (a) above, in each case for an Effective Price that is lower than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the business day immediately prior to the date of pricing of such transaction (each, a
Discounted Issuances
 
""), the Exercise Price effective immediately following such Discounted Issuance shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price then in effect by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding on the business day immediately prior to the date of pricing of the Discounted Issuance plus (y) the total number of Common Shares that the aggregate Effective Price would purchase at the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on such business day, and the denominator of which is the sum of (x) the number of Common Share Equivalents outstanding on the business day immediately prior to the date of pricing of the Discounted Issuance plus (y) the total number of additional Common Shares offered for subscription or purchase or into which such convertible securities could be converted pursuant to the Discounted Issuance. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(E), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Discounted Issuance
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
F = shares that Effective Price could purchase at fair market value
I = number of shares issued or deemed issued
Ob = share equivalents outstanding on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect to the issuance

securities or other property (""), then, as a condition of such Reorganization:
Exchange Property
     (a) to the extent the Exchange Property consists of cash, securities or other property (other than Voting Securities), the Warrantholder's right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise this Warrant to acquire the amount of Exchange Property (other than Voting Securities) which the Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (at the effective time of such Reorganization and after giving effect to any adjustments pursuant to this Section 14) would have been entitled to receive in such Reorganization; and
     (b) to the extent the Exchange Property consists of Voting Securities, the Warrantholder shall be issued a new Warrant on terms and conditions substantially identical to this Warrant to purchase a number of such Voting Securities for an Exercise Price per share calculated by (x) first, multiplying the initially adjusted number of Shares times the number of Voting Securities into which each share of Common Stock of the Company shall be converted in the Reorganization to arrive at the final adjusted number of Voting Securities of the other company issuable upon exercise of the Warrant and (y) second, dividing the initially adjusted Exercise Price per share by the number of Voting Securities into which each share of Common Stock of the Company shall be converted in the Reorganization to arrive at the final adjusted Exercise Price per Voting Security.
In the case of any Reorganization in which holders of Common Stock may make an election as between different types of Exchange Property, the Warrantholder shall be deemed to have elected to receive (unless Majority Holders otherwise notify the Company), first, Voting Securities, second, cash, and third other securities or property. The Company shall not affect any Reorganization unless the Company first shall have made appropriate provision to ensure that applicable provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions of this Article 14 and Article 15) and, if the Exchange Property includes any Registrable Securities, the Registration Rights Agreement shall immediately after giving effect to such Reorganization be assumed by and binding on the other party to the Reorganization (or the successor, parent company and/or issuer of such securities, as appropriate) and applicable to any Exchange Property deliverable upon the exercise of Warrants, pursuant to a customary assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Majority Holders. The Company shall notify the Warrantholder of any such proposed Reorganization Event reasonably prior to the consummation thereof so as to provide the Warrantholder with a reasonable opportunity to confirm compliance with the terms hereof and, if they elect, to exercise the Warrant in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof prior to consummation of the Reorganization; however, that in the case of a transaction which requires notice to be given to the holders of Common Stock of the Company, the Warrantholder shall be provided the same notice given to the holders of Common Stock of the Company.
provided,
 
          (G) . If the Company takes any action affecting the Common Stock, other than actions described in this Section 14, and in the opinion of the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, such action would materially adversely affect the exercise rights of the Warrantholder, then the Exercise Price for the Warrant and/or the number of Shares received upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted, to the extent permitted by law, in such a manner and at such time as the Board of Directors may determine in good faith to be equitable in the circumstances.
Certain Other Events
          (H) ; . All calculations under this Section 14 shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this Section 14 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a share of Common Stock, or more.
Rounding of Calculations

The Company hereby represents and warrants that any Shares issued upon the exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 will upon receipt of Stockholder Approval be duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company agrees that the Shares so issued will be deemed to have been issued to the Warrantholder as of the close of business on the Exercise Date, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company may then be closed or certificates representing such Shares may not be actually delivered on such date. The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of providing for the exercise of this Warrant, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Company will procure, at its sole expense, the listing of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, subject to issuance or notice of issuance, on all principal stock exchanges on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded and (B) maintain such listings of such Common Shares after issuance. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Common Shares may be issued without violation of any law or regulation applicable to the Company or of any requirement of any securities exchange applicable to the Company on which the Shares are listed or traded.
Authorization; Listing
          6. . No fractional Shares or scrip representing fractional Shares shall be issued upon any exercise of this Warrant. In lieu of any fractional Share to which the Warrantholder would otherwise be entitled, the Warrantholder shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the Exercise Date less the Exercise Price for such fractional share.
No Fractional Shares or Scrip
          7. . This Warrant does not entitle the Warrantholder to any voting rights or other rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to Exercise Date. The Company will at no time close its transfer books against transfer of this Warrant in any manner which interferes with the timely transfer and exercise of this Warrant.
No Rights as Stockholders; Transfer Books
          8. . Issuance of certificates for Shares (or other securities) to the Warrantholder upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Warrantholder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company.
Charges, Taxes and Expenses
 
          9. . (A) Subject to compliance with clauses (B) and (C) of this Section 9, this Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, upon the books of the Company by the registered holder hereof in person or by duly authorized attorney, and a new warrant shall be made and delivered by the Company, of the same tenor and date as this Warrant but registered in the name of one or more transferees, upon surrender of this Warrant, duly endorsed, to the office or agency of the Company described in Section 3. All expenses (other than stock transfer taxes) and other charges payable in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the new warrants pursuant to this Section 9 shall be paid by the Company.

          (B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Warrant and any rights hereunder, and any Shares issued upon exercise of this Warrant, shall be subject to the applicable restrictions as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Investment Agreement.
          (C) If and for so long as required by the Investment Agreement, this Warrant shall contain a legend as set forth in Section 4.4 of the Investment Agreement.
          10. . This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the Warrantholder to the Company, for a new warrant or warrants of like tenor and representing the right to purchase the same aggregate number of Shares. The Company shall maintain a registry showing the name and address of the Warrantholder as the registered holder of this Warrant and in which the Company shall record all exchanges, exercises and transfers of Warrants. This Warrant may be surrendered for exchange or exercise, in accordance with its terms, at the office of the Company, and the Company shall be entitled to rely in all respects, prior to written notice to the contrary, upon such registry.
Exchange and Registry of Warrant
          11. . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant, and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of a bond, indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company shall make and deliver, in lieu of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant, a new Warrant of like tenor and representing the right to purchase the same aggregate number of Shares as provided for in such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant.
Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant
          12. . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall not be a business day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding day that is a business day.
Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc
          13. . The Company covenants that it will use its reasonable best efforts to timely file all reports and other documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to
Rule 144 Information
 
file such reports, upon the request of any Warrantholder, to make publicly available such information as necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144 or Regulation S under the Securities Act), and it will use reasonable best efforts to take such further action as any Warrantholder may reasonably request, in each case to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to, if permitted by the terms of this Warrant and the Investment Agreement, sell this Warrant without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (A) Rule 144 or Regulation S under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or (B) any successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the written request of any Warrantholder, the Company will deliver to such Warrantholder a written statement that it has complied with such requirements.
          14. . The Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows; , that no single event shall be subject to adjustment under more than one subsection of this Section 14 (other than in the case of a dividend or distribution of different types of property, in which case Section 14(A), 14(B) or 14(C) shall apply to the appropriate parts of each such dividend or distribution); and , further that any issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant (in whole or in part) shall not itself give rise to any adjustment under this Section 14. For the purposes of convenience, adjustments are expressed in terms of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, without prejudice to Section 16.
Adjustments and Other Rights
provided
provided
          (A) . The Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted in the event the Company (i) pays a dividend or makes any other distribution with respect to its Common Stock solely in shares of its Common Stock, (ii) subdivides or reclassifies its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares or (iii) combines or reclassifies its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Warrantholder shall thereafter be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock that such Warrantholder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above, had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date with respect thereto. In such event, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the product of the Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock so issuable immediately thereafter. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such event. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Adjustments upon Certain Transactions
 
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
Ob = shares outstanding before the transaction in question
Oa = shares outstanding after the transaction in question
          (B) . If the Company shall fix a record date for the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution with respect to the Common Stock in cash (other than an Ordinary Cash Dividend or a dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(A) or Section 14(C)), the Exercise Price to be in effect after the record date for such dividend or distribution shall be determined by multiplying (x) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the last trading day preceding the first date (the "ex-date") on which the Common Stock first trades without the right to receive such dividend or distribution the Fair Market Value of the cash paid per share in such dividend or distribution, and the denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the last trading day before the ex-date. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(B), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. In the case of an adjustment for a cash dividend that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly dividend, the "Fair Market Value" of such dividend as paid per share would be reduced by the per share amount of the cash dividend that would constitute an Ordinary Cash Dividend. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustments contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Cash Dividends and Distributions
less
 
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
M = Fair Market Value immediately before ex-date
D = Fair Market Value of the dividend or distribution made per share of Common Stock
          (C) . If the Company shall fix a record date for the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution with respect to the Common Stock (other than an Ordinary Cash Dividend or a dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(A) or Section 14(B)), the Company shall distribute (for no additional consideration) such securities or property other than cash to the Warrantholder as such Warrantholder would have received had it held as of the applicable record date a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that were issuable under the Warrant as of such record date simultaneously with and on the same terms and conditions as such securities or other property are distributed to holders of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the payment of any dividend or distribution under this Section 14(C), the total number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant and the Exercise Price for the Warrant shall not be adjusted.
Non-Cash Dividends and Distributions
          (D) . If a publicly-announced tender offer made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the Common Stock shall be consummated, then the Exercise Price to be in effect after the tender offer is consummated shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding immediately before giving effect to the tender offer and (y) the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock as of the sixth trading day following the date on which such tender offer is consummated and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding after giving effect to the tender offer and (y) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of the sixth trading day following the date on which such tender offer is consummated, and (ii) the aggregate Fair Market Value of all cash and any other consideration paid or payable for Common Share Equivalents (the ""). Upon any adjustment

of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(D), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. For avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows, that the Exercise Price shall not be increased (and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant shall not be decreased) as a result of this paragraph 14(D).
provided
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the tender offer
Pa = exercise price per share after the tender offer
M = Fair Market Value on the sixth trading day immediately following the date on which the tender offer is consummated
E = Tender Amount (the aggregate amount paid in the tender offer)
Ob = Shares equivalents outstanding before giving effect to tender offer
Oa = Shares equivalents outstanding after giving effect to tender offer
          (E) . Except to the extent an adjustment in respect of such transaction is made in accordance with Section 14(F) below, in case of (a) any transaction in which the Company issues any shares of Common Stock, rights or options to acquire Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock (other than Qualifying Employee Stock), or (b) the amendment to or change in the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of the securities described under (a) above, in each case for an Effective Price that is lower than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the business day immediately prior to the date of pricing of such transaction (each, a
Discounted Issuances
 
""), the Exercise Price effective immediately following such Discounted Issuance shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price then in effect by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Share Equivalents outstanding on the business day immediately prior to the date of pricing of the Discounted Issuance plus (y) the total number of Common Shares that the aggregate Effective Price would purchase at the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on such business day, and the denominator of which is the sum of (x) the number of Common Share Equivalents outstanding on the business day immediately prior to the date of pricing of the Discounted Issuance plus (y) the total number of additional Common Shares offered for subscription or purchase or into which such convertible securities could be converted pursuant to the Discounted Issuance. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 14(E), the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be such number of shares issuable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment contemplated by this section can be expressed by formula as follows:
Discounted Issuance
Where:
Ub = shares underlying the Warrant before the adjustment
Ua = shares underlying the Warrant after the adjustment
Pb = exercise price per share before the adjustment
Pa = exercise price per share after the adjustment
F = shares that Effective Price could purchase at fair market value
I = number of shares issued or deemed issued
Ob = share equivalents outstanding on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect to the issuance
          (F) . In the case of any Reorganization in which any Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for or becomes the right to receive cash,

securities or other property (""), then, as a condition of such Reorganization:
Exchange Property
     (a) to the extent the Exchange Property consists of cash, securities or other property (other than Voting Securities), the Warrantholder's right to receive Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be converted into the right to exercise this Warrant to acquire the amount of Exchange Property (other than Voting Securities) which the Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (at the effective time of such Reorganization and after giving effect to any adjustments pursuant to this Section 14) would have been entitled to receive in such Reorganization; and
     (b) to the extent the Exchange Property consists of Voting Securities, the Warrantholder shall be issued a new Warrant on terms and conditions substantially identical to this Warrant to purchase a number of such Voting Securities for an Exercise Price per share calculated by (x) first, multiplying the initially adjusted number of Shares times the number of Voting Securities into which each share of Common Stock of the Company shall be converted in the Reorganization to arrive at the final adjusted number of Voting Securities of the other company issuable upon exercise of the Warrant and (y) second, dividing the initially adjusted Exercise Price per share by the number of Voting Securities into which each share of Common Stock of the Company shall be converted in the Reorganization to arrive at the final adjusted Exercise Price per Voting Security.
In the case of any Reorganization in which holders of Common Stock may make an election as between different types of Exchange Property, the Warrantholder shall be deemed to have elected to receive (unless Majority Holders otherwise notify the Company), first, Voting Securities, second, cash, and third other securities or property. The Company shall not affect any Reorganization unless the Company first shall have made appropriate provision to ensure that applicable provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions of this Article 14 and Article 15) and, if the Exchange Property includes any Registrable Securities, the Registration Rights Agreement shall immediately after giving effect to such Reorganization be assumed by and binding on the other party to the Reorganization (or the successor, parent company and/or issuer of such securities, as appropriate) and applicable to any Exchange Property deliverable upon the exercise of Warrants, pursuant to a customary assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Majority Holders. The Company shall notify the Warrantholder of any such proposed Reorganization Event reasonably prior to the consummation thereof so as to provide the Warrantholder with a reasonable opportunity to confirm compliance with the terms hereof and, if they elect, to exercise the Warrant in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof prior to consummation of the Reorganization; however, that in the case of a transaction which requires notice to be given to the holders of Common Stock of the Company, the Warrantholder shall be provided the same notice given to the holders of Common Stock of the Company.
provided,
 
          (G) . If the Company takes any action affecting the Common Stock, other than actions described in this Section 14, and in the opinion of the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, such action would materially adversely affect the exercise rights of the Warrantholder, then the Exercise Price for the Warrant and/or the number of Shares received upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted, to the extent permitted by law, in such a manner and at such time as the Board of Directors may determine in good faith to be equitable in the circumstances.
Certain Other Events
          (H) ; . All calculations under this Section 14 shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this Section 14 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a share of Common Stock, or more.
Rounding of Calculations
Minimum Adjustments
          (I) . Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock or other stock or property issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant or the Exercise Price is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company shall give notice to the Warrantholder of such adjustment or adjustments and shall deliver to the Warrantholder a statement setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock or other stock or property issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant and the Exercise Price after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made.
Notice of Adjustment
          (J) . If an adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder would reduce the Exercise Price to an amount below $0.01 then such adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder shall reduce the Exercise Price to $0.01 and not lower.

     (c) At all times after the Company has filed a registration statement with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act and until the Termination Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to continuously maintain in effect the registration statement of Common Stock under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and to use reasonable best efforts to file all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, all to the extent required to enable the Investor to be eligible to sell Registrable Securities (if any) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
     (d) The Company may require the Investor and each distributor of Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company information regarding such Person and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in connection with such registration.
     (e) The Investor agrees by having its Common Stock treated as Registrable Securities hereunder that, upon being advised in writing by the Company of the occurrence of an event pursuant to Section 6(a)(vi), the Investor will immediately
 
discontinue (and direct any other Persons making offers and sales of Registrable Securities to immediately discontinue) offers and sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement (other than those pursuant to a plan that is in effect prior to such time and that complies with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act) until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed and is furnished with a supplemented or amended Prospectus as contemplated by Section 6(a)(vi), and, if so directed by the Company, the Investor will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the Investor's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.
     (f) The Company may prepare and deliver an issuer free-writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in lieu of any supplement to a prospectus, and references herein to any "supplement" to a Prospectus shall include any such issuer free-writing prospectus. Neither the Investor nor any other seller of Registrable Securities may use a free-writing prospectus to offer or sell any such shares without the Company's prior written consent.
     (g) It is understood and agreed that any failure of the Company to file a registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto or to cause any such document to become or remain effective or usable within or for any particular period of time as provided in Section 2, or 6 or otherwise in this Agreement, due to reasons that are not reasonably within its control, or due to any refusal of the SEC to permit a registration statement or prospectus to become or remain effective or to be used because of unresolved SEC comments thereon (or on any documents incorporated therein by reference) despite the Company's good faith and reasonable best efforts to resolve those comments, shall not be a breach of this Agreement.
     (h) It is further understood and agreed that the Company shall not have any obligations under this Section 6 at any time on or after the Termination Date, unless an underwritten offering in which the Investor participates has been priced but not completed prior to the Termination Date, in which event the Company's obligations under this Section 6 shall continue with respect to such offering until it is so completed (but not more than 60 days after the commencement of the offering).
     (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to file a Registration Statement or include Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement unless it has received from the Investor, at least five days prior to the anticipated filing date of the Registration Statement, requested information required to be provided by the Investor for inclusion therein.

     Section 8. .
Indemnification
     (a) The Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Investor and each Person who controls the Investor (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs (including reasonable costs of investigation) and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Investor expressly for use therein. In connection with an underwritten offering in which the Investor participates conducted pursuant to a registration effected hereunder, the Company shall indemnify each participating underwriter and each Person who controls such underwriter (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Investor.
     (b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Investor is participating, the Investor shall furnish to the Company in writing such information as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, and shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its officers and directors and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs (including reasonable costs of investigation) and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that the same are made in reliance and in
 
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use therein.
     (c) Any party entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "") shall give written notice to the party indemnifying it (the "") of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification promptly after discovery by such Indemnified Party of any matters giving rise to a claim for indemnification. Such notice shall describe such claim in reasonable detail. Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Party except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnified Party shall permit such Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. An Indemnifying Party who is entitled to, and elects to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to one local counsel) for Parties indemnified (hereunder or otherwise) by such Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim (and all other claims arising out of the same circumstances), unless in the reasonable judgment of any Indemnified Party there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified Party which are in addition to or may conflict with those available to another Indemnified Party with respect to such claim, in which case such maximum number of counsel for all Indemnified Parties shall be two rather than one). If any Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and elects to, assume the defense of a claim, the Indemnified Party shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof, with counsel of its own choice, but, except as set forth above, the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to reimburse the Indemnified Party for the costs thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any claim, all Indemnified Parties shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnifying Party related to the claim, and each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the Indemnified Party without its written consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into or agree to any settlement relating to a claim or action for which any Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification by any indemnified Party hereunder unless such judgment or settlement imposes no ongoing obligations on any such Indemnified Party and includes as an unconditional term the giving, by all relevant claimants and plaintiffs to such Indemnified Party, a release, satisfactory in form and substance to such Indemnified Party, from all liabilities in respect of such claim or action for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to such indemnification. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable hereunder for any amount paid or payable or incurred pursuant to or in connection with any judgment entered or settlement effected with the consent of an Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party has also consented to such judgment or settlement.
Indemnified Party
Indemnifying Party
 
     (d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified Person or any officer, director or controlling Person of such indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of securities and the Termination Date but only with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities made before the Termination Date or during the period following the Termination Date referred to in Section 6(h).
     (e) If the indemnification provided for in or pursuant to this Section 8 is due in accordance with the terms hereof, but is held by a court to be unavailable or unenforceable in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each applicable indemnifying Person, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified Person, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying Person on the one hand and of the indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which result in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying Person on the one hand and of the indemnified Person on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying Person or by the indemnified Person, and by such Person's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. In no event shall the liability of the indemnifying Person be greater in amount than the amount for which such indemnifying Person would have been obligated to pay by way of indemnification if the indemnification provided for under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof had been available under the circumstances.
     Section 9. .
Securities Act Restrictions
     The Registrable Securities are restricted securities under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Investor shall not, directly or through others, offer or sell any Registrable Securities except pursuant to a Registration Statement as contemplated herein or pursuant to Rule 144 or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act, if available. Prior to any transfer of Registrable Securities other than pursuant to an effective registration statement, the Investor shall notify the Company of such transfer and the Company may require the Investor to provide, prior to such transfer, such evidence that the transfer will comply with the Securities Act (including written representations or an opinion of counsel) as the Company may reasonably request. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to any Registrable Securities that are to be transferred in contravention of this Agreement. Any certificates representing the Registrable Securities may bear a legend (and the Company's share registry may bear a notation) referencing the restrictions on transfer contained in this Agreement (and the Investment Agreement), until such time as such securities have ceased to be (or are to be transferred in a manner that results in their ceasing to be) Registrable Securities. Subject to the provisions of this Section 9, the Company will replace any such legended certificates with unlegended certificates promptly upon surrender of the
 
legended certificates to the Company or its designee, in order to facilitate a lawful transfer or at any time after such shares cease to be Registrable Securities.
     Section 10. .
Transfers of Rights
     (a) If the Investor transfers any Registrable Securities to a Permitted Transferee in accordance with the Investment Agreement, such Permitted Transferee shall, together with all other such Permitted Transferees and the Investor, also have the rights of the Investor under this Agreement with respect to such Registrable Securities, but only if the Permitted Transferee signs and delivers to the Company a written acknowledgment (in form and substance satisfactory to the Company) that it has joined with the Investor and the other Permitted Transferees as a party to this Agreement and has assumed, severally but not jointly, the rights and obligations of the Investor hereunder with respect to the Registrable Securities transferred to it by the Investor. Each such transfer shall be effective when (but only when) the Permitted Transferee has signed and delivered the written acknowledgment to the Company. Upon any such effective transfer, the Permitted Transferee shall automatically have the rights so transferred, and the Investor's obligations under this Agreement, and the rights with respect to the Registrable Securities not so transferred, shall continue. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Person who acquires securities transferred in violation of this Agreement or the Investment Agreement, or who acquires securities that are not or upon acquisition cease to be Registrable Securities, shall have any rights under this Agreement with respect to such securities, and such securities shall not have the benefits afforded hereunder to Registrable Securities.
     Section 11. .

Notice
Investor Screen
          (d) The Corporation agrees that, if at any time the Covered Debt is held by a trust (for example, where the Covered Debt is part of an issuance of trust preferred securities), a holder of the securities issued by such trust may enforce (including by instituting legal proceedings) this Replacement Capital Covenant directly against the Corporation as though such
 
holder owned Covered Debt directly, and such holder shall be deemed to be a holder of "" for purposes of this Replacement Capital Covenant for so long as the indebtedness held by such trust remains Covered Debt hereunder.
Covered Debt
          SECTION 4. . (a) The obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest date (the "") to occur of (i) October 15, 2048, or, if earlier, the date on which the Debentures are otherwise repaid, redeemed, defeased, remarketed, satisfied and discharged or purchased in full (in compliance with the terms of this Replacement Capital Covenant), (ii) the date, if any, on which the Holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding principal amount of the Covered Debt consent or agree in writing to the termination of this Replacement Capital Covenant and the obligations of the Corporation hereunder, (iii) the date on which the Corporation ceases to have any series of outstanding Eligible Senior Debt or Eligible Subordinated Debt (in each case without giving effect to the rating requirement in clause (b) of the definition of each such term) and (iv) the date on which the Debentures become accelerated due to the occurrence of an event of default. From and after the Termination Date, the obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be of no further force and effect.
Termination, Amendment and Waiver
Termination Date
          (b) This Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed by the Corporation with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding principal amount of the Covered Debt, provided that this Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed only by the Corporation (and without the consent of the Holders of the Covered Debt) if any of the following apply (it being understood that any such amendment or supplement may fall into one or more of the following): (i) the effect of such amendment or supplement is solely to impose additional restrictions on, or to eliminate certain of, the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the trustee or agent for such Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate to that effect, (ii) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the rights of the Covered Debtholders hereunder and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the trustee or agent for such Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Covered Debtholders, or (iii) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock, rights to acquire Common Stock, Debt Exchangeable for Common Equity and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities if, in the case of this clause (iii), an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards used to prepare the Corporation's financial statements becomes effective, which, as a result, causes the Corporation to believe that there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to eliminate Common Stock, rights to acquire Common Stock, Debt Exchangeable for Common Equity and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities would result in a reduction in the Corporation's earnings per share as calculated for financial reporting purposes.

For the purpose of clause (ii) in the preceding sentence, an
 
amendment or supplement that adds new types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities or modifies the requirements of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities will not be deemed materially adverse to the Covered Debtholders if, following such amendment or supplement, the replacement capital covenant would constitute a Qualifying Replacement Capital Covenant.
          (c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
          SECTION 5. . (a) This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Miscellaneous
          (b) This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be binding upon the Corporation and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Covered Debtholders as they exist from time-to-time (it being understood and agreed by the Corporation that any Person who is a Covered Debtholder shall retain its status as a Covered Debtholder for so long as the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money owned by such Person is Covered Debt and, if such Person initiates an action, claim or proceeding to enforce its rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant after the Corporation has violated its covenants in Section 2 and before the series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed held by such Person is no longer Covered Debt, such Person's rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall not terminate by reason of such series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed no longer being Covered Debt). Other than the Covered Debtholders as provided in the previous sentence, no other Person shall have any rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant or be deemed a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant.
          (c) All demands, notices, requests and other communications to the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be deemed to have been duly given and made if in writing and (i) if served by personal delivery upon the Corporation, on the day so delivered (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) or (ii) if delivered by registered post or certified mail, return receipt requested, or sent to the Corporation by a national or international courier service, on the date of receipt by the Corporation (or, if such date of receipt is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), and in each case to the Corporation at the address set forth below, or at such other address as the Corporation may thereafter notify to Covered Debtholders or post on its website (or any other similar electronic platform generally available to the public) as the address for notices under this Replacement Capital Covenant:
