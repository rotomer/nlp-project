Certain Further Payments by Company
.
In the event that any amount or benefit paid or distributed to Executive pursuant to this Agreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid or distributed to Executive by the Company or any affiliate (collectively, the "Covered Payments"), are or become subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed, the Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified in this Section an additional amount (the "Tax Reimbursement Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive with respect to such Covered Payments, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Covered Payments and any Federal, state and local income tax and other tax on the Tax Reimbursement Payment provided for by this Section, but before deduction for any Federal, state or local income or employment tax withholding on such Covered Payments, shall be equal to the amount of the Covered Payments.

(ii)
Applicable Rules

such Covered Payments will be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to the Effective Date or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants"), the Company has a reasonable basis to conclude that such Covered Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments" or represent reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base amount," or such "parachute payments" are otherwise not subject to such Excise Tax, and
(A)
the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
(B)
For purposes of determining the amount of the Tax Reimbursement Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay: (A) Federal income taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of Federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, and (B) any applicable state and local income and other taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in Federal incomes taxes which could be obtained from the deduction of such state or local taxes if paid in such year.

(iv)
Repayment or Additional Payment in Certain Circumstances
.
In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the Tax Reimbursement Payment made, Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of such prior Tax Reimbursement Payment that would not have been paid if such lesser Excise Tax had been applied in initially calculating such Tax Reimbursement Payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Tax Reimbursement Payment to be repaid to the Company has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax authority, repayment thereof shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to Executive by the applicable tax authority. Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expenses thereof) if Executive's good faith claim for refund or credit is denied.
(A)
Repayment

In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Tax Reimbursement Payment is made (including, but not limited to, by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Tax Reimbursement Payment), the Company shall make an additional Tax Reimbursement Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalty payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
(B)
Additional Tax Reimbursement Payment
.
The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) provided for in this Section 6 shall be paid to Executive not later than 10 business days following the payment of the Covered Payments; provided, however, that if the amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof) cannot be finally determined on or before the date on which payment is due, the Company shall pay to Executive by such date an amount estimated in good faith by the Accountants to be the minimum amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment and shall pay the remainder of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later than 45 calendar days after payment of the related Covered Payment. To the extent that the amount of the estimated Tax Reimbursement Payment exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, Executive shall repay such excess to the Company on the fifth business day after written demand by the Company for payment.

Full Discharge of Company Obligations

The Company shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to enforce or waive the terms of this provision in connection with the Restriction Period. If the Company exercises its right to enforce this provision for the Restriction Period, the Company, no later than 60 days following the Company's receipt of the Executive's written notice of Voluntary Termination, will provide Executive with written notice of its intent to enforce, and will pay Executive one year of Executive's then current Base Salary and one year of Executive's then current Target Bonus as compensation for the Restriction Period. Such amount shall be paid to Executive in equal monthly installments during the Restriction Period. Executive agrees that the terms of the Restriction Period are reasonable and that this compensation is above and beyond any amounts necessary to support the terms of the Restriction Period as set forth herein.
(a)
Noncompetition
.
Without the prior written consent of the Company, except to the extent required by an order of a court having competent jurisdiction or under subpoena from an appropriate government agency, Executive shall not disclose to any third person, or permit the use of for the benefit of any person or any entity other than The Company or its affiliates, any trade secrets, customer lists, information regarding product development, marketing plans, sales plans, management organization information (including data and other information relating to members of the Board and management), operating policies or manuals, business plans, financial records, or other financial, organizational, commercial, business, sales, marketing, technical, product or employee information relating to the Company or its affiliates or information designated as confidential, proprietary, and/or a trade secret, or any other information relating to the Company or its affiliates that Executive knows from the circumstances, in good faith and good conscience, should be treated as confidential, or any information that the Company or its affiliates may receive belonging to customers, agents or others who do business with the Company or its affiliates, except to the extent that any such information previously has been disclosed to the public by the Company or is in the public domain (other than by reason of Executive's violation of this Section 9(b)).

(d)
Company Property
.
Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations of Executive with respect to noncompetition, confidentiality, nonsolicitation, and Company property relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any of the terms of such covenants and obligations will cause the Company irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore, Executive agrees that the Company (i) shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) restraining Executive from committing any violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9, and (ii) shall have no further obligation to pay unearned compensation, incentive awards, unvested awards, or bonus payments to Executive hereunder following any material violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 9. These remedies are cumulative and are in addition to any other rights and remedies the Company may have at law or in equity. In connection with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, Executive represents that his/her economic means and circumstances are such that such provisions will not prevent him/her from providing for himself/herself and his/her family on a basis satisfactory to him/her. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement following a Change of Control.

In applying the provisions of Sections 5 and 6, continued participation in the health insurance benefit plans shall be in two parts: (i) the first part shall continue from the date of termination to the end of the 18-month period during which Executive would have been eligible for continuation coverage under Section 601 et. seq. of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and (ii) the second part shall commence on the first day after the end of the period described in subclause (i) and shall end on the last day of the applicable Welfare Benefits Continuation period. Continued participation in Welfare Benefits Continuation provided under Section 6 other than with respect to health benefits shall also be provided in two parts: (i) the first part shall continue from the Date of Termination until the second anniversary of Executive's Date of Termination, and (ii) the second part shall commence on the day immediately following such second anniversary and continuing until the end of the applicable Continuation period. To the extent Welfare Benefits Continuation consists of reimbursement of expenses, such reimbursement shall be paid within 60 days of the submission of reasonably satisfactory evidence of such expenses, in accordance with the generally applicable requirements under the applicable arrangement, but in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such expenses are incurred. Any amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement of welfare benefits or in-kind benefits provided during any calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other calendar year.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of Sections 5 and 6, Executive shall not be deemed to have had a termination of employment unless Executive shall have also had a separation from service, as determined in accordance with any policies or practices that the Company shall adopt in accordance with, or as otherwise determined pursuant to, Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.
