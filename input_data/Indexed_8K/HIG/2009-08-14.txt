Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 13, 2009, the non-management members of the Board of Directors of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Company") approved modifications to the compensation arrangements of two of the Company's "named executive officers" whose compensation was disclosed in the Company's 2009 Proxy Statement ("NEOs"), Lizabeth H. Zlatkus, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and John C. Walters, President and Chief Operating Officer, Life Operations. The modifications as approved reduced the overall target compensation of these NEOs, and altered their mix of compensation elements, as compared to their compensation described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in the Companys 2009 Proxy Statement, as explained below. In a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company on June 26, 2009, the Company reported that it had entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("Treasury") pursuant to the Trouble d Asset Relief Programs ("TARP") Capital Purchase Program. In accordance with that agreement and the interim final rule (the "Interim Final Rule") issued by Treasury regarding permissible compensation arrangements of TARP recipients under Section 111 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ("EESA"), the compensation arrangements applicable to Ms. Zlatkus and Mr. Walters are modified, effective August 16, 2009, in order to provide those employees with compensation that complies with EESA and the Interim Final Rule. In accordance with EESA and the Interim Final Rule, none of the Company's NEOs may accrue bonuses or certain other forms of incentive compensation, other than TARP-compliant restricted stock and stock unit awards, while they are subject to the EESA compensation restrictions. Accordingly, the compensation arrangements of Ms. Zlatkus and Mr. Walters have been restructured to eliminate prohibited incentive compensation. These modifications resulted in a decrease of 28% in Ms. Zlatkus and Mr. Walters annual target total compensation opportunities. Under the restructured arrangements, a larger portion of total compensation will be credited as stock units designed to comply with the Interim Final Rule, the ultimate value of which will depend upon the performance of the Companys stock. For each of Ms. Zlatkus and Mr. Walters, the restructured total compensation opportunity will consist of the following elements:  Annual cash base salary of $975,000, effective from August 16, 2009.  TARP-compliant deferred stock units, to be credited each regular pay period effective from August 16, 2009 at an annual rate of $1,195,000. The amount to be credited as deferred stock units will be equal to a ratable portion of the $1,195,000 each pay period, with the sum of the amounts accrued for a quarter being notionally converted into shares of the Companys common stock on a quarterly basis based on accruals for the prior q uarter. These deferred stock units, to be provided through The Hartford Deferred Stock Unit Plan (which plan is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference), will upon crediting be fully vested, and will be settled in cash paid to the executive two years after the date of such conversion based on the settlement date closing price per share of the Companys common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. The deferred stock units can be canceled in the event of termination for cause to the extent permitted by EESA and the Interim Final Rule.  A TARP-compliant long-term restricted stock unit award. While they are subject to the EESA compensation restrictions, Ms. Zlatkus and Mr. Walters may each accrue bonus and incentive awards in the form of long-term restricted stock or restricted stock units that (i) do not vest (with limited exceptions) unless they remain employed for at least a further two years, (ii) do not exceed one-third of their total a nnual compensation, and (iii) are only payable as the Companys TARP financial assistance is repaid (as each 25% of the Companys total TARP obligation is repaid, 25% of the award can be paid). Accordingly, restricted stock unit awards, designed to comply with the requirements of EESA and the Interim Final Rule, were approved for each of Ms. Zlatkus and Mr. Walters with a grant-date value of $465,000, representing permissible awards for the partial year from June 26, 2009 through December 31, 2009. These awards, to be provided through The Hartford Deferred Stock Unit Plan, will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and are to be settled on a schedule tied to the Companys repayment of TARP funds. The awards are to be granted effective on the second business day following the filing of the Companys Quarterly Report on SEC Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2009. All elements of these modified compensation packages for Ms. Zlatkus and Mr. Walters w ould be further adjusted if required to comply with EESA and the Interim Final Rule.

Units
"
The Committee may, in its discretion, award to an Employee contractual rights to receive in accordance with the Plan cash equal to the value of a number of whole and/or fractional shares of Stock (the "Deferred Units") determined in accordance with this Section 3.1. With respect to each Employee to whom Deferred Units will be granted, the Committee shall establish a dollar amount to be provided in Deferred Units in respect of services performed in each regular pay period. Deferred Units shall be earned ratably over a year (or such portion thereof as shall be specified by the Committee), based on the number of regular pay periods occurring during such year (or specified period). The sum of the amounts earned in respect of each payroll period shall be applied on a quarterly basis (or more frequently if so required by Subsequent Guidance) to determine the number of Deferred Units to be credited to the Participant's Account, by dividing such accumulated sum of payroll credits for the preceding calendar quarter (or shorter period if required by Subsequent Guidance) by the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the second business day following the filing of the Company's periodic reports on SEC Form 10-Q or 10-K applicable to or filed immediately following the calendar quarter in which the amounts are earned (each, a "Grant Date"). Should Subsequent Guidance require that Deferred Units be credited more frequently than on a quarterly basis, the Committee shall determine the applicable Grant Date, and the formula set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied using the Fair Market Value of the Stock on such Grant Date. Deferred Units will be credited as of a Grant Date in respect of any earned pay credits regardless of whether the Participant's employment shall have terminated as of the applicable Grant Date.
3.1
Award of Deferred Units
.
The number of whole and/or fractional Deferred Units awarded to a Participant pursuant to this Article III as of each applicable Grant Date shall be credited to the Participant's Account as of such date.
3.2
Crediting of Deferred Units to Account
.
. The rights of a Participant with respect to any Deferred Units credited to his or her Account shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable at all times. To the extent provided in Article VI, a Participant shall become entitled to receive cash corresponding to any Deferred Units credited to the Participant's Account on the applicable date identified in Article VI. Notwithstanding the above, the Deferred Units credited to a Participant's Account shall be forfeited should the Participant be Terminated for Cause, to the extent permitted by EESA and other applicable state and federal law.
3.3
Vesting of Deferred Units
Except as provided below, as of the Award Date, the Committee may, in its discretion, award to an Employee contractual rights to receive in accordance with the Plan cash equal to the value of a number of whole and/or fractional shares of Stock (the "Restricted Units"). Unlike Deferred Units, Restricted Units are intended to be incentive compensation that vests over time (which is provided in accordance with applicable exceptions under EESA), and consequently are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined in regulations under Section 83 of the Code) in the manner specified below.
4.1
Award of Restricted Units
.
The number of whole and/or fractional Restricted Units awarded to a Participant pursuant to this Article IV as of the Award Date shall be credited to the Participant's Account as of such date.
4.2
Crediting of Restricted Units to Account
.
Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, a Participant's rights with respect to Restricted Units shall vest on the Normal Vesting Date, although a Participant's right to payment of such Restricted Units, even if vested, shall be restricted or postponed to the extent required by EESA or specified by the Committee. To the extent provided in Article VI, the Participant shall become entitled to receive cash corresponding to such vested Restricted Units credited to the Participant's Account on the applicable date identified in Article VI.
4.3
Vesting of Restricted Units
.
In the event of a Participant's termination of employment with all Participating Companies prior to the Normal Vesting Date (i) due to death or (ii) due to Total Disability, the Restricted Units credited to the Participant's Account as of the date of such termination shall, unless otherwise provided at the time of award, become immediately vested and nonforfeitable. In the event of a Participant's termination of employment with all Participating Companies for any other reason, any Restricted Units credited to the Participant's Account that have not become vested on or before the date of such termination shall be forfeited, unless and solely to the extent that the Committee determines otherwise in its sole discretion and in accordance with the applicable provisions of EESA, provided however that, unless otherwise provided by the Committee or prohibited by EESA, Restricted Units shall, in the event of a Participant's Retirement, be vested pro rata in the same manner as restricted units under the Incentive Stock Plan. A Participant shall be deemed to have terminated employment for purposes of this Plan at the same time as the Participant is deemed to have terminated employment for purposes of the Incentive Stock Plan. Restricted Units forfeited by a Participant pursuant to this Section immediately shall be deducted from the Participant's Account Notwithstanding the above, the Restricted Units credited to a Participant's Account shall be forfeited should the Participant be Terminated for Cause, to the extent permitted by EESA and other applicable state and federal law.
A.
Termination of Employment
.
.
As soon as practicable after any dividend is paid on the Stock, a Participant's Account shall be credited with additional Deferred Units. All Dividend Equivalents payable in respect of Deferred Units shall be deemed reinvested in that number of Deferred Units determined based on the Fair Market Value on the date the corresponding dividend on the Stock is payable to stockholders.
5.1
Dividend Equivalents on Deferred Units

5.2
Dividend Equivalents on Restricted Units

5.3
Treatment of Units Credited in respect of Dividend Equivalents
.
In the event that a stock dividend is paid on the Company's Stock, the appropriate Dividend Equivalent for purposes of this Article V shall be determined in accordance with Section 8.3 hereof.
5.4
Non-Cash Dividends

Except as otherwise provided herein, as soon as practicable after, and in any event within 90 days after, the second anniversary of a Grant Date (or, in the event that Grant Dates are more frequent than quarterly, the second anniversary of the end of the calendar quarter during which the Grant Date occurs), the Company shall pay to a Participant cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value on such second anniversary of the number of full and fractional shares of Stock corresponding to the number of Deferred Units credited to the Participant's Account as of such Grant Date(s).

In such case the Company shall pay to such Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) cash equal to the Fair Market Value of a number of full and fractional shares of Stock corresponding to the number of Deferred Units and Restricted Units credited to the Participant's Account, based on the Fair Market Value on the date of death or Total Disability, as applicable. If such earlier payment is not permitted by EESA or regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code, payment in respect of such Participant's Units shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1 or 6.2.as applicable.
