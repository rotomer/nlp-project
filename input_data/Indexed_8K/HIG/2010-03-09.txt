             All meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be held at such place or places, within or outside the state of Delaware, as may be fixed by the Corporation's Board of Directors (the Board, and each member thereof a Director) from time to time or as shall be specified in the respective notices thereof.
1.1
Place of Stockholders Meetings.
 
             An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at such place (within or outside the state of Delaware), date and hour as shall be determined by the Board and designated in the notice thereof.
1.2
Day and Time of Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
 
             (a) At each annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect the members of the Board for the succeeding year.  At any such annual meeting any business properly brought before the meeting may be transacted.
1.3
Purposes of Annual Meetings.
 
(b)           To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business (other than nominations of directors, which must be made in compliance with, and shall be exclusively governed by, Section 2.2 of these By-laws) must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this Section 1.3(b) and at the time of the annual meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.3(b).
 
For any such business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the stockholder must have given written notice thereof, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary, not later than the close of business 90 days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting (or, if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, not later than the later of (i) the close of business 90 days prior to the date of such annual meeting or (ii) if the first public announcement of the date of such advanced or delayed annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, ten days after the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting).  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

Any such notice shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting:

(c)           Notwithstanding anything in these By-laws to the contrary: (i) no business (other than the nominations of directors, which must be made in compliance with, and shall be exclusively governed by, Section 2.2 of these By-laws) shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.3(b) above; and (ii) unless otherwise required by law, if a stockholder intending to bring business before an annual meeting in accordance with Section 1.3(b) above does not (A) timely provide the notifications contemplated by clause (5) of Section 1.3(b) above, or (B) timely appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to present the proposed business, such business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such business may have been received by the Corporation or any other person or entity.
 
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the presiding officer of any annual meeting of stockholders shall have the power and duty to determine whether any business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting was proposed in accordance with the foregoing procedures (including whether the stockholder solicited or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholders proposal in compliance with such stockholders representation as required by clause (4) of Section 1.3(b)) and if any business is not proposed in compliance with Section 1.3(b), to declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded.  The requirements of Section 1.3(b) and this Section 1.3(c) shall apply to any business to be brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder other than nominations of directors, which must be made in compliance with, and shall be exclusively governed by, Section 2.2 of these By-laws and other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).  For purposes of these By-laws, public announcement shall mean disclosure in a press release of the Corporation reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable news service or in a document publicly filed or furnished by the Corporation with or to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(b) of the Exchange Act.
 
           Except as otherwise expressly required by applicable law, special meetings of the stockholders or of any class or series entitled to vote may be called for any purpose or purposes by the Chairman or by a majority vote of the entire Board, to be held at such place (within or outside the state of Delaware), date and hour as shall be determined by the Board and designated in the notice thereof.

law, notice of any adjourned meeting of stockholders need not be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  Any notice, if mailed, shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at the address for notices to such stockholder as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
 
 
           (a) Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, at any meeting of the stockholders, the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of votes thereat shall constitute a quorum for the entire meeting, notwithstanding the withdrawal of stockholders entitled to cast a sufficient number of votes in person or by proxy to reduce the number of votes represented at the meeting below a quorum.  Shares of the Corporation's stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in an election of the directors of such other corporation is held by the Corporation, shall neither be counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum nor entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders.
1.6
Quorum of Stockholders.
 
(b)           At any meeting of the stockholders at which a quorum shall be present, a majority of those present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice other than announcement at the meeting.  In the absence of a quorum, the officer presiding thereat shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present.  Notice of any adjourned meeting other than announcement at the meeting shall not be required to be given, except as provided in Section 1.6(d) below and except where expressly required by applicable law.
 
(c)           At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting originally called, but only those stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting as originally noticed shall be entitled to vote at any adjournment or adjournments thereof unless a new record date is fixed by the Board.
 
(d)           If an adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given in the manner specified in Section 1.5 to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
 
             The Chairman or, in his or her absence, another officer of the Corporation designated by the Chairman, shall preside at meetings of the stockholders.  The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, or in the absence of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary shall so act, or if neither is present, then the presiding officer may appoint a person to act as secretary of the meeting.
1.7
Chairman and Secretary of Meeting.
 
            (a) Except as otherwise expressly required by applicable law, at every meeting of the stockholders each stockholder shall be entitled to the number of votes specified in the Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designations providing for the creation of any series of Preferred Stock, in person or by proxy, for each share of stock standing in his or her name on the Stock Ledger (as defined in Section 5.2) on the date fixed pursuant to
1.8
Voting by Stockholders.
 
4
 
the provisions of Section 5.6 as the record date for the determination of the stockholders who shall be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at such meeting.
 
(b)           When a quorum is present at any meeting of the stockholders, all questions shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting power of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at such meeting, unless a question is one upon which by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
 
(c)           Except as required by applicable law, the vote at any meeting of stockholders on any question need not be by ballot, unless so directed by the presiding officer of the meeting.  On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his or her attorney-in- fact, if authorized by proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted.
 
             Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders may vote either in person or by his or her attorney-in-fact or proxy.
1.9
Proxies.
 
             (a) The election of Directors and any other vote by ballot at any meeting of the stockholders shall be supervised by one or more inspectors. Such inspectors may be appointed by the Chairman before the meeting.  If the Chairman shall not have so appointed such inspectors or if one or both inspectors so appointed shall refuse to serve or shall not be present, such appointment shall be made by the officer presiding at the meeting.  Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.
1.10
Inspectors.

The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of the duties of the inspectors.
 
(c)           If there are three or more inspectors, the act of a majority shall govern.  On request of the officer presiding at such meeting, the inspectors shall make a report of any challenge, question or matter determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them.  Any report or certificate made by them shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated and of the vote as certified by them, and such report or certificate shall be filed with the minutes of such meeting.
 
             (a) At least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, the Secretary shall cause to be prepared and made a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.

             (a) Proxies and ballots that identify the votes of specific stockholders shall be kept in confidence by the tabulators and the inspectors of election unless (i) there is an opposing solicitation with respect to the election or removal of Directors, (ii) disclosure is required by applicable law, (iii) a stockholder expressly requests or otherwise authorizes disclosure, or (iv) the Corporation concludes in good faith that a bona fide dispute exists as to the authenticity of one or more proxies, ballots or votes, or as to the accuracy of any tabulation of such proxies, ballots or votes.
1.12
Confidential Voting.
 
(b)           The tabulators and inspectors of election and any authorized agents or other persons engaged in the receipt, count and tabulation of proxies and ballots shall be advised of this By-law and instructed to comply herewith.
 
(c)           The inspectors of election shall certify, to the best of their knowledge based on due inquiry, that proxies and ballots have been kept in confidence as required by this Section 1.12.

2.             DIRECTORS.

hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal from office in accordance with these By-laws or any applicable law or pursuant to an order of a court.  Directors need not be stockholders of the Corporation or citizens of the United States of America.
 
 
(b)           Nominations of persons for election as Directors may be made by (i) the Board or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.2 and at the time of the stockholders meeting, who shall be entitled to vote for the election of Directors at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2 (clause (ii) being the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors at a meeting of stockholders).
 
(c)           Any stockholder entitled to vote for the election of Directors may nominate a person or persons for election as Directors only if written notice of such stockholders intent to make such nomination is given in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary not later than (i) with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of stockholders, the close of business 90 days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting (or, if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, not later than the later of (A) the close of business 90 days prior to the date of such annual meeting or (B) if the first public announcement of the date of such advanced or delayed annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, ten days after the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting) and (ii) with respect to a special meeting of stockholders at which the Board of Directors gives notice that Directors are to be elected, the close of business on the seventh day after the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting.  In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or special meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.  In the case of a special meeting of stockholders at which the Board of Directors gives notice that Directors are to be elected, stockholders may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election only as provided in this paragraph and only for such position(s) as are specified in the Corporations notice of meeting as being up for election at such meeting.
 
Each such notice of a stockholders intent to make a nomination shall set forth:

(d)           No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these By-laws. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the presiding officer of any meeting of stockholders to elect Directors or the Board may, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholders nominee(s) without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (3) of Section 2.2(c); and if the presiding officer or the Board should so determine, it shall be so declared to the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.  Notwithstanding anything in these By-laws to the contrary, unless otherwise required by law, if a stockholder intending to make a nomination at an annual
 
8
 
or special meeting in accordance with this Section 2.2 does not (A) timely provide the notifications contemplated by clause (5) of Section 2.2(c), or (B) timely appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to present the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nomination may have been received by the Corporation or any other person or entity.
 
(e)           Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, any stockholder intending to make a nomination at an annual or special meeting in accordance with this Section 2.2, and each related beneficial owner, if any, shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in these By-laws; provided, however, that any references in these By-laws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations made or intended to be made in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 2.2(b).
 
(f)           Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock of the Company to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
 
(g)           Submission of Questionnaire; Representation and Agreement. To be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a Director of the Corporation, a person must deliver (not later than the deadline prescribed for delivery of notice under Section 2.2 of these By-laws) to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation a written questionnaire with respect to the background and qualification of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made (which questionnaire shall be provided by the Secretary upon written request) and a written representation and agreement (in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request) that such person: (i) is not and will not become a party to (A) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a Director of the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a "Voting Commitment") that has not been disclosed to the Corporation or (B) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such persons ability to comply, if elected as a Director of the Corporation, with such persons duties under applicable law; (ii) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a Director that has not been disclosed therein; and (iii) in such persons individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a Director of the Corporation, and will comply with, applicable law and corporate governance, conflict of interest, corporate opportunity, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Corporation that are applicable to Directors generally.  The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent Director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholders understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
 
9
 
(h)           At each meeting of the stockholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, each Director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the Director, excluding abstentions, provided that if the number of Director nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected, the Directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast.  For purposes of this Section 2.2, a majority of the votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted for a Director must exceed the number of votes against that Director.
 
             (a) Any Director may resign from office at any time by delivering a written resignation to the Chairman or the Secretary.  The resignation will take effect at the time specified therein, or, if no time is specified, at the time of its receipt by the Corporation.  The acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective, unless expressly so provided in the resignation.
2.3
Vacancies on Board.
 
(b)           Any vacancy and any newly created Directorship resulting from any increase in the authorized number of Directors may be filled by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, though less than a quorum, and any Director so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election of Directors by the stockholders and until a successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal from office in accordance with these By-laws or any applicable law or pursuant to an order of a court.  If there are no Directors in office, then an election of Directors may be held in the manner provided by applicable law.
 
             (a) The Board may hold its meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the state of Delaware, at such places as from time to time may be determined by the Board or as may be designated in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.
2.4

(b)           Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such times and at such places as from time to time shall be determined by the Board.

(d)           Special meetings of the Board shall be held whenever called by direction of the Chairman or at the request of a majority of the Directors then in office.
 
(e)           Members of the Board or any Committee of the Board may participate in a meeting of the Board or Committee, as the case may be, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
 
(f)           The Secretary or any Assistant Secretary shall give notice to each Director of any meeting of the Board by mailing the same at least two days before the meeting or by telegram, electronic mail or facsimile transmission or delivering the same not later than the day before the
 
10
 
meeting.  Such notice need not include a statement, of the business to be transacted at, or the purpose of,any such meeting.  Any and all business may be transacted at any meeting of the Board.  No notice of any adjourned meeting need be given.  No notice to or waiver by any Director shall be required with respect to any meeting at which the Director is present.
 
 
             Except as otherwise expressly required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, at any meeting of the Board, the presence of at least one-third of the entire Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; but if there shall be less than a quorum at any meeting of the Board, a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time.  Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the vote of a majority of the Directors present (and not abstaining) at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be necessary for the approval and adoption of any resolution or the approval of any act of the Board.
2.5
Quorum and Action.
 
             The Chairman or, in the absence of the Chairman, a member of the Board selected by the members present, shall preside at meetings of the Board.  The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the Secretarys absence the presiding officer may appoint a secretary of the meeting.
2.6
Presiding Officer and Secretary of Meeting.
 
             Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any Committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or Committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or Committee.
2.7
Action by Consent without Meeting.
 
             By resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, the Board shall elect, from among its members, individuals to serve on the Standing Committees established by this Section 2.8.

Each Committee shall keep a record of all its proceedings and report the same to the Board.  One-third of the members of a Committee, but not less than two, shall constitute a quorum, and the act of a majority of the members of a Committee present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Committee.

provided
however
 
(b)           Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article 4, if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Potential Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article 4 (with respect to actions or failures to act occurring prior to such Change in Control) upon submission of a request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with Section 4.5(a)(i),, and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination.

18

(ii)           If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made, pursuant to Section 4.5(a) or (b), that the Potential Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (A) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law.  In the event that payment of indemnification is not made within five days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 4.5(a) or (b), the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the Corporation's obligation to pay to the Indemnitee such
indemnification.

(iv)           In the event that the Indemnitee or Potential Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 4.5(c), seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Article 4, such person shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration.  If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that such person is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by such person in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be prorated accordingly.
