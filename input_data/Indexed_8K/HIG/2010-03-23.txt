     Under the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company's ability to declare or pay dividends or make distributions on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, shares of its common stock, or any junior stock or parity stock currently outstanding or issued in the future, will be subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Company does not pay in full or declare and set aside for payment in full all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are more fully set forth in the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights described in Item 5.03 below and attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the form of certificate for the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.5 and incorporated herein by reference.
     In connection with the issuance of the Depositary Shares, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights (the "Certificate of Designations") setting out the form and the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, which amended the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, effective immediately upon filing on March 23, 2010. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the Company's liquidation, winding-up or dissolution:
      senior to all common stock of the Company and, if issued, the Company's Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock and to each other class of other capital stock or series of preferred stock issued after the original issue date of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock unless the terms of that stock expressly provide that it ranks senior to, or equally with, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock;
 - 
      equally with the Company's Series E Preferred Stock, which the Company intends to repurchase with the net proceeds of the common stock, Depositary Shares and Notes offerings, together with available funds, subject to the approval of the Treasury Department, and equally with any class of capital stock or series of preferred stock established after the original issue date of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series will rank equally with the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock;
 - 
      junior to each class of capital stock or series of preferred stock established after the original issue date of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series will rank senior to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock; and
 - 
      junior to the Company's and its subsidiaries' existing and future indebtedness (including, in the case of the Company's subsidiaries, trade payables).
 - 
     The Company will pay cumulative dividends on each share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at a rate of 7.25% per annum on the initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Dividends will accrue and cumulate from the date of issuance and, to the extent that the Company is legally permitted to pay dividends and its board of directors declares a dividend payable, the Company will, from July 1, 2010 until and including January 1, 2013 pay dividends on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, in cash and (whether or not declared prior to that date) on April 1, 2013 will pay or deliver, as the case may be, dividends in cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination thereof, at its election.
     Each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock on April 1, 2013 if not earlier converted at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Certificate of Designations). The number of shares issuable upon mandatory conversion of each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be a variable amount based on the average of the daily volume weighted average price per share of the Company's common stock during a specified period of 20 consecutive trading days with the number of shares of common stock ranging from 29.536 to 36.036 per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.
     At any time prior to March 15, 2013, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may elect to convert their shares at the minimum conversion rate, and will receive accrued and unpaid dividends for past
Table of Contents
dividend periods but will not receive accrued and unpaid dividends for the current dividend period. Upon a fundamental change (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may elect to convert their shares at a fundamental change conversion rate (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), and will receive accrued and unpaid dividends. The Company may elect to pay accrued and unpaid dividends payable in connection with any conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof.
     Except as required by law or the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which will include the Certificate of Designations for the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, the holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will have no voting rights (other than with respect to certain matters regarding the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock or when dividends payable on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have not been paid for an aggregate of six quarterly divided periods, or more, whether or not consecutive, as provided in the Certificate of Designations).
     The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate of Designations, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

prospectus supplement, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to
 
contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
          (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in the Pricing Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.

          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a)
 
above, the aggregate number of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Designated Securities to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Designated Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to such Pricing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
     12. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated due to the failure of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP to deliver its opinion to the Representatives pursuant to Section 8(c) or pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities governed by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 7 and 9
 
hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than in respect of a breach of the Pricing Agreement by any Underwriter of Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Designated Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto.

     13. In all dealings under the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Securities, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties thereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any such Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in such Pricing Agreement.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: General Counsel; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be

     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the
 
Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter of Designated Securities will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
 
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Underwriters on
 
the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
   10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in the Pricing Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
Underwriter
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Designated Securities to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been
 
made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Designated Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to such Pricing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
     12. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated due to the failure of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP to deliver its opinion to the Representatives pursuant to Section 8(c) or pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities governed by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than in respect of a breach of the Pricing Agreement by any Underwriter of Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further
 
liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Designated Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
     13. In all dealings under the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Securities, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties thereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any such Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in such Pricing Agreement.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: General Counsel; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request.

No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. Time shall be of the essence for each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "" shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks in the City of New York are authorized or required to close.

     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (including the Form T-1), the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter of Designated Securities will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or
 
liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section
 
9 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at
 
which the Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus
 
which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in the Pricing Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
Underwriter
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to such Pricing
 
Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
     12. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated due to the failure of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP to deliver its opinion to the Representatives pursuant to Section 8(c) or pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities governed by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than in respect of a breach of the Pricing Agreement by any Underwriter of Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
     13. In all dealings under the Pricing Agreement applicable to the Designated Securities, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties thereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any such Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly
 
or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in such Pricing Agreement.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: General Counsel; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of its clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their clients.

     (e) The issuance by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares of Series F Preferred Stock at the Minimum Conversion Rate in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed effective immediately prior to the close of business on the day (the "") of receipt by the Transfer Agent of the notice of conversion and other documents, if any, set forth in Section 6(b), compliance with Section 6(c), if applicable, and the surrender by such Holder or such Holder's designee of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be converted (if held in certificated form), duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto).

Conversion Date
     (b) The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon any such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on the applicable Conversion Date. No allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 11, shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record as of any date prior to such applicable Conversion Date. Prior to such applicable Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock (including without limitation voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock) by virtue of holding shares of Series F Preferred Stock.
     (c) Shares of Series F Preferred Stock duly converted in accordance herewith, or otherwise reacquired by the Corporation, shall resume the status of authorized and unissued Preferred Stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance (that any such cancelled shares of Series F Preferred Stock may be reissued only as shares of any series of Preferred Stock other than Series F Preferred Stock).
provided
     (d) In the event that a Holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such Series F Preferred Stock should be registered, the Corporation shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder of such Series F Preferred Stock as shown on the records of the Corporation. In the case of a Mandatory Conversion, in the event that shares of the Preferred Stock are then held in certificated form, in the event that a Holder of Series F Preferred Stock shall not by written notice to the Company elect to receive shares of Common Stock deliverable upon such Mandatory Conversion in certificated form, the name in which such shares should be registered and the address to which the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock should be sent, the Corporation shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in book-entry form, in the name of the Holder of such Series F Preferred Stock as shown on the records of the Corporation.
 
     (a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or shares held in the treasury of the Corporation, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series F Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Share Cap times the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock then outstanding.
SECTION 9
. Reservation of Common Stock.
     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock reacquired and held in the treasury of the Corporation (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such treasury shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).
     (c) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).
     (d) Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by, any governmental authority.

SECTION 10
. Fractional Shares.
     (b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock or any other common stock or ADRs included in the Exchange Property otherwise issuable in respect of any Mandatory Conversion, Optional Conversion or Fundamental Change Conversion or as a result of the election of the Corporation to pay a dividend in shares of Common Stock or units of Exchange Property in accordance with Section 4, the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash (computed to
 
the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of the VWAP per share of the Common Stock or such other common stock or ADR on the Trading Day immediately preceding (x) the Conversion Date or (y) the date on which such dividend is distributed, as applicable.
     (c) If more than one share of the Series F Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock or other common stock or full ADRs issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series F Preferred Stock so surrendered. If the Corporation pays dividends in Common Stock, other common stock or ADRs on more than one share of the Series F Preferred Stock held at any one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock or other common stock or full ADRs payable in connection with such dividend shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series F Preferred Stock so held.
     (a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
SECTION 11
. Conversion Rate Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates.
     (i) If the Corporation issues Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, or if the Corporation effects a subdivision or combination (including, without limitation, a reverse stock split) of the Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     Any adjustment made under this clause (i) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the
 
open of business on the effective date for such subdivision or combination, as the case may be. If any dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination of the type described in this clause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay or make such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination and (b) the date the dividend or distribution was to be paid or the date the subdivision or combination was to have been effective, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
     (ii) If the Corporation issues to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock any rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to any shareholder rights plan) entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock as of the announcement date for such issuance, each Fixed Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
     Any increase in the Fixed Conversion Rates made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such issuance. To the extent such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or termination, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date of such expiration or termination, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to issue such rights, options
 
or warrants and (b) the date such rights, options or warrants were to have been issued, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such issuance had not occurred.
     For purposes of this clause (ii), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the announcement date for such issuance, and in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Corporation receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.
     (iii) If the Corporation pays a dividend or other distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock of shares of the Corporation's capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation's indebtedness, the Corporation's assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation, excluding:
     (1) any dividend, distribution or issuance as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above;
     (2) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to clause (iv) below; and
     (3) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this clause (iii) apply,
then each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
     If the Board of Directors determines the "FMV" (as defined above) of any dividend or other distribution for purposes of this clause (iii) by referring to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period in computing the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock as of the Record Date for such dividend or other distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of Series F Preferred Stock shall receive, in respect of each share thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of Common Stock receive the shares of the Corporation's capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation's indebtedness, the Corporation's assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or other distribution.
0
     Any increase made under the portion of this clause (iii) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such dividend or other distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay the dividend or other distribution and (b) the date such dividend or distribution was to have been paid, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the dividend or other distribution had not been declared.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation (a "") that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a U.S. national securities exchange, then each Fixed Conversion Rate shall instead be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
     The adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate under the immediately preceding paragraph shall occur at the close of business on the 10th consecutive Trading Day immediately following, and including, the date on which "ex-dividend trading" commences for such dividend or distribution on the relevant exchange, but will be given effect as of the open of business on the date immediately succeeding the Record Date for such dividend or distribution on the relevant exchange. The Corporation shall delay the settlement of any conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock if the Conversion Date occurs after the Record Date for such dividend or distribution and prior to the end of such 10 consecutive Trading Day period. In such event, the Corporation shall deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of such conversion (based on the adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates) on the first Business Day immediately following the last Trading Day of such 10 consecutive Trading Day period.
     For purposes of this subsection (iii) (and subject in all respect to subsection (ii)), rights, options or warrants distributed by the Corporation to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Corporation's capital stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this subsection (iii) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this subsection (iii) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be made under this subsection (iii). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the Issue Date, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the existing rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates under this subsection (iii) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or purchase (x) the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Fixed Conversion Rates shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash

distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
     For purposes of subsection (i), subsection (ii) and this subsection (iii), if any dividend or distribution to which this subsection (iii) is applicable includes one or both of:
     (A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which subsection (i) is applicable (the ""); or
Clause A Distribution
     (B) an issuance of rights, options or warrants to which subsection (ii) is applicable (the ""),
Clause B Distribution
then (1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this subsection (iii) is applicable (the "") and any Fixed Conversion Rate adjustment required by this subsection (iii) with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made, and (2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Fixed Conversion Rate adjustment required by subsection (i) and subsection (ii) with respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Corporation (I) the "Record Date" of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to be the Record Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be "outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such Record Date or immediately prior to the open of business on the effective date" within the meaning of subsection (i) or "outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on such Record Date" within the meaning of subsection (ii).
Clause C Distribution
     (iv) If the Corporation pays or makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding (a) any regular quarterly cash dividend on the Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed the Dividend Threshold Amount, (b) any cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in clause (iii) above and (c) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any of the Corporation's Subsidiaries referred to in clause (v) below, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
     The adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this clause (iv) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of Series F Preferred Stock shall receive, in respect of each share thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of the Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the earlier of (a) the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend and (b) the date such dividend was to have been paid, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.

     (v) If the Corporation or one or more of its Subsidiaries purchases Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer and the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Average VWAP per share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ""), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
 
     The adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate under this clause (v) shall occur at the close of business on the 10 consecutive Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date, but will be given effect as of the open of business on the Expiration Date. The Corporation shall delay the settlement of any conversion of Series F Preferred Stock if the Conversion Date occurs during such 10 consecutive Trading Day period. In such event, the Corporation shall deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of such conversion (based on the adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates) on the first Business Day immediately following the last Trading Day of such 10 consecutive Trading Day period.
th
     (vi) If the Corporation has in effect a shareholder rights plan while any shares of Series F Preferred Stock remain outstanding, Holders of Series F Preferred Stock shall receive, upon a conversion of Series F Preferred Stock, in addition to Common Stock, rights under the Corporation's shareholder rights agreement unless, prior to such conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the Common Stock. If the rights provided for in the shareholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholder rights agreement so that Holders of Series F Preferred Stock would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of the Common Stock, if any, that the Corporation is required to deliver upon conversion of Series F Preferred Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, capital stock (other than Common Stock), evidences of the Corporation's indebtedness, the Corporation's assets or rights to acquire the capital stock, indebtedness or assets of the Corporation pursuant to clause (iii) above, subject to readjustment upon the subsequent expiration, termination or redemption of the rights. A distribution of rights pursuant to a shareholder rights plan will not trigger an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) above.
     (b) . The Corporation may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 11, if the Board
Adjustment for Tax Reasons
 
of Directors deems it advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of the Corporation's shares (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons; that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate. If any adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rate is treated as a distribution to any non-U.S. Holder which is subject to withholding tax, the Corporation (or Transfer Agent or any paying agent on behalf of the Corporation) may set off any withholding tax that is required to be collected with respect to such deemed distribution against cash payments and other distributions otherwise deliverable to such Holder.

Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price, Initial Price, Applicable Market Value and Five-Day Average VWAP.
     (i) No adjustment in any Fixed Conversion Rate will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Fixed Conversion Rate. If the adjustment is not made because the adjustment does not change the Fixed Conversion Rate by at least 1%, then the adjustment that is not made will be carried forward and taken into account in any future adjustment. All required calculations will be made to the nearest cent or 1/10,000th of a share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all adjustments not previously made shall be made upon any Mandatory Conversion, Optional Conversion or Fundamental Change Conversion. If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this Section 11, an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made to the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of Conversion Rate shall apply on the Conversion Date. Such adjustment shall be made by dividing each of the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be either Fixed Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 11(a) or Section 11(b) and the denominator of which shall be such Fixed Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment.

     (ii) No adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates need be made if Holders participate in the transaction that would otherwise require an adjustment (other than in the case of a share split or share combination), at the same time, upon the same terms and otherwise on the same basis as holders of the Common Stock and solely as a result of holding Series F Preferred Stock, as if such Holders held a number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the Maximum Conversion Rate as of the Record Date for such transaction, the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock held by such Holders.

     (F) as a result of a tender offer solely to holders of fewer than 100 shares of the Common Stock.
     (iv) The Corporation shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity and its action in so doing, as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors, shall be final and conclusive unless clearly inconsistent with the intent hereof.
     (d) . Whenever a Fixed Conversion Rate or the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, is to be adjusted, the Corporation shall: (i) compute such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; (ii) as soon as practicable following the determination of a revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holders of the Series F Preferred Stock of the occurrence of such event and (iii) as soon as practicable following the determination of a revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, provide, or cause to be provided, to the Holders of the Series F Preferred Stock a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate or the Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable, was determined and setting forth such revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as applicable.

If a Conversion Date follows a Reorganization Event, the Conversion Rate then in effect shall be applied on the Conversion Date to the amount of such Exchange Property received per share of the Common Stock in the Reorganization Event (a ""), as determined in accordance with this Section 11(e). For the purpose of determining which clause of the definition of Conversion Rate shall apply on any such Conversion Date and for the purpose of calculating the Conversion Rate if clause (ii) of the definition thereof is applicable, the value of a unit of Exchange Property shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, except that if a unit of Exchange Property includes common stock or American Depositary Receipts ("") that are traded on a U.S. national securities exchange, the value of such common stock or ADRs shall be the Applicable Market Value determined with regard to a share of such common stock or a single ADR, as the case may be, .

This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000.
     All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Indenture.
     The Company shall have the right, at its option, to redeem this Security, at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, in multiples of $1,000, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
     1. 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed; or
     2. the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities of this series to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points.
     In each case, the Company shall pay accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time.
 
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P.

     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
     Notice of redemption shall be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities of this series to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for such Securities shall state, among other things, the amount of Securities of this series to be redeemed (any unredeemed portion of such Securities to be in a minimum denomination of $2,000), the Redemption Date, the manner in which the redemption price shall be calculated and the place or places that payment shall be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price together with accrued interest, interest will cease to accrue on any Securities of this series that have been called for redemption on the Redemption Date. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for such calculation.
     In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
     Installments of accrued and unpaid interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of the Securities of this series, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms.

     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

The Depositary shall be deemed to have no knowledge of the Conversion Number unless and until it shall have actually received written notice thereof from the Company, and shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire as to whether any Conversion Number contained in any such written notice is accurate, or whether it complies with the Certificate of Designations. If specified by the holder in such notice of conversion that shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of the Depositary Shares shall be issued to a Person other than the holder surrendering the Receipt for the Depositary Shares being converted,

     Upon fulfillment of the requirements in the foregoing paragraph, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of (i) the Conversion Number (as specified in writing by the Company), (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock or units of Exchange Property to be delivered upon conversion of such Conversion Number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock (each as specified in writing by the Company), (iii) the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock or other securities otherwise issuable and (iv) the amount of cash or other property (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends payable by the Company upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Depositary) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) surrender to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company for conversion in accordance with the Certificate of Designations (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, together with delivery to the Company or the appropriate agent of the Company (pursuant to written instructions from the Company) any other information or payment required by the Certificate of Designations (as specified in writing by the Company) for such conversion, and such certificates shall thereupon be canceled by the Transfer Agent or other authorized agent. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire as to whether the Company provided it with the correct number of shares of Common Stock or units of Exchange Property to be delivered upon any conversion, or the correct amount of funds, cash or other property to be delivered in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock or other securities otherwise issuable or in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends payable by the Company upon any conversion, and the Depositary may rely conclusively on any such information provided by the Company
     As promptly as practicable after the Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Depositary, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock or securities included in the Exchange Property, as the case may be, to be delivered upon conversion of the Conversion Number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and to be delivered in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends payable by the Company upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, if any, (ii) such amount of immediately available funds, if any, to be delivered in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends payable by the Company upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, and (iii) such
 
amount of immediately available funds, if any, to be delivered in lieu of receiving fractional shares and any other property included in the Exchange Property, in each case as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt has been converted and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock or securities included in the Exchange Property, as the case may be, payable by the Company upon such conversion on account of accrued and unpaid dividends pursuant to the Certificate of Designations to the extent (if any) that the Company has elected to pay such accrued and unpaid dividends in shares of Common Stock, in each case as specified in writing by the Company and which has been provided by the Company, (ii) any other property included in the Exchange Property (as specified in writing by the Company and which has been provided by the Company) and (iii) an amount of cash equal to the sum of (x) the amount of cash payable by the Company upon such conversion on account of accrued and unpaid dividends pursuant to the Certificate of Designations to the extent (if any) that the Company has elected to pay such dividends in cash and (y) the amount of cash payable by the Company in lieu of delivering fractional shares of Common Stock or other securities pursuant to Section 10 of the Certificate of Designations, in each case as specified in writing by the Company and which has been provided by the Company.
     If the holder surrenders a Receipt in connection with a conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6 of the Certificate of Designations and the applicable Conversion Date occurs during the period from the close of business on a Regular Record Date for any declared dividend to the open of business on the immediately following Dividend Payment Date, such holder shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipt an amount of funds equal to the dividend for the then-current Dividend Period with respect to such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designations, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on a Regular Record Date and the open of business on the immediately following Dividend Payment Date, or whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the related Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such amount was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designations.
     In the event that a holder of a surrendered Receipt elects to convert less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt under this Section 2.10, upon such conversion, the Depositary shall, if requested in writing and provided with all necessary information and documents, authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of shares of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate, which, if required by the Depositary,
 
shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.11 Fractional Shares
.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock or any other security will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion or as a result of any distribution pursuant to Section 4.02. If more than one share of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by Receipts held by the same holder shall be surrendered for conversion or entitled to a distribution pursuant to Section 4.02 at one time, the number of full shares of Common Stock or other security issuable upon conversion thereof or upon the relevant distribution, as applicable, shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock so surrendered or entitled to such distribution. Whenever a payment in lieu of fractional shares is to be made by the Depositary, the Company shall (i) promptly prepare and deliver to the Depositary a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the facts related to such payments and the prices and/or formulas utilized in calculating such payments, and (ii) provide sufficient cash to the Depositary in the form of fully collected funds to make such payments. The Depositary shall be fully protected in relying upon such a certificate and shall have no duty with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of, any payment in lieu of fractional shares under any Section of this Deposit Agreement relating to the payment of fractional shares unless and until the Depositary shall have received such a certificate and sufficient cash. If the amount of cash required to be distributed by the Depositary in lieu of fractional shares exceeds the amount of cash received by the Depositary in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Certificate of Designations, then the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or any other entity as so instructed in writing by the Company, on behalf of all holders of Receipts entitled to fractional shares shall, as soon as practicable after the distribution date, sell the minimum number of such shares on the open market such that each such record holder will be entitled to receive, in lieu of a fractional share, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to such record holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from such sale. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of any holder in connection with such a conversion are correct.
     SECTION 2.12 No Pre-Release
.
     The Depositary shall not deliver any deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts prior to the receipt and cancellation of such Receipts or other similar method used with respect to Receipts held by DTC. The Depositary shall not issue any Receipts prior to the receipt by the Depositary of the Convertible Preferred Stock corresponding to Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipts. At no time will any Receipts be outstanding if such Receipts do not evidence Depositary Shares representing Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary, subject to the rights of holders to
 
receive distributions upon conversion of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4.01 or 4.02.
     SECTION 3.01 Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
     Any Person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary. The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.
     SECTION 3.02 Payment of Fees and Expenses.
     Holders of Receipts shall be obligated upon any transfer of Receipts or withdrawal of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock to provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that any applicable taxes or other charges not payable by the Company pursuant to Section 3.05 have been paid. Until such payment is made, transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of the Convertible Preferred Stock or money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused, any dividend or other distribution may be withheld, and any part or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder a reasonable number of days prior to such sale). Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such taxes or other charges, the holders remaining liable for any deficiency.
     SECTION 3.03 Representations and Warranties as to Convertible Preferred Stock.
     In the case of the initial deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Convertible Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
     SECTION 3.04 Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares.
     The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/40 fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred
th
 
Stock. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
     SECTION 3.05 Taxes

     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes and charges that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax or charge that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any Person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the Person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or charge or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company and the Depositary , that such tax or charge has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 3.06 Listing
.
     The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it will apply to list the Depositary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, upon such listing, the Company hereby covenants and agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to keep the Depositary Shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
     SECTION 4.01 Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive (i) any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock (other than any cash distribution in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends on account of any conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5, 6 or 7 of the Certificate of Designations), (as specified in writing by the Company) the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute on the date it receives such dividend or distribution or as soon as practicable thereafter to record holders of Receipts as of the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such dividend or distribution as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders or (ii) any cash distribution in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends on account any conversion of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5, 6 or 7 of the Certificate of Designations, (as specified in writing by the Company), the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute on the date that it receives such distribution or as soon as practicable thereafter to holders of Receipts as of the applicable Conversion Date such amounts of such cash distribution as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares entitled to receive such distribution evidenced by the
 
Receipts held by such holders; , , in either case, that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.

     SECTION 4.02 Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock (other than any such distribution in connection with any conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5, 6 or 7 of the Certificate of Designations, as specified in writing by the Company, including on account of accrued and unpaid dividends), the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute on the date it receives such distribution or as soon as practicable thereafter to record holders of Receipts as of the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered. The Company covenants for the benefit of the holders of Depositary Shares that it will use its best efforts to provide such an opinion of counsel to the Depositary with regard to any securities that it delivers to the Depositary in respect of any conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5, 6 or 7 of the Certificate of Designations prior to the date of such delivery. Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock in connection with any conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5, 6 or 7 of the Certificate of Designations (as specified in writing by the Company), including on account of accrued and unpaid dividends, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute on the date it receives such distribution or as soon as practicable thereafter, to record holders of Receipts as of the applicable Conversion Date such amounts of the securities or
 
property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares entitled to receive such distribution evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Person or Persons entitled to receive any Common Stock issuable upon any conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on the applicable Conversion Date.
     Delivery of shares of Common Stock and other property pursuant to this Section 4.02 may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate, which, if required by the Depositary, shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 4.03 Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the Persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered and that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The Company covenants that it will not offer or cause to be offered any such rights, preferences or privileges unless it is able to provide such an opinion of counsel; that this provision is solely for the benefit of the holders and does not constitute a waiver of any rights that the holders may have under the Certificate of Incorporation, applicable law or otherwise. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
provided
 
     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.

     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, or to vote at such meeting.
     SECTION 4.05 Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt from the Company of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, if requested in writing and provided with all necessary information and documents, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the
 
Company and which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the holders of Receipts on such record date, (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock), the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by all Receipts as to which any particular voting instructions are received. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted in accordance with the instructions received by the Depositary. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will not vote the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock that are represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
     SECTION 4.06 Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the conversion rate of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designations to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) subject to the last sentence of this Section 4.06, treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Common Stock or other Exchange Property issuable upon conversion of the
 
Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5, 6 or 7 of the Certification of Designations (or their successors) shall not be treated as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement and instead the provisions in Section 2.10 and Section 4.02 shall apply.

     SECTION 4.09 Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

     SECTION 5.03 Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents and the Registrar.
     Neither the Depositary nor any of the Depositary's Agents nor the Transfer Agent or the Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other Person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any of the Depositary's Agents nor the Transfer Agent or the Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary losses or damages, of any kind whatsoever, to any Person, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such Person alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages or been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. Any liability of the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar under this Deposit Agreement shall be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to such Person.
     None of the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
     None of the Depositary, any of Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any Person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and the Registrar and the Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
 
forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Deposit Agreement against the Depositary or the Registrar or the Transfer Agent.
     The Depositary, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent may own, buy, sell or deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company or its affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to or otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent hereunder. The Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any of the Depositary's Agents shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any of the Depositary's Agents are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
provided
however
     Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates) nor any of the Depositary's Agents makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities Act, the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares, the Receipts (except its countersignature thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made therein or herein; , , that the Depositary is responsible for its representations in this Deposit Agreement.
provided
however
     The Company agrees that it has registered the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and the Depositary Shares in accordance with the applicable securities laws.
     In the event the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by it pursuant to this Deposit Agreement, such Person shall promptly notify the Company of the details of such alleged ambiguity or uncertainty, and may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action, and such Person shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability to any Person from refraining from or for taking such action, absent bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), unless and until (i) the rights of all parties have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction or (ii) such Person receives written instructions with respect to such matter signed by the Company that eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of such Person.
 
     Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar and the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
     Neither the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Transfer Agent nor the Registrar will be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, Convertible Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment to the Certificate of Designations shall affect the rights, duties, obligations or immunities of the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar hereunder.
     The Depositary, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar hereunder:
          (i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;

          (iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder; if, however, the Depositary, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar determines to take any legal or other action hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in such Person's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, it shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
          (iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or omitting to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, facsimile transmission or other
 
document or security delivered to it and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;
          (v) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or omitting to act upon the written, telephonic, electronic and oral instructions, with respect to any matter relating to the Depositary's, the Transfer Agent's or the Registrar's actions as depositary, transfer agent or registrar covered by this Deposit Agreement (or supplementing or qualifying any such actions), of officers of the Company;
          (vi) may consult counsel satisfactory to it (who may be an employee of the Depositary, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar), and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it hereunder in accordance with the advice of such counsel;
          (vii) shall not be called upon at any time to advise any Person with respect to the Depositary Shares or Receipts;
          (viii) shall not be liable or responsible for any recital or statement contained in any documents relating hereto or the Depositary Shares or Receipts; and
          (ix) shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties (other than with respect to its own) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Deposit Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Deposit Agreement.

Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts.

Every successor depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all rights, title and interest in the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts.
