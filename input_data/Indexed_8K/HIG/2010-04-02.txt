Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 1, 2010, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Company") announced the following during the Company's investor meeting in New York City: For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, the Company expects to incur a charge of approximately $20 million related to a decrease in deferred tax assets as a result of recent federal legislation that will reduce the tax deduction available to the Company related to retiree health care costs beginning in 2013. Also during the first quarter of 2010, the Company increased its exposure to investment-grade corporate securities from (on a fair value basis) approximately $33 billion as of December 31, 2009 to approximately $35 billion as of February 28, 2010, out of a total fair value of $37 billion in investments in corporate securities at that date. The Company continues to take targeted portfolio actions to reduce the risk of future losses within the investment portfolio. Actions taken in 2010 (through February 28) to reduce risk in the investm ent portfolio included sales of approximately $700 million of commercial real estate-related investments. The net unrealized losses associated with real estate related assets declined from approximately $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2009 to approximately $3.3 billion as of February 28, 2010, largely the result of improved market pricing and to a lesser extent interest rate declines. The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
