(the "Company") approved the grant of a restricted stock unit award to Liam E. McGee, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, with a grant date value of $2 million. On July 21, 2010, the Compensation and Personnel Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board approved the grant of restricted stock unit awards to named executive officers Christopher J. Swift, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Lizabeth H. Zlatkus, Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer. Mr. Swifts restricted stock unit award has a grant date value of $500,000 and Ms. Zlatkuss restricted stock unit award has a grant date value of $900,000. These awards will be granted on the first day of the Companys open trading window following the filing of the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, currently anticipated to be August 6, 2010. The awards, which will be granted under the Companys 2010 Incentive Stock Plan (the "Plan"), will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and be payable in shares of the Companys common stock. Under the Plan, restricted stock awards made to retirement-eligible employees of the Company will vest pro rata upon retirement. Ms. Zlatkus is a retirement-eligible employee under the Plan. The Compensation Committee also approved a payment to named executive officer Gregory McGreevey, the Companys Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and President of Hartford Investment Management Company, in an amount not to exceed $200,000 to cover loss Mr. McGreevey will incur in connection with the sale of his current home in the Atlanta, Georgia area (the "Relocation Amount"). Payment of the Relocation Amount is contingent upon (i) consummation of the sale on or before October 19, 2010 and (ii) Mr. McGreevey's agreement to repay the Re location Amount if, prior to the date that is one year following the date of sale (a) Mr. McGreevey voluntarily terminates his employment or (b) the Company terminates Mr. McGreevey's employment for certain actions, including actions that would violate the Companys Code of Conduct or otherwise violate the Companys ethical standards.
