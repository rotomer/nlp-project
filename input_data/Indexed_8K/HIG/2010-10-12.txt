Ms. Mikells was appointed to serve on the following committees of the Board: Legal and Public Affairs Committee; Compensation and Personnel Committee; and Finance, Investment and Risk Management Committee ("FIRMCo"). Ms. Mikells does not have a direct or indirect interest in any transaction with the Company that would qualify as a related party transaction under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Ms. Mikells will receive, as part of her compensation, $2,500 for each Board meeting attended and, with the exception of FIRMCo, $2,000 for each committee meeting attended. She will also receive a prorated portion of the 2010-2011 compensation package for non-employee directors for the 2010-2011 Board service year, including a prorated annual cash retainer of $38,000, payable immediately, and a prorated restricted stock award valued at $87,500 that will be granted on the second trading day following the filing of the Companys Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2010, based on the Company's closing stock price on the grant date. The award will fully vest on the last day of the 2010-2011 Board service year.
