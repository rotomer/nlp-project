As described under Item 1.01 above, pursuant to the Notes Underwriting Agreement and Notes Pricing Agreement, the Company issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes, $800 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes and $425 million aggregate principal amount of 2042 Notes pursuant to a senior indenture, dated as of April 11, 2007, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (the "Senior Notes Trustee") (the "Senior Notes Indenture").
The Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and will rank equally with all unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes will bear interest at per-annum rates of 4.000% in the case of the 2017 Notes, 5.125% in the case of the 2022 Notes and 6.625% in the case of the 2042 Notes. The Company will pay interest on each series of Notes semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2012.
The Senior Notes Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to sell, transfer or create certain liens, including liens on the capital stock of any restricted subsidiary.
The 2017 Notes will mature on October 15, 2017, the 2022 Notes will mature on April 15, 2022 and the 2042 Notes will mature on April 15, 2042. However, the Company, at its option, may redeem the Notes at any time in whole or from time to time in part in multiples of $1,000, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current treasury rate plus 45, 45 or 50 basis points for the 2017 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2042 Notes, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the date of redemption.
The Senior Notes Indenture contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Senior Notes Indenture occurs and is continuing, the Senior Notes Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of the relevant series may declare the principal amount of all the Notes of the relevant series to be immediately due and payable.
The foregoing description of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such documents, which are attached or incorporated by reference hereto as Exhibits 4.1, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 and incorporated herein by reference.
Junior Subordinated Debentures
As described under Item 1.01 above, pursuant to the Debentures Underwriting Agreement and Debentures Pricing Agreement, the Company issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of Debentures pursuant to a junior subordinated indenture, dated as of June 6, 2008, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (the "Debentures Trustee") (the "Junior Subordinated Indenture"), as supplemented by a third supplemental indenture between the Company and the Debentures Trustee, dated as of April 5, 2012 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture" and together with the Junior Subordinated Indenture, the "Debentures Indenture").
The Debentures rank pari passu with the Company's 8.125% Fixed-To-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068 and the Company's 10% Fixed-To-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068 (the "10% Debentures"). The Company has entered into a Warrant and Debenture Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 30, 2012, with Allianz SE to repurchase the 10% Debentures. See our Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 2, 2012. The Debentures initially bear interest at an annual rate of 7.875%, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2012, to and including April 15, 2022. Thereafter, the Debentures bear interest at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 5.596%, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2022. So long as no event of default with respect to the Debentures has occurred and is continuing, the Company has the right, on one or more occasions, to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures as described in the Debentures Indenture for up to ten consecutive years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will accumulate additional interest at an annual rate equal to the annual interest rate then applicable to the Debentures.
The Debentures will mature on April 15, 2042. However, the Company may redeem the Debentures, in whole but not in part, at any time prior to April 15, 2022, within 90 days of the occurrence of a "tax event" or "rating agency event" at a redemption price equal to their principal amount or, if greater, the make-whole redemption amount calculated as described in the Debentures Indenture, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. On or after April 15, 2022, the Company may redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption.
The Debentures Indenture contains customary events of default, subject to the interest deferral provisions. If an event of default under the Debentures Indenture occurs and is continuing, the Debentures Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures may declare the principal amount of all the Debentures to be immediately due and payable.
The foregoing description of the Junior Subordinated Debenture, the Third Supplemental Indenture and the Debentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such documents, which are attached or incorporated by reference hereto as Exhibits 4.2, 4.3 and 4.7 and incorporated herein by reference.

8. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities be, at and as of the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

(d) Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto.
(e) David C. Robinson, Senior Vice President and Director of Corporate Law of the Company, shall have furnished to you his written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex III hereto.
(f) David C. Robinson, Senior Vice President and Director of Corporate Law of the Company, shall have furnished to you a letter, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, to the effect that:
Based upon specified participation of such counsel in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, (a) the Registration Statement (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial data included therein, as to which such counsel expresses no view), at the time it became effective, and the Prospectus (except as aforesaid), as of the date thereof, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; (b) the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which such counsel expresses no view), as of the respective dates of their filing with
 
the Commission, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder; (c) such counsel has no reason to believe that (I) the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which such counsel need express no view), at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (II) as of the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package (except the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which such counsel need express no view) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (III) the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which such counsel need express no view), as of its date and such Time of Delivery, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and (d) no information has come to such counsel's attention that causes such counsel to believe that any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required;

(h) (i) Except as described in or contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has not been any material adverse change in, or any adverse development which materially affects, the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, from the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus there shall not have been (A) any change in the capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities and upon exercises of stock purchases or warrants, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or issued thereafter as compensation consistent with past practice), (B) any change in long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (C) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, in each of clauses (A), (B) or (C) above, otherwise than as described in or contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
(i) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities the effect of which, in any case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in your reasonable judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
 
(j) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange (the ""); (ii) a material suspension or limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) a material adverse change in the financial markets, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis; if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and
Exchange

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (including the Form T-1), the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with
 
investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter of Designated Securities will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to
 
Section 9(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent,
 
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or
 
other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in the Pricing Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated
 
Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to such Pricing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
12. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated due to the failure of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP to deliver its opinion to the Representatives pursuant to Section 8(c) or pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities governed by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than in respect of a breach of the Pricing Agreement by any Underwriter of Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction.

8. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities be, at and as of the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

(f) David C. Robinson, Senior Vice President and Director of Corporate Law of the Company, shall have furnished to you a letter, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, to the effect that:
Based upon specified participation of such counsel in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, (a) the Registration Statement (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial data included therein, as to which such counsel expresses no view), at the time it became effective, and the Prospectus (except as aforesaid), as of the date thereof, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; (b) the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which such counsel expresses no view), as of the respective dates of their filing with the Commission, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder; (c) such counsel has no reason to believe that (I) the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which such counsel need express no view), at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (II) as of the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package (except the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which such counsel need express no view) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (III) the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial data and management's report on the effectiveness of

contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
(i) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities the effect of which, in any case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in your reasonable judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (including the Form T-1), the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter of Designated Securities will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
 
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 9(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
 
received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter
 
within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
    10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in the Pricing Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which such
 
Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to such Pricing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
12. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated due to the failure of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP to deliver its opinion to the Representatives pursuant to Section 8(c) or pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities governed by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein (other than in respect of a breach of the Pricing Agreement by any Underwriter of Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
