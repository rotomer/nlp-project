NEWS RELEASE
The Hartford Announces Second Quarter 2012 Estimate of Catastrophe Losses
Hartford, Conn., July 16, 2012  The Hartford today announced that it expects to report current accident year catastrophe losses of $280 million to $300 million, before tax ($180 million to $195 million, after tax), in the second quarter of 2012, as compared with $447 million, before tax ($290 million, after tax) in the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter 2012 losses resulted from 13 catastrophe events, including several major hailstorms and the June 28 storms that produced widespread losses in the Ohio River Valley and Mid-Atlantic states.
The company also announced its estimate of property and casualty (P&C) prior accident year loss reserve development, including the results of its annual asbestos and environmental (A&E) reserve studies. Second quarter 2012 financial results are expected to include unfavorable P&C prior accident year loss reserve development of approximately $45 million to $55 million, before tax ($30 million to $35 million, after tax). This includes approximately $50 million, before tax ($33 million after tax), for unfavorable A&E loss reserve development as compared with unfavorable asbestos loss reserve development of $290 million, before tax ($189 million, after tax) in the second quarter of 2011. The second quarter 2012 A&E unfavorable loss reserve development is largely due to higher estimates for certain existing asbestos policyholders.
The Hartford will release its second quarter 2012 financial results on Wednesday, Aug. 1, 2012 at approximately 4:15 p.m. EDT and will host a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2012 financial results on Thursday, Aug. 2, 2012, at 9 a.m. EDT. The conference call will be simultaneously webcast on the investor relations section of the company's website at .
