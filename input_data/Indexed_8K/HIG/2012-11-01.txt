The Hartford Reports
Third
Quarter 2012 Financial Results
HARTFORD, Conn.,
Nov 1, 2012
 The Hartford (NYSE:HIG) reported net income of
$401 million
, or
$0.83
per diluted share, for the
third
quarter of
2012
, compared with net income of
$60 million
, or
$0.11
per diluted share, in the
third
quarter of
2011
. The company also reported that
third
quarter
2012
core earnings rose to
$378
million, or $0.78 per diluted share, from $
50
million, or $0.08
per diluted share, in the
third
quarter of
2011
.
The Hartford generated strong third quarter financial results, reflecting continued P&C pricing momentum and low catastrophes," said Chairman, President and CEO Liam E. McGee. "Renewal pricing increased 8% in Standard Commercial, 4% in personal auto and 6% in homeowners, with higher retention in all three lines. Group Benefits long-term disability terminations improved, resulting in a slightly lower loss ratio. Fixed income deposits grew in Mutual Funds, resulting in significantly better net flows."
The Hartford achieved several strategic objectives this quarter, including the successful completion of sales agreements, ahead of schedule, for Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial Services, added McGee. These transactions, which are expected to generate an approximately $2.2 billion statutory capital benefit, are a significant step forward in The Hartford's progress towards sharpening our focus on our P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses."

in the
third
quarter of
2012
, an
84%
increase
from
$87 million
in the
third
quarter of
2011
primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development,
improved
to
97.5%
in the
third
quarter of
2012
compared with
99.4%
in the
third
quarter of
2011
.The third quarter 2012 combined ratio included $39 million, or 2.5 points, of unfavorable current accident year loss reserve development, before tax, related to the first half of the year, principally for workers' compensation and commercial auto. The third quarter 2011 combined ratio included $47 million, or 3.0 points, of unfavorable current accident year loss reserve development, before tax, related to the first half of 2011, principally for workers' compensation.

8%
, a 1 point increase over the second quarter of 2012. Middle Market pricing increased 11%, while Middle
3

third
quarter of
2012
compared with
favorable
development of
$6 million
, after tax, in the
third

quarter of
2012
were
$23 million
,
up
15%

. The loss ratio
improved
slightly to
79.3%
compared with
80.1%
in the
third
quarter of
2011
. Group Benefits loss experience reflects incidence that is stable but elevated when compared to historical levels, higher severity and a continuation of the slightly improving termination trends in group long term disability that emerged in mid-2012. Group life claims experience deteriorated modestly in the quarter as compared with favorable experience in the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011.
Third
quarter
2012
fully insured premium in Group Benefits
declined
7%
to
$926 million

CONSUMER MARKETS
Third
Quarter
2012
Highlights:
[1] Excludes catastrophes and prior year development*
Consumer Markets had net income of
$94 million
for the third quarter of 2012 compared with a net loss of
$16 million
in the third quarter of 2011, due principally to significantly lower catastrophe losses and favorable prior year loss reserve development. Core earnings were
$93 million
in the third quarter of 2012 compared with core losses of
$10 million
in the third quarter of 2011.
Third quarter 2012 net income and core earnings included no net current accident year catastrophe losses, as $16 million, after tax, of catastrophe losses from events occurring in the third quarter of 2012 were offset by $16 million, after tax, of favorable development on prior quarter 2012 accident year catastrophes. Third quarter 2011 catastrophe losses totaled $73 million. Favorable prior year development totaled $32 million, after tax, in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $6 million, after tax, in the third quarter of 2011.
4
Consumer Markets combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, was
93.3%
in the third quarter of 2012, down from
95.5%
in the third quarter of 2011. The improvement reflects an almost 7 point improvement in the homeowners' combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, due primarily to earned pricing increases, lower frequency of non-catastrophe weather claims and lower severity. This experience was partially offset by higher auto physical damage severity, consistent with trends earlier in 2012.
Third quarter 2012 written premiums were flat compared with the third quarter of 2011, while earned premiums declined
2%
to
$912 million
. New business written rose 9% to $116 million due to strong production in AARP Agency. Auto new business premiums rose 5% while homeowners increased 23%. Third quarter 2012 policy count retention for auto and homeowners increased 2 and 3 points to 85% and 87%, respectively, from the third quarter of 2011.
WEALTH MANAGEMENT
Third
Quarter 2012 Highlights:
Wealth Management net income was
$22 million
in the
third
quarter of 2012 compared with a net loss of
$8 million
in the
third
quarter of 2011. Net income for the period included a DAC unlock charge of $14 million, after tax, for market performance and assumptions changes as compared with a charge of $85 million, after tax, in the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter 2012 core and net income for Wealth Management included
$19
million, after tax, of restructuring and other expenses.
Core earnings, excluding DAC unlock and restructuring and other expenses, were $63 million, in the third quarter of 2012, slightly below
third
quarter 2011 core earnings of
$65 million
due to higher benefits in Individual Life and lower core earnings in Mutual Funds compared with the prior year.
The DAC unlock charge included in core earnings was
$12 million
, after tax, in the third quarter of 2012 compared with
$81 million
, after tax, in the
third
quarter of 2011.
Mutual Funds
third
quarter 2012 core earnings were
$18 million
, down
25%
compared with
$24 million
in the
third
quarter of 2011. The reduction in core earnings was principally due to higher distribution and marketing expenses and lower fees as a result of lower average assets under
5
management compared to the third quarter of 2011.
Individual Life
third
quarter 2012 core earnings, excluding DAC unlock, were
$21 million
compared with
$37 million
in the
third
quarter of 2011. Core earnings decreased from the
third
quarter of 2011 principally due to
$12 million
, after tax, of restructuring and other costs as well as higher life insurance benefits compared to the
third
quarter of 2011.
Retirement Plans
third
quarter 2012 core earnings, excluding DAC unlock, totaled
$5 million
compared with
$4 million
in the
third
quarter of 2011. Core earnings in the
third
quarter of 2012 included a $7 million, after tax, charge for restructuring and other expenses.
RUNOFF OPERATIONS
                                            
Runoff Operations
third
quarter 2012 net income was
$169 million
compared with net income of
$113 million
in the
third
quarter of 2011. Net income includes net realized capital gains, after tax and after DAC, of
$12 million
in the
third
quarter of 2012 compared with
$61 million
in the
third
quarter of 2011. Runoff Operations
third
quarter 2012 core earnings, excluding DAC unlock, were
$168 million
compared with core earnings, excluding DAC unlock, of
$178 million
in the
third
quarter of 2011.
Runoff Operations net income for the third quarter of 2012 included a DAC unlock charge for market performance and assumption changes in the Life Other Operations segment of $65 million, after tax, compared with a charge of $384 million, after tax, in the third quarter of 2011. The DAC unlock charge for market and assumption changes included in core earnings was
$11 million
, after tax,
in the third quarter of 2012 as compared with a
DAC unlock charge
$126 million
, after tax, in the
third
quarter of 2011.
Life Other Operations core earnings, excluding DAC unlock, in the third quarter of 2012 declined
13%
to
$147 million
from
$169 million
in the
third
quarter of 2011 due to U.S. variable annuity
6
outflows and lower alternative investment yields. Account values for the Life Other Operations segment totaled $167.0 billion at September 30, 2012, down 1% from $168.9 billion at September 30, 2011, reflecting a decrease in account values due to $10.2 billion of surrenders over the past twelve months in the U.S. variable annuity block, largely offset by the impact of higher capital market levels.
For the third quarter of 2012, net realized gains from hedging were $77 million. Gains in the U.S. Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) program, which benefited from a reduction in the GMWB liability due to changes in assumptions for lower than anticipated benefit utilization by policyholders, were partially offset by losses on the international program due to increases in capital markets.
Core earnings for P&C Other Operations in the
third
quarter of 2012 totaled
$21 million
compared with core earnings of
$9 million
in the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter 2012 results included
unfavorable
prior year loss reserve development of approximately $1 million, after tax, while third quarter of 2011 included unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $14 million, including environmental loss reserve development of $12 million, after tax. The company completed its comprehensive annual environmental loss reserve study in the second quarter of 2012, in addition to its annual asbestos loss reserve study.

net loss
of
$78 million
in the
third
quarter of
2012
compared with a

of
$107 million
in the
third
quarter of
2011
. Corporate

$87 million
in the
third
quarter of
2012

due to higher expenses, including restructuring and other costs that were not fully offset by a reduction in interest expenses compared with the third quarter of 2011.
INVESTMENTS

Quarter
2012
Highlights:

[1] Yields calculated using annualized net investment income (excluding income related to equity securities, trading) divided by the monthly average invested assets at cost, amortized cost, or adjusted carrying value, as applicable, excluding equity securities, trading, and consolidated variable interest entity non-controlling interests.
Net investment income, excluding trading securities, declined 3% to $1.03 billion, before tax, in the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011 due to lower returns on limited partnerships and other alternative investments. Annualized investment yield, before tax, was 4.2% in the third quarter of 2012 compared with 4.3% in the third quarter of 2011 due to lower returns on limited partnerships and other alternative investments. Annualized returns on limited partnerships and other alternative investments were approximately 4% in the third quarter of 2012 approximately $10 million below the annualized 9% budgeted yield assumption, compared with 13% in the third quarter of 2011.
Annualized investment yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, was up slightly to 4.2% compared to 4.1% in the third quarter of 2011 resulting from modest duration extension of the portfolio and a slight increase in higher yielding asset classes in the company's general account.
Net impairment losses and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve in the quarter were $37 million, before tax ($24 million, after tax and DAC) compared with losses of $60 million ($34 million, after tax and DAC) in the third quarter of 2011.

DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Hartford uses non-GAAP financial measures in this press release to assist investors in analyzing the company's operating performance for the periods presented herein. Because The Hartford's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing The Hartford's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. Definitions and calculations of other financial measures used in this press release can be found below and in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for the
third
quarter of 2012, which is available on The Hartford's website,
http://ir.thehartford.com
.
Book value per diluted common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI):
Book value per diluted common share excluding AOCI is a non-GAAP financial measure based on a GAAP financial measure. It is calculated by dividing (a) common stockholders' equity excluding AOCI, net of tax, by (b) diluted common shares outstanding. The Hartford provides book value per diluted common share excluding AOCI to enable investors to analyze the companys stockholders equity excluding the effect of changes in the value of the companys investment portfolio and other assets due to interest rates, currency and other factors. The Hartford believes book value per diluted common share excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in market value. Stockholders equity per diluted common share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of stockholders equity per diluted common share to book value per diluted common share excluding AOCI as of
September 30, 2012
and
September 30, 2011
, is set forth below.
Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development
: Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development is a non-GAAP financial measure. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. This ratio measures the cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates a positive underwriting result. A combined ratio above 100% indicates a negative underwriting result*. The combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development represents the combined ratio for the current accident year, excluding the impact of catastrophes and prior year development. The company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss development. A reconciliation of the combined ratio to the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development is provided in the table below.
13
Core Earnings
: The Hartford uses the non-GAAP financial measure core earnings as a measure of the company's operating performance. The Hartford believes that the measure core earnings provides investors with a measure of the performance of the company's ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in the company's insurance and financial services businesses before the net effect of certain realized capital gains and losses, discontinued operations and loss from the extinguishment of debt. Some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting activities of the company's business.
  
Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses (net of tax and the effects of deferred policy acquisition costs) that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to the company's insurance operations, so core earnings includes certain net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives and net periodic settlements on the Japan fixed annuity cross currency swap. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the statement of operations such as net investment income (loss). Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the company's business. Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate both net income and core earnings when reviewing the company's performance. A reconciliation of core earnings to net income as of
September 30, 2012
and
September 30, 2011
, is included in this press release. A reconciliation of core earnings to net income for individual reporting segments can be found in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for the
third
quarter of
2012
.
Core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share
: Core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share is calculated based on the non-GAAP financial measure core earnings. The Hartford believes that the measure core earnings per diluted common share provides investors with a valuable measure of the company's operating performance for many of the same reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core earnings. Net income per diluted common share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share should not be considered as a substitute for net income per diluted common share and does not reflect the overall profitability of the company's business.
14
Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate both net income per diluted common share and core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share when reviewing the company's performance. A reconciliation of core earnings available to common shareholders per diluted share to net income per diluted common share as of
September 30, 2012
and
September 30, 2011
is included in this press release under the heading The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Results By Segment.
Underwriting results
: The Hartford's management evaluates profitability of the P&C Commercial and Consumer Markets segments primarily on the basis of underwriting results. Underwriting results is a before-tax measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting results are influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of The Hartford's pricing. Underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by The Hartford's underwriting discipline, as management strives to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, effective management of claims, use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses. The Hartford believes that the measure underwriting results provides investors with a valuable measure of before-tax profitability derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the company's investing activities. A reconciliation of underwriting results to net income as of
September 30, 2012
, and
September 30, 2011
, is set forth below.
