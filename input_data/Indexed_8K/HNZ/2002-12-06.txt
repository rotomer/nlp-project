Exhibit 99 HEINZ/DEL MONTE TRANSACTION CONTINUES TO PROCEED ON SCHEDULE AS HEINZ ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS FOR BUSINESSES BEING SPUN OFF PITTSBURGH, December 5, 2002 -- In connection with its previously announced transaction with Del Monte, H. J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today announced second quarter Fiscal 2003 operating highlights (three months ending October 30, 2002) for the businesses designated to be spun off to its shareholders and then merged with Del Monte Corporation, a subsidiary of Del Monte Foods Company (NYSE: DLM). These businesses include Heinz's U.S. and Canadian pet food, U.S. tuna and retail private label soup, and U.S. infant feeding. (Heinz will release its full second quarter results on December 12, 2002.) Overall, second quarter Fiscal 2003 operating income for these businesses, before corporate charges, is 12.1% higher than that of the prior-year period, on slightly lower sales (-1.5%). Heinz also said depreciation and amortization for the second quarter for these businesses is consistent with the first quarter of Fiscal 2003. PET PRODUCTS Second quarter sales for U.S. and Canadian pet products are $227.5 million, a 4.8% decline from the prior year, principally due to the planned exit from certain private label items. Operating income for pet products is $46.0 million for the quarter, up 25.5% versus the prior-year period, reflecting margin growth due to pricing and improved mix. TUNA Tuna sales are $154.7 million, up 5.3% versus the year-ago period, with operating income for the quarter increasing to $15.1 million, or 89.4% higher than the prior year. These results reflect volume and share growth, led by a shift toward pouch tuna, along with a beneficial change in fish costs. SOUP AND INFANT FEEDING Second quarter sales for soup and infant feeding are $89.5 million, a 3.9% decrease from the prior-year period, principally as a result of lower infant feeding volumes and market share. Operating income for soup and infant feeding is $18.6 million for the period, a 29.5% decline from the prior year. HEINZ PROSPECTIVE SPUN-OFF BUSINESSES OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS FOR THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 30, 2002 AND OCTOBER 31, 2001 (IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS) - --------------- (a) Carve-out financial statements for these businesses will reflect corporate charges consistent with the prior-year period. Heinz noted that its current results are consistent with the company's November 20 announcement that the businesses to be spun off were expected to achieve operating income, before corporate charges, of $76-80 million, an amount greater than that recorded by these businesses for the same period in the prior fiscal year and more than 50% higher than the $49.7 million for the first quarter of Fiscal 2003.
The Heinz/Del Monte transaction is proceeding on schedule toward closing by the end of calendar 2002 or early 2003, with a Del Monte stockholder meeting scheduled for December 19, 2002, regulatory review completed, physical separation of the businesses achieved and financing activities underway.
