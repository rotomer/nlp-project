ITEM 12. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION H. J. Heinz Company wishes to disclose its press release dated June 12, 2003 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99. The attached press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments, and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant.

Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today announced results for the fourth quarter ended April 30, 2003. Excluding special items in both periods, Heinz reported diluted earnings per share of $0.52 from continuing operations. The results were consistent with the year-earlier quarter and with the company's previous outlook for Fiscal 2003. Fourth-quarter sales from continuing operations rose 6% to $2.19 billion from $2.07 billion, as sales in Europe and Asia/Pacific increased due primarily to favorable foreign exchange and positive net price. The strong performance in those international markets and price increases in North America offset lower volume in some U.S. frozen food brands. Including special items, Heinz reported fourth-quarter net income of $102.6 million, or $0.29 per diluted share versus $223.5 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the year-earlier period. The year-ago results include earnings of $43.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share from
discontinued operations that were spun off to Heinz shareholders and then merged with Del Monte Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Del Monte Foods Company, in a transaction that was completed December 20, 2002. The discontinued operations were U.S. and Canadian pet food, and U.S. operations in seafood, retail private label soup, "College Inn" broth and infant feeding. Commenting on the company's performance, H.J. Heinz Company Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "Heinz earnings for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year were on target with our forecast range, notwithstanding the downturn in the global economy. Heinz has become a stronger global food company with the successful spin-off to Del Monte and ongoing initiatives designed to restore profitable growth, accelerate the momentum of our big brands, improve efficiency, reduce our cash conversion cycle and drive down costs. We reduced our net debt by $1.3 billion and generated operating free cash flow of $752 million (operating cash flow less capital spending) despite a $224 million contribution to various Heinz pension plans. We are now a more focused company with a global portfolio of number-one brands. Importantly, we are also off to a good start in our new FY04." Excluding special items, fourth-quarter operating income from continuing operations increased to $342.2 million from $341.5 million in the previous year, reflecting significant increases in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments, primarily due to favorable pricing, foreign exchange, and favorable sales mix. Operating income was unfavorably impacted in the Heinz North America segment by increased marketing and selling & distribution expense and by a sub-par performance by the U.S. frozen segment. FISCAL 2004 TARGET Looking forward to Fiscal 2004, Heinz is targeting full-year EPS in the range of $2.15 to $2.25, consistent with Heinz's long-term target of 8-10% EPS growth. The target for net sales growth is 3-4%, (excluding divestitures) with operating free cash flow of $700 million to $1 billion. The Fiscal 2004 outlook includes the estimated impact of increased pension and healthcare costs of around $50 million and several small non-core divestitures. 2
Heinz expects to have an effective tax rate of 33-33.5%, taking into account country mix and effective tax planning. Mr. Johnson added: "The key to achieving our objectives in Fiscal Year 2004 will be the Four Business Imperatives that Heinz adopted after the completion of the Del Monte transaction. We have embraced a global process of continuous improvement that is focused on building superior shareholder value." The Four Business Imperatives, which were unveiled in January, are: o DRIVE PROFITABLE GROWTH through investment in innovation and creative marketing to support Heinz's top 15 brands around the world; o REMOVING THE CLUTTER by improving the efficiency of the company's business structure and processes while streamlining and focusing its supply chain through continued SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) reduction; o SQUEEZING OUT COSTS through improved efficiency in trade promotion spending, productivity enhancements in the supply chain, reduced fixed costs and continued improvement in working capital and capital expenditure efficiency so that more resources can be focused on supporting brand growth; and o MEASURING AND RECOGNIZING PERFORMANCE through a balanced scorecard that aligns employee compensation more closely with business activities that drive shareholder value. FISCAL 2003 RESULTS Heinz reported net income for the year of $566.3 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared with $833.9 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, in the previous fiscal year. 3
Excluding special items and the Fiscal 2003 cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Heinz reported earnings from continuing operations of $717.7 million or $2.03 per diluted share, which compares with $684.1 million, or $1.94 per diluted share for these operations in the previous fiscal year. (The results of the spun-off businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations. Comments that follow refer to the results of continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.) Fiscal 2003 sales grew by 8.2% to $8.24 billion, driven by favorable pricing of 4.2%, foreign exchange translation rates of 5.6% and acquisitions (net of divestitures) of 0.3%, partially offset by a 2.0% decline in volume. Excluding hyperinflationary countries, the increase due to pricing was 1.3% and the volume decrease was also 1.3%, mostly due to the continued impact of previously announced SKU rationalization of low-margin products across the company. During Fiscal 2003, the company recognized charges totaling $162.4 million after tax, or $0.46 per share related to the following special items: the previously announced Heinz/Del Monte transaction; costs to reduce overhead of the remaining core businesses; exiting a U.K. pizza business; and the loss on the sale of Omstead Foods, a Canadian-based frozen fish and vegetable business. Fiscal 2002 results were negatively impacted by net restructuring charges and implementation costs totaling $8.9 million after tax, or $0.03 per share. Also, during the second quarter of Fiscal 2003, the company completed its transitional impairment review related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" and recognized a non-cash charge of $77.8 million or $0.22 per share for impairment of goodwill. This charge is reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle effective May 2, 2002. Had the provisions of the standard been applied retroactive to May 3, 2001, net income from continuing operations would have been $720.4 million, or $0.13 per share higher in Fiscal 2002. EPS from discontinued operations was $0.25 per share in Fiscal 2003, compared to $0.45 in the prior year, reflecting the shorter period of ownership in the current year compared to last year. 4
HIGHLIGHTS HEINZ NORTH AMERICA Sales in Heinz North America increased 2.5% for the year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher pricing. Operating income decreased 7.0% due to increased manufacturing costs, increased marketing behind Heinz Easy Squeeze!(R) Ketchup, Classico(R) pasta sauce, and the "Insist on Heinz" campaign, and higher selling, general & administrative expenses. Heinz(R) Ketchup share reached an all-time-high of 76% in Canada. In the U.S. the Heinz(R) Easy Squeeze!(R) upside-down ketchup bottle has grown to 14% of Heinz's retail ketchup business. While the economic downturn impacted Heinz and the entire foodservice industry in Fiscal 2003, Heinz is experiencing a foodservice turnaround in the new Fiscal Year. The red Forever Full(TM) Ketchup Bottle now is almost 40% of the foodservice tabletop ketchup business. Heinz's bulk foodservice ketchup business continues to grow with innovative packaging, such as the #10 Pour, Store & Pump Jug, which sold nearly one-half million cases in the fiscal year. EZ Marinader(R), a sauce and marinading pouch concept, was introduced to consumers in May and achieved 90% retail distribution in just one month. U.S. FROZEN Sales for U.S. Frozen brands for the year decreased 1.3%; acquisitions increased sales 6.8%. Volume for the base business declined 4.5%, despite strong performance by Smart Ones(R) frozen entrees, which grew 7% in Fiscal 2003 and is now the company's third-largest brand. This strong performance was offset by declines in frozen side dishes and disappointing results from the Ore-Ida Funky Fries(R) and Hot Bites(R) introductions, which particularly impacted earnings in the fourth quarter. However, the Poppers(R) and TGIF(R) brands are growing rapidly, while the Bagel Bites(R) line is being restaged and The Boston Market(R) range is being refocused against traditional entrees. 5
HEINZ EUROPE Sales for the year in Heinz Europe increased 11.1% due to favorable foreign exchange translation rates and higher pricing for Heinz(R) beans, ketchup and soups. Heinz businesses in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands performed particularly well. In the U.K. increased volume for Heinz(R) frozen entrees and Heinz(R) Ketchup were offset by lower volumes in frozen pizza (recently exited) and the elimination of numerous SKUs. Heinz U.K., began marketing a frozen snack under the "Bite Me"(R) brand and has launched Soup Cups(R), on-the-go containers of Heinz(R) soup favorites. The company's canned pasta received a boost with the introduction of pasta shapes with X-Men(R), Spiderman(R) and Winnie the Pooh(R) pasta shapes. In the Netherlands, Heinz extended the popular Roosvicee(R) drinks line with varieties designed for sale at gas stations and sports centers, along with other away-from-home venues. Heinz Italy infant feeding volume grew 3% and the company unveiled Plasmon(R) Junior Biscuits, the first biscuits especially designed for children over 18 months. In France, Petit Navire(R) Salad Helpers(R) now offer special tuna-based salad toppings. ASIA/PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific for the year were up 17% and operating income increased 52% representing a major turnaround and continued growth in Indonesia and China. In New Zealand, the company's Wattie's(R) brand name has once again topped consumer recognition charts as the nation's number-one supermarket megabrand, ahead of 5,000 others. Market shares for Wattie's(R) canned baked beans and spaghetti are near 90%. Significantly reduced manufacturing costs produced a major turnaround for the Wattie's business in New Zealand, along with a continued strong performance from the affiliate's Tegel(R) poultry brand. Heinz's ABC(R) brand of soy sauce is a consumer staple in Indonesia and holds a market share of 50%. ABC(R) sales grew 26% during the fiscal year. Ketchup shares in Thailand rose to 35% with a new line, Heinz Plus(R) that is fortified with vitamins A and D. Heinz aims to have 4 to 6 businesses in Asia, each with sales of more than $100 million by the end of Fiscal 2005. 6
