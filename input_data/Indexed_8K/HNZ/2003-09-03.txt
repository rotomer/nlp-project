Heinz Company today announced results for the first quarter ended July 30, 2003. Heinz reported net income of $214.0 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared with $100.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the year-earlier quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.53 in the current year versus $0.44 in the prior year, which excludes profit associated with the spun-off business units and the effect of a change in accounting in the prior year related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Excluding special items and the effect of adopting SFAS No. 142, Heinz reported earnings from continuing operations of $179.8 million or $0.51 per diluted share, which compares with $166.0 million, or $0.47 per diluted share for these operations in the year-earlier quarter. (Comments that follow refer to the results of continuing operations, excluding special items. See attached tables for further details.) Commenting on the first quarter, H.J. Heinz Company Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "Heinz's strong first quarter performance indicates continued progress in generating sales, cash and earnings growth, and confirms that Heinz is on track to achieve its EPS, Net Sales and Operating Free Cash Flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) target ranges for Fiscal 2004. Increased volume and improved mix were key factors in driving growth in sales, gross margins and operating income. We are particularly pleased with the continued strength in our ketchup, condiments and sauces business and the growth in our domestic Foodservice and Asia Pacific businesses, all of which performed exceptionally well. "We also continued the significant progress in our balance sheet and cash management initiatives during the quarter, as reduced Working Capital and, in particular, lower inventories helped improve our Cash Conversion Cycle by 14 days versus the year-ago period. We continued to pare net debt and significantly increased Operating Free Cash Flow while at the same time boosting total consumer and trade marketing spending by nearly 15%. All of these achievements affirm the impact of Heinz's growth strategy and the efficacy of our Four Imperatives - to drive profitable growth; remove clutter; squeeze out costs; and measure and recognize performance." H.J. Heinz Company, P.O. Box 57, Pittsburgh 15230-0057
2 First quarter sales grew by 3.1% to $1.90 billion, driven by favorable volume of 2.2% and foreign exchange translation rates of 7.5%, partially offset by a 0.4% decline in price and a 6.3% decline from divestitures, net of acquisitions. The favorable volume impact is primarily due to increases in the North American Consumer Products, U.S. Foodservice and Asia Pacific segments. EPS from discontinued operations was $0.08 per share in the current quarter, reflecting the favorable settlement of prior-year tax liabilities related to the spun-off businesses, versus $0.07 per share in the year-earlier quarter. (On December 20, 2002, Heinz completed the transaction by which it spun off its U.S. and Canadian pet food, U.S. tuna and retail private label soup, and U.S. infant feeding businesses to its shareholders and then merged these businesses with Del Monte Corporation, a subsidiary of Del Monte Foods Company, NYSE:DLM. The results of the spun-off businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations.) Heinz's Gross Profit Margin was 37.5% in the quarter, an increase of 0.9 points over the year-ago period. This improvement reflects the company's progress in reducing less-profitable SKUs and improving sales mix, especially in developing markets. The company's Effective Tax Rate of 33.1% reflects a change in country mix and effective tax planning. FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS In the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in organizational structure and management of its business. The company is now managing and reporting its North American businesses under two segments, designated North American Consumer Products and U.S. Foodservice. Certain changes were also made to the composition of the remaining segments; prior periods have been restated to conform with the current presentation. Heinz is a brand-focused company with a powerful line up of 15 mega-brands, led by the $2.7 billion Heinz brand. More than 60% of the company's sales come from outside the United States. NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales volume in the North American Consumer Products segment was up $18.7 million or 4.1%, driven by strong volume increases in Heinz(R) ketchup and Classico(R) pasta sauces. There was some weakness in frozen food, and the overall business improvement was more than offset by the impact of divestitures, resulting in a segment sales decrease of $3.4 million or 0.7%. Overall, pricing was down 2%, as Heinz continued its strategy of value pricing directly to consumers. Operating income increased $1.4 million, or 1.3%, to $107.8 million. In Canada, Heinz(R) ketchup reached it highest quarterly level in five years and the Classico(R) brand continued its market-leading share of the country's pasta sauce category.
3 U.S. FOODSERVICE U.S. Foodservice's sales rose $23.5 million, or 7.6%, due primarily to a significant volume increase for Heinz(R) ketchup, along with increased sales of Escalon(R) specialty sauces and Dianne's(R) frozen desserts. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales slightly due primarily to the current year acquisition of Truesoups LLC, a manufacturer and marketer of premium frozen soups. Operating income grew $8.6 million, or 20.0%, to $51.7 million, due primarily to volume growth, favorable pricing and sales mix. Heinz's Chairman noted that the acquisition of Truesoups supports the company's leadership position in the premium soup category and expands its customer base among well-known and rapidly growing fast-casual dining chains. "It is a well-focused strategic addition to a powerful foodservice portfolio whose leading brands include Heinz(R) ketchup, Escalon(R) tomato products, Chef Francisco(R) soups and Dessert Inspiration(R) frozen desserts," he said. EUROPE Heinz Europe's sales increased $61.8 million, or 9.2% primarily due to favorable exchange translation rates and significant volume increases in Petit Navire(R) seafood. European sales were impacted by lower volumes in convenience meals and infant feeding due to promotional timing, elimination of low-margin SKUs, and, to a lesser extent, by volume decreases in ready-to-serve soups and Heinz(R) beans due to changes in summer eating patterns induced by the record European heat wave. By contrast, Heinz(R) ketchup volume grew by 6% in the U.K., with dollar market share up 3 points to 76%. The enduringly popular Heinz Salad Cream(R) grew volume by 17%, with its dollar share up more than 5 points, reaching 78%. Operating income increased $6.7 million, or 4.8%, to $146.5 million, largely attributable to improvements in the seafood business and favorable exchange translation rates. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs in Northern Europe as well as sales mix and lower volumes. General and administrative expenses also increased primarily due to exchange and increased pension expense. Heinz Europe has translated the popular U.S. upside-down Heinz Easy Squeeze!(R)ketchup concept into Top Down(R), a packaging concept now rolling out to 19 countries across the European continent. Heinz Europe is re-energizing its German ketchup market with a new flight of television commercials and strong store promotions. The result has been double-digit growth in ketchup sales. In Italy, the Plasmon(R) baby food range introduced 4 varieties of Ready Meals(R) and two new Winnie the Pooh(R) biscuits under license. Russian parents are being introduced to a range of Heinz(R) canned baby foods, which complement the existing range of jarred varieties.
4 ASIA PACIFIC Asia Pacific had an excellent quarter, with volume up a strong 5.2% and sales up $52.8 million, or 22.2%. This was primarily driven by significant volume increases in Tegel(R) poultry in New Zealand and ABC(R) sauces and juice concentrates in Indonesia as well as the favorable impact of exchange translation rates. Operating income rose $15.3 million, to $34.3 million, primarily due to strong net pricing and manufacturing cost improvements in Australia and New Zealand as well as favorable exchange translation rates. Asia Pacific, which now represents 15% of Heinz's global sales, showed solid marketing results, led by Heinz ABC in Indonesia, whose strong showing in seasonal juices and soy sauce helped drive overall sales growth of 45%. Heinz China, despite the difficulties of the SARS epidemic, increased sales by 40%. In New Zealand, the Wattie's(R) range expanded with the addition of Wok Creations(R), a healthful mix of frozen vegetables and stir-fry sauces, and the Good Taste(R) range of dressings and marinades. Heinz Australia's Greenseas(R) tuna range recorded a strong quarter with a significant rise in sales of traditional varieties and new flavored tunas. The company's Very Vegetable(R) soup range concluded the cold-weather season with strong double-digit growth over the prior year. In other developing markets such as Latin America and India, volumes were up 7%, responding to marketing and product innovations. # # MEETING WITH SECURITIES ANALYSTS - INTERNET BROADCASTS Heinz will host a conference call with security analysts today at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern time).
