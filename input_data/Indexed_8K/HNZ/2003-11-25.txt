ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION H. J. Heinz Company wishes to disclose its press release dated November 25, 2003 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.* The attached press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items include, in Fiscal 2004, the impact of reorganization costs following last year's spin-off transaction with Del Monte and the gain on the sale of the company's bakery business in Northern Europe and in Fiscal 2003, reorganization costs related to the Del Monte transaction and overhead reduction costs. Operating segment income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), but it is used by management to assist in evaluating the Registrant's results of operations from period to period. Management believes this information also may be useful to the readers of the financial statements in evaluating the Registrant's operating results between fiscal periods. Also disclosed as Exhibit 99.2* is supplemental information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in connection with the financial results for the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 News Release [HEINZ LOGO] FOR RELEASE UPON RECEIPT HEINZ REPORTS SECOND QUARTER INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $191.5 MILLION OR 54 CENTS PER SHARE VS. $168.5 MILLION OR 48 CENTS PER SHARE IN THE PRIOR YEAR - - EPS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 54 CENTS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS, UP 8% OVER PRIOR YEAR; - - VOLUME GROWS 1.6% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND GROWS 1.9% THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2004; - - IMPROVED SALES MIX, SKU REDUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS HELP INCREASE GROSS MARGINS 150 BASIS POINTS TO 37.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER. PITTSBURGH, November 25, 2003 - H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today announced results for the second quarter ended October 29, 2003. Heinz reported net income of $191.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the period. This compares with the following results for the prior year: - - On a fully reported total company basis, Heinz's current-quarter EPS of $0.54 compares with prior-year earnings of $212.1 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, which included earnings from discontinued operations ($43.5 million, or $0.12 per share) that were spun off and merged with Del Monte Corporation in December 2002. - - On a continuing operations basis, without the profits associated with the spun-off business units, the current quarter diluted EPS of $0.54 is a 13% increase over the earnings of $168.5 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, from continuing operations in the prior-year period. - - For continuing operations excluding special items recorded in Fiscal 2003, Heinz's current quarter diluted EPS of $0.54 is an 8% increase over the EPS of $0.50 for these operations in the year-earlier quarter. (Comments that follow refer to the results of continuing operations, excluding special items. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.) Commenting on the second quarter, H.J. Heinz Company Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "We are pleased with Heinz's results for the second quarter, and the company's performance continues to confirm our confidence in the target ranges we set for EPS, Net Sales and Operating Free Cash Flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) in Fiscal 2004. We saw continued volume, margin and operating income growth in the second quarter, reflecting the improved focus of our international portfolio and strong performances by Heinz(R) Ketchup and our leading sauces brands, our U.S. Foodservice, European seafood and rapidly growing Asia Pacific businesses. We are particularly pleased with the margin performance in Asia Pacific, where the operating income margin increased more than 300 basis points. "We continued to reduce Working Capital, especially accounts receivable and inventories, driving improvement in our Cash Conversion Cycle 8 days versus the second quarter last year. Net debt (total debt, net of the value of interest rate swaps, less cash and cash equivalents) also continued to decline and our Operating Free Cash Flow remained strong and in line with our Fiscal 2004 target. We
2 achieved all of this even as we continued to improve our business mix with strategic divestitures. Looking forward, we remain focused on increasing sales, cash and earnings, which we are successfully driving through the previously announced Four Strategic Imperatives of driving profitable growth, removing clutter, squeezing out costs, and measuring and recognizing performance." Second quarter sales excluding divestitures, net of acquisitions, increased 7.7%, reflecting volume growth of 1.6% and favorable foreign exchange translation rates of 6.0%. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, had a negative impact on sales of 8.1%, causing overall sales for the quarter to decline 0.4% to $2.09 billion. Heinz's Gross Profit Margin was 37.4% in the quarter, an increase of 150 basis points over the year-ago period. This improvement reflects the company's progress in reducing less-profitable SKU's and improving sales mix and productivity, especially in developing markets. Operating income grew more than 2% and was favorably leveraged to 9% growth in income from continuing operations through lower interest costs, reduced minority interest expense and a favorable effective tax rate. EPS from discontinued operations was $0.12 per share in the year-earlier quarter. (On December 20, 2002, Heinz completed the transaction by which it spun off its U.S. and Canadian pet food, U.S. tuna and retail private label soup, and U.S. infant feeding businesses to its shareholders and then merged these businesses with Del Monte Corporation, a subsidiary of Del Monte Foods Company, NYSE:DLM. The results of the spun-off businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations.) SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS North American Consumer Products saw strong performances by Heinz(R) Ketchup, EZ Marinader(R) marinading pouches and Classico(R) pasta sauces. These gains were offset by declines in several frozen brands and the continuing process of rationalizing Boston Market(R) side dishes and Hot Bites(R) frozen snacks. Excluding divestitures, sales for the unit were down 1% versus the prior-year period. Lower pricing decreased sales by 2.9%, consistent with Heinz's Every Day Low Pricing strategy. This decrease was largely offset by favorable Canadian currency translation rates. Operating income decreased $1.4 million, or 1.1%, to $126.5 million, as manufacturing cost savings and decreased consumer marketing expenses related to Boston Market(R) frozen entrees and the prior-year launch of Heinz(R) Easy Squeeze!(TM) upside-down Ketchup were offset by lower net pricing. The company expects similar performance in the third quarter with several previously announced new product innovations such as Ore-Ida(R) Extra Crispy french fries and a new line of Smart Ones(R) frozen entrees for carbohydrate-conscious consumers slated for introduction in the fourth quarter. HEINZ U.S. FOODSERVICE Heinz U.S. Foodservice's sales increased $29.3 million, or 8.6%, reflecting growth in Heinz(R) Ketchup, single-serve condiments, Escalon(R) processed tomato products and Dianne's(R) frozen desserts. The introduction of several innovative new products such as Fry Shakers, Stand-Up Premium Pouches for condiments and jellies, and a restaurant line of Heinz's Delimex(R) Taquitos helped drive foodservice sales growth. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 4.5%, mainly due to the acquisition of Truesoups LLC, a manufacturer and marketer of premium frozen soups. Operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.1%, to $57.5 million, primarily due to strong growth in sales and improved gross margins, partially offset by the timing of SG&A costs and investment in infrastructure.
3 EUROPE Heinz Europe's sales increased $60.5 million, or 8.5%, driven by higher volumes for John West(R) and Petit Navire(R) seafood, Heinz(R) Salad Cream and convenience meals, and favorable foreign exchange translation rates. Heinz(R) Ketchup in the U.K. increased its value share to nearly 76%, almost 3 share points higher than a year ago, while Heinz(R) Salad Cream increased its share 4.7 points to more than 78% while driving category growth of nearly 8%. The "Win A House" promotion in the U.K. helped drive 6% volume growth for the core Heinz(R) soups and beans business during the second quarter. Overall volume in Europe increased 1.5%, led by good performance in the U.K. and Western Europe. European volume gains were partially offset by decreases in infant feeding and frozen food products, and the previously announced SKU rationalization of low-margin products. Divestitures reduced sales 2.3%, primarily related to the sale of the U.K. frozen pizza business and the Northern European bakery business. Operating income increased $10.5 million, or 7.8%, to $144.7 million, mostly attributable to favorable exchange translation rates and improved Gross Profit Margin, partially offset by increased General & Administrative expense, mainly related to increased pension expense. ASIA PACIFIC Asia Pacific had another very strong quarter, with sales up $64.6 million, or 23.9%. This was driven by a 6.2% increase in volume and by strong foreign exchange translation rates across the region. Tegel(R) poultry in New Zealand continued to perform well, while Australia achieved double-digit volume growth for the quarter in its leading Heinz(R) sauces and convenience meals and Greenseas(R) tuna. Indonesia's ABC(R) branded soy sauces and juice concentrates delivered strong double-digit sales growth and benefited from holiday promotions that came earlier than last year. New products and packaging also added to volume growth. Divestitures decreased sales by 0.7%. Operating income increased $16.9 million, or 62.8%, to $43.7 million, primarily due to strong volume growth, holiday timing in Indonesia, increased net pricing and manufacturing cost improvements in Australia and New Zealand, as well as favorable exchange translation rates. YEAR TO DATE HIGHLIGHTS Heinz reported income from continuing operations of $371.3 million in the six months ended October 29, 2003, up 8.7% compared to $341.4 million for the year-earlier period (excluding the adoption of SFAS No. 142). Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.05 for the period, an 8.2% increase over $0.97 in the prior year (excluding the adoption of SFAS No. 142). Sales increased 1.2% for the six-month period, driven by strong volume increases of 1.9%, at the top end of the company's 1-2% target range. Gross profit increased 4.7% and the Gross Profit Margin was 37.4%, up 120 basis points versus the prior year. Operating income increased $23.3 million, or 3.6%. The company's balance sheet and cash management showed significant improvement compared to the first half of Fiscal 2003. The Cash Conversion Cycle improved 11 days during the first half of the year compared to the prior-year period, and operating free cash flow improved 18.4% to $418 million. # #
