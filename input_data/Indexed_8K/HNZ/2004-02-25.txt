ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION H. J. Heinz Company wishes to disclose its press release dated February 24, 2004 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.* The attached press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items include, in Fiscal 2004, the impact of reorganization costs following last year's spin-off transaction with Del Monte and the gain on the sale of the company's bakery business in Northern Europe and in Fiscal 2003, reorganization costs related to the Del Monte transaction and overhead reduction costs and loss on the exit of non-strategic businesses. Operating segment income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), but it is used by management to assist in evaluating the Registrant's results of operations from period to period. Management believes this information also may be useful to the readers of the financial statements in evaluating the Registrant's operating results between fiscal periods. Also disclosed on Exhibit 99* is supplemental information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in connection with the financial results for the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2004.

J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today reported net income of $202.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for its third quarter, ended January 28, 2004. This is an increase of 33% versus the third quarter of Fiscal 2003 on a fully reported company basis. Prior-year results include earnings from discontinued operations of $21.8 million, or $0.06 per share, that were spun off and merged with Del Monte Corporation in December 2002. On a continuing operations basis, without the profits associated with the spun-off business units: o The current quarter diluted EPS of $0.57 per share is a 54% increase over the earnings of $0.37 per diluted share from continuing operations in the prior-year period. o The current quarter diluted EPS of $0.57 is a 6% increase over last year's EPS of $0.54 per share for continuing operations, excluding special items that were recorded in Fiscal 2003. (Comments on the third quarter that follow refer to the results of continuing operations, excluding special items. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.) H.J. Heinz Company, P.O. Box 57, Pittsburgh 15230-0057
2 Commenting on the third quarter, H.J. Heinz Company Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "Heinz had another strong performance in earnings and cash flow in the third quarter. We are on target to achieve our full-year Fiscal 2004 forecast range of $2.19 to $2.21 in Earnings Per Share, an 8 - 9% increase over the previous year. Importantly, we are also on pace for record cash flow as a result of a successful focus on working capital reduction. "During the quarter, we supported our leading brands with the successful launch of a number of exciting and innovative products designed to leverage new trends in health, wellness and taste. These include Smart Ones(R) `Truth About Carbs' frozen entrees, Ore-Ida(R) Extra Crispy Crinkle fries and One-Carb Heinz(R) Ketchup - each of whose strong early market results have exceeded our expectations. Heinz's U.S. Foodservice business continued its impressive turnaround with 10.2% sales growth in the third quarter, building on its excellent showing in the first half. As a global food company, we also continued to benefit from favorable foreign exchange translation rates, which are helping us underwrite innovation and creative marketing initiatives to drive growth in our leading brands around the world." Overall, third quarter sales were relatively flat (down 0.4%), as favorable foreign exchange translation rates were offset by the impact of divestitures, net of acquisitions. Base business volume was down slightly for the period, primarily due to the comparison with strong European tuna promotions in the third quarter of last year, competitive and trade pressure in Italy, and the timing of holiday sales in Indonesia. Heinz's Gross Profit Margin was 37.2% in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points over the year-ago period. This improvement reflects the company's progress in reducing less-profitable Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), improving sales mix and productivity gains, especially in developing markets, as well as higher pricing in certain European countries. Operating income declined by 2.3% due to divestitures/deconsolidation, but net income from continuing operations grew 6% through lower interest costs and reduced minority interest expense. (On December 20, 2002, Heinz completed the transaction by which it spun off its U.S. and Canadian pet food, U.S. tuna and retail private label soup, and U.S. infant feeding businesses to its shareholders and then merged these businesses with Del Monte Corporation, a subsidiary of Del Monte Foods Company, NYSE:DLM. The results of the spun-off businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations.) THIRD QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment decreased $14.0 million, or 2.6%, as favorable Canadian exchange rates were offset by divestitures. Volume rose 0.1%, and was impacted by the southern California grocery store strike and the effect of the low-carb diet phenomenon on the frozen entree category. Significant growth in Heinz(R) Ketchup and Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes WAs offset by declines in Canadian juices due to the timing of pricing. In
3 line with Heinz's pricing strategy, lower pricing decreased sales 2.4%, as the Company invested in achieving more competitive Every Day Low Pricing across several leading brands. Innovation helped drive significant volume increases for Heinz(R) Ketchup and Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes, aided by the launch Of Ore-Ida(R) Extra Crispy Crinkle french fries, designed for consumers who want homemade french fries with the crunchiness of away-from-home fries. Sales in the quarter also benefited from the new Smart Ones(R) "Truth About Carbs" line of frozen entrees featuring six new recipes based on a smart balance of protein, fat and carbohydrates. Four of the new items quickly ranked among the brand's top five sellers. The introduction of these Smart Ones(R) varieties helped the brand's share of the nutritional meals category grow nearly two points during the critical January diet month. The Company expects improving volume trends to continue on Smart Ones(R) through the rest of the fiscal year. Operating income increased 2.6%, as productivity improvements more than offset the revenue impact of lower pricing. HEINZ U.S. FOODSERVICE Heinz's U.S. Foodservice sales grew 10.2%, or $32.8 million, reflecting the acquisition of Truesoups LLC, as well as strong base business growth. Sales volume improved 3.6%, primarily due to increases in Heinz(R) Ketchup, single-serve condiments, Escalon(R) tomato products and Dianne's(R) frozen desserts. Operating income increased 6.1%, primarily reflecting double-digit sales growth and improved pricing, partially offset by higher commodity costs. EUROPE Heinz Europe's sales rose $58.3 million, or 7.6%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 12.9%, partially offset by lower base business volume and divestitures. Lower volumes decreased sales 4.2%, primarily attributable to declines in European seafood and competitive and trade pressure in Italy. Reduced seafood volume reflects the overlap of strong promotional activity in the third quarter of Fiscal 2003, as the business was rebounding from an earlier product recall. Volume was also impacted by the continuing reduction of low-profit SKUs, which had a positive impact on gross margins. These decreases were partially offset by double-digit volume growth in Heinz(R) Ketchup, as record ketchup market shares were reached in the U.K. (76%), France (29%), Sweden (30%), Spain (23%), Denmark (31%) and Ireland (51%). Heinz Europe introduced a range of new products in the quarter, including the launch of the "Top-Down" ketchup bottle in 12 European countries and two new frozen potato varieties - Weight Watchers(R) roasted potatoes and Aunt Bessie's(R) mashed potatoes. Operating income increased 15.5%, mainly due to favorable foreign exchange translation rates and improved gross margins.
4 ASIA PACIFIC Sales in Asia Pacific grew $27.6 million, or 10.1%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 18.0%. After a very strong first-half performance (during which volume increased 5.8%), third quarter volume decreased sales 3.4%, primarily due to holiday timing of juice concentrate sales in Indonesia and the continuing reduction of low-profit SKUs. Lower pricing decreased sales 3.8%, reflecting declines in Tegel(R) resulting from lower short-term market prices for New Zealand poultry. Operating income increased 16.1%, driven by significant supply chain savings and favorable foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by decreased pricing. YEAR TO DATE HIGHLIGHTS Heinz reported net income of $607.7 million in the nine months ended January 28, 2004, up 31.1% compared to $463.7 million for the year-earlier period. Net income from continuing operations, excluding special items in both periods, was $573.5 million, up 7.6% compared to $532.9 million. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.62 for the period, a 7.3% increase over $1.51 in the prior year (excluding special items). Sales increased 0.7% for the nine-month period, driven by strong volume increases in the Asia Pacific and Foodservice segments and the benefit of favorable foreign currency exchange rates, which was partially offset by divestitures/deconsolidation. Gross profit increased 3.7% and the Gross Profit Margin was 37.3%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year. Operating income increased $104.9 million, or 11.1%. Excluding special items in both periods, operating income increased 1.5%, while net income rose by 7.6%. The company's balance sheet and cash management showed significant improvement compared to the first nine months of Fiscal 2003. The Cash Conversion Cycle improved 10 days during the first nine months of the year compared to the prior-year period, and operating free cash flow improved 49% to $697 million.
