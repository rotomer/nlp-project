Exhibit 99 [Heinz Graphic] News Release "GOOD FOOD, EVERY DAY" FOR RELEASE UPON RECEIPT HEINZ BOARD INCREASES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND BY 5.5% BEGINNING IN JULY; DECLARES REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYABLE IN APRIL PITTSBURGH, March 10, 2004 -- The H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) announced today that its Board of Directors approved a 5.5% increase in the annual dividend on common stock for Fiscal Year 2005 (from 27 cents to 28.5 cents per quarter), effective with the July 2004 dividend. At yesterday's closing share price of $38.08, this new dividend yield would be approximately 3.0%, ranking Heinz in the top 20% of the S&P 500. "This decision by our Board of Directors confirms the success of our growth strategy across our global businesses. Our operating free cash flow has met the stringent goals that we developed and has enabled us to increase dividends at a rate much greater than inflation, while maintaining our commitment to return 45-50% of earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends," noted William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Heinz has paid uninterrupted dividends ever since we went public in 1946, a period of 58 years. By increasing the dividend in July, at the beginning of our fiscal year, we will better align Heinz dividend payments with our fiscal-year operating cycle," Mr. Johnson said. DIVIDEND DECLARATION FOR APRIL 2004 The Heinz Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of: COMMON STOCK - ------------ 27 cents per share on the company's 25 cent par value Common Stock payable April 10, 2004 to shareholders of record the close of business on March 24, 2004. PREFERRED STOCK - --------------- 42 1/2 cents per share on the company's Third Cumulative Preferred Stock, $1.70 First Series, payable April 1, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 24, 2004. ## SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:
