ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION H. J. Heinz Company wishes to disclose its press release dated August 24, 2004 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99*, which presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items include, in Fiscal Year 2004, the impact of reorganization costs and the gain on the sale of the company's bakery business in Northern Europe. Operating segment income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), but it is used by management to assist in evaluating the Registrant's results of operations from period to period. Management believes this information also may be useful to the readers of the financial statements in evaluating the Registrant's operating results between fiscal periods and provides additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business. Also disclosed on Exhibit 99* is supplemental information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in connection with the financial results for the first quarters of Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005.

Exhibit 99 NEWS RELEASE HEINZ logo World Headquarters "THE GOOD FOOD COMPANY" HEINZ REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS IN LINE WITH SALES, CASH & EARNINGS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2005 o EPS OF 55 CENTS VS. 60 CENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR WHICH INCLUDED DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND SPECIAL ITEMS o EPS OF 55 CENTS UP 7.8% OVER PRIOR-YEAR EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS o SALES INCREASE 5.7%, WITH VOLUME UP 1.9% REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND EUROPE o CASH CONVERSION CYCLE REDUCED 12 DAYS VERSUS PRIOR YEAR PITTSBURGH - August 24, 2004 - H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today reported net income of $194.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the Fiscal 2005 first quarter ended July 28, 2004. This compares to $214.0 million, or $0.60 per share, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, which included profit associated with business units spun off to Del Monte Foods along with special items. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, Heinz's first quarter EPS in Fiscal 2005 increased 7.8% over earnings of $179.8 million, or $0.51 per diluted share for the prior-year period. Commenting on the Company's performance, H.J. Heinz Company Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "Heinz is off to a strong start in Fiscal 2005, with first quarter results consistent with our full-year outlook. Innovation continues to drive profitable growth in our top brands, most notably Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes, which had excellent results behind the launch of our exciting new Extra Crispy(TM) and Easy Fries(TM) lines. This, combined with restaging and repricing initiatives around the world, helped generate strong first quarter sales and volume growth against our full-year objective of net sales growth of 2-3%. At the same time, we continued to remove clutter and squeeze out cost to improve our cash management and balance sheet performance, with reduced working capital and a 12-day improvement in the Cash Conversion Cycle. Overall, our first quarter performance is in line with our full-year target ranges of EPS of $2.32 - $2.42 and Operating Free Cash Flow of $800 million - $1 billion." Heinz's positive earnings performance reflected strong first quarter sales growth of 5.7% due to a combination of favorable foreign exchange rates and a 1.9% increase in volume/mix. The volume/mix improvement was driven mainly by very strong volume growth of 6.7% in the North American Consumer Products business, primarily in frozen brands such as Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes. Europe's volume increased 2.1%, reflecting strong volume growth in the U.K. and Italy. The Company also noted robust sales growth of 7.8% for its top 15 power brands. These volume increases were partially offset by a 1.0% drop in net pricing related to the Company's product restage in Italy and market pressure in the Netherlands and New Zealand.
2 The Company's balance sheet and working capital management showed continued improvement over the Fiscal 2004 first quarter. Operating Free Cash Flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) was $148 million in the quarter, the Cash Conversion Cycle improved 12 days, and net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents and the value of interest rate swaps) was reduced by $320 million versus the prior-year period. (Comments on the first quarter that follow refer to the results from continuing operations, excluding special items, in Fiscal 2004. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they provide management with a view of the business excluding special items.) Heinz's Gross Profit Margin was 36.9% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points over the year-ago period. The decrease in the Gross Profit Margin was due mainly to increased trade promotion spending and higher commodity costs. Operating income increased 3.0%, primarily due to the favorable sales increase, partially offset by the reduced Gross Profit Margin and increases in SG&A. The higher SG&A cost largely reflects fuel cost inflation and the switch from stock options to performance-based pay, partially offset by reduced consumer marketing. Income from continuing operations grew 8.4%, mainly reflecting higher operating results, reduced interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 8.4%. Volume increased sales 6.7%, due to significant growth in Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes behind the successful launch of the innovative Extra Crispy(TM) and microwaveable Easy Fries(TM) lines and the extension of the Smart Ones(R) Truth About Carbs(TM) line. Volume also grew in Delimex(R) and TGI Friday's(R) frozen snacks and appetizers. Acquisitions increased sales 2.6%, due to the prior-year purchase of the Canadian operations of Unifine Richardson B.V., which manufactures and sells salad dressings, sauces, and dessert toppings. The divestiture of Ethnic Gourmet Foods(R) and Rosetto(R) pasta during the quarter reduced sales 1.1%. Aided by the popularity of its innovative Easy Squeeze!(TM) upside-down bottle and expanded distribution of its One Carb ketchup, Heinz(R) Ketchup's U.S. market share remained strong, exceeding 60%. Heinz(R) Homestyle Gravy also recorded volume and market share growth, reflecting the positive impact of the Company's EDLP initiatives for these brands. Operating income increased 3.1%, driven by the increase in volume and lower consumer marketing, partially offset by higher commodity and fuel costs. HEINZ U.S. FOODSERVICE Heinz's U.S. Foodservice business increased sales 3.8%. Acquisitions increased sales 2.4% due to the prior year purchase of Truesoups LLC, a manufacturer and marketer of premium frozen soups. Higher pricing drove sales up 2.2% chiefly due to increases on Heinz(R) Ketchup
3 and single serve condiments, Chef Francisco(R) frozen soups, and Dianne's(R) and Alden Merrell(R) frozen desserts. Sales volume decreased 0.7%, primarily due to customer service issues at Portion Pac Inc. resulting from the startup of a new warehouse management system that temporarily impacted shipments of some portion control products early in the quarter. Operating income increased 5.1%, primarily due to favorable pricing, sales mix and the Truesoups acquisition, partially offset by higher commodity and distribution costs. EUROPE Heinz Europe's sales increased 7.3%. Favorable exchange translation rates boosted sales by 8.4%, with volume increasing 2.1% due primarily to strong performance in the U.K. and Italy. Key growth initiatives included the successful expansion of Heinz(R) Ketchup's new Top Down(TM) bottle, the relaunch of the Plasmon(R) baby food line in Italy, growth in Heinz(R) ready-to-serve soups, introduction of new Weight Watchers(R) frozen products and expanded retail distribution of frozen desserts in the U.K. Heinz(R) Ketchup hit a new market share record in the U.K. (78%), with Heinz(R) Salad Cream's share surpassing 79%. Heinz(R) Ketchup's market share exceeded 31% in France and reached new record highs in Germany, Spain and Switzerland. Lower pricing decreased sales 2.2%, primarily due to increased trade promotion spending related to the restage of the Italian infant feeding business and pricing pressures in Northern Europe. Divestitures lowered sales by 1% as the company continued to improve the focus of its European business. Operating income increased 5.2%, mainly due to strong sales volume and favorable currency exchange translation rates. These benefits were partially offset by increased trade promotional spending to improve price competitiveness in Italy and The Netherlands together with unfavorable raw material and production costs for the European seafood business. ASIA PACIFIC Sales in Asia Pacific increased 1.5%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 4.2%. Volumes decreased sales by 1.0% as volume increases in New Zealand and Indonesia were more than offset by declines, primarily in Japan. Lower pricing decreased sales 1.7% as Tegel(R) poultry responded to continuing market pressures in New Zealand. Creative marketing and innovation helped drive growth in Heinz(R) soups and beans in Australia, offset by declines in baby food and frozen vegetables. Wattie's(R) in New Zealand also grew sales in soups, beans and spaghetti meals through innovative recipes and strong trade support. Operating income decreased 5.8%, primarily due to reduced pricing in New Zealand. # #

8 H.J. HEINZ COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES SPECIAL ITEMS - FIRST QUARTER JULY 30, 2003 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's reported results from continuing operations to the results excluding special items for the first quarter ended July 30, 2003: (Note: Totals may not add due to rounding.)
9 H.J. HEINZ COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Non-GAAP Performance Ratios The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides the calculation of those non-GAAP performance ratios discussed in the Company's press release dated August 24, 2004: * The adoption of SFAS No. 150 by the Company in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004 required the prospective classification of Heinz Finance Company's $325 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred shares from minority interest to long-term debt. The prior period calculation of net debt includes the effects of this reclassification in order to provide more meaningful comparisons with the current period.
