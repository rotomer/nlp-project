ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated November 23, 2004 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items include, in the six months ended October 29, 2003, the impact of reorganization costs, incurred primarily as a result of our efforts to "right-size" our business subsequent to the Del Monte transaction, which reduced our worldwide revenue base by 20%, and the gain on the sale of the company's bakery business in Northern Europe. Operating segment income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believe are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measures of operating free cash flow and net debt as defined below. These measures are utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, and management believes these measures provide clarity in understanding the trends of the business. Management, and investors, can benefit from the use of the operating free cash flow measure as it provides cash flow derived from product sales and the short-term application of cash, including the effect of capital expenditures. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures that is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Net debt is an additional measure that is important to our liquidity and financial condition. Disclosed on Exhibit 99 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the second quarter and six month year-to-date periods for Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005.

EXHIBIT 99 NEWS RELEASE (HEINZ LOGO) WORLD HEADQUARTERS "THE GOOD FOOD COMPANY" HEINZ REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS AND RECONFIRMS FULL-YEAR EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2005 o EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF 56 CENTS VS. 54 CENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, UP 3.7% o SALES INCREASED 5.2%, WITH VOLUME UP 0.5% REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS o CASH CONVERSION CYCLE REDUCED BY 8 DAYS VERSUS PRIOR YEAR PITTSBURGH - November 23, 2004 - H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today reported net income of $199.0 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the Fiscal 2005 second quarter ended October 27, 2004, and $197.3 million in net income from continuing operations or $0.56 EPS. This compares to $191.5 million, or $0.54 per share, for the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. Heinz's second quarter EPS from continuing operations in Fiscal 2005 increased 3.7% over the prior year. Commenting on the Company's performance, H.J. Heinz Company Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "During the second quarter, Heinz continued to make progress as we built on our Four Imperatives of driving profitable growth, removing clutter, squeezing out costs and measuring and recognizing performance." Heinz's positive earnings performance reflected strong second quarter sales growth of 5.2%, driven by a combination of favorable foreign exchange rates and a 0.5% increase in volume/mix. The volume/mix improvement was driven mainly by strong volume growth of 3.4% in the North American Consumer Products business, primarily in frozen brands such as Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes and Delimex(R) snacks. Net pricing decreased sales 0.1%, as pricing improvements in the North American Consumer Products and U.S. Foodservice segments were offset by a $21.1 million charge for trade spending for the Italian infant nutrition business. The charge relates to prior years and reflects an under-accrual quantified as the Company was upgrading trade management processes and systems in Italy. Pricing for the quarter was also unfavorably impacted by market pressure in the Netherlands and the Tegel(R) poultry business in New Zealand. Heinz's Gross Profit Margin was 36.4% in the quarter, a decrease of 1.0 percentage point over the year-ago period. The decrease in the Gross Profit Margin was due mainly to unfavorable raw material and production costs in the European seafood business, the Italian trade spending charge, increased commodity and fuel costs, and market price pressures impacting the Tegel(R) poultry business. Operating income decreased 1.6% from last year, primarily due to the Gross Profit Margin decline offset by sales growth and favorable exchange rates. Income from continuing operations grew 3.0%, mainly due to a lower effective tax rate and reduced currency losses.
2 The Company's balance sheet and working capital management showed continued improvement over the Fiscal 2004 second quarter, as management focused successfully on inventory control and demand forecasting. Cash Conversion Cycle improved 8 days, and net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents and the value of interest rate swaps) was reduced by $312 million, or 7.9%, versus the prior-year period. Operating free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) was almost $150 million in the quarter. (Comments on the second quarter and six months that follow refer to results from continuing operations, excluding special items. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they provide management with a view of the business excluding special items.) SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 8.4%. Volume increased 3.4% as a result of significant growth in frozen potatoes, primarily in the Ore-Ida(R) brand, due to the introduction of Ore-Ida(R) Extra Crispy Potatoes and new microwavable Easy Fries(TM). Strong growth in Delimex(R) snacks also contributed to the volume increase, which was partially offset by declines in Canadian juice sales. Pricing increased 3.7%, largely due to more efficient trade spending on Smart Ones(R) frozen entrees, Ore-Ida(R) potatoes, and Classico(R) pasta sauces. Acquisitions increased sales 2.1%, due to the prior year acquisition of the Canadian operations of Unifine Richardson B.V., which manufactures and sells salad dressings, sauces, and dessert toppings. The divestiture of Ethnic Gourmet Foods(R) and Rosetto(R) pasta reduced sales 1.6%. Operating income increased 6.7%, driven by increases in sales volume and net pricing, which were partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and higher fuel and commodity costs. HEINZ U.S. FOODSERVICE Heinz's U.S. Foodservice business increased sales 2.1%, driven largely by a 1.8% increase in net pricing that was initiated to offset fuel and commodity cost pressures. Favorable volume in processed tomato products and frozen desserts, partially offset by a decline in single-serve condiments, resulted in volume growth of 0.3%. Heinz continued to leverage its foodservice culinary expertise, as innovative, customized sauces and ready-made soups helped earn significant new business with several national quick-serve-restaurant chains. Operating income increased 0.9%, primarily due to favorable pricing that was partially offset by increased commodity, fuel, and transportation costs.
3 EUROPE Heinz Europe's sales increased 5.2%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 9.1%. Volume decreased 0.6% due primarily to softness in European seafood, which was partially offset by increases in Heinz(R) Ketchup resulting from the successful introduction of the Top Down bottle, growth from the newly introduced Weight Watchers(R) products in the frozen foods category, increases in Heinz(R) ready-to-serve soups and the restage of the Italian infant nutrition business. Lower pricing decreased sales 3.0%, as price increases in Heinz(R) Ketchup and soups were more than offset by the charge for trade spending for the Italian infant nutrition business and decreased pricing related to European seafood and market price pressures in the Netherlands. Divestitures reduced sales 0.4%. Operating income decreased 13.3%, mainly due to lower pricing and increased product costs in the European seafood business, and the charge for Italian trade spending. ASIA PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased 3.0%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 5.0%. Volume decreased sales 1.2%, as strong volume in frozen food products in the New Zealand business was more than offset by declines from the discontinuation of an Indonesian energy drink as well as declines in the Tegel(R) poultry business in New Zealand, and tuna and infant feeding sales in Australia and China. Lower pricing reduced sales 0.7% primarily due to market price pressures on Tegel(R) poultry. Operating income decreased 2.0%, as the favorable impact of exchange translation rates in Australia and New Zealand and improved sales mix in Indonesia were offset by Tegel(R) poultry's lower pricing and increased consumer marketing expense across the region. YEAR TO DATE HIGHLIGHTS Heinz reported income from continuing operations of $392.1 million in the six months ended October 27, 2004, up 5.6% compared to income from continuing operations of $371.3 million for the year-earlier period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.11 for the period, a 5.7% increase over $1.05 in the prior year. Sales increased 5.4% for the six-month period, driven by volume increases of 1.2%, which is within the Company's 1-2% annual volume target range, and exchange translation rates of 4.2%. The favorable volume impact is mainly due to strong increases in the North American Consumer Products and Europe segments. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in Israel following a product recall in the third quarter of Fiscal 2004. The Gross Profit Margin was 36.6%, down 80 basis points versus the prior year, due primarily to lower pricing and increased product costs in the European seafood business, the charge for Italian trade spending, commodity cost increases, and market-price pressures impacting the Tegel(R) poultry and Latin American businesses. Operating income increased $4.3 million, or 0.6%.
4 Through the first half of the fiscal year, the Cash Conversion Cycle, at 60 days, is 9 days better than the comparable period in the prior year. The improvement primarily reflects reductions in days outstanding for both receivables and inventories. Operating free cash flow for the six-month period stands at almost $300 million, in line with our expectations. LOOKING FORWARD Looking forward to the balance of Fiscal 2005, the Company remains on track with its full-year EPS target range of $2.32 - $2.42, with an expectation toward the lower half of that range. Projected operating free cash flow for Fiscal 2005 also remains on track with the Company's target range of $800 million to $1 billion, with an expectation toward the lower end of the range. In addition to Heinz's corporate initiatives, Heinz is assisting The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: HAIN) with certain cost savings programs that Hain is pursuing with the intention of improving its shareholder value over the next 12 months. Although Heinz continues to be optimistic about the prospects for Hain, which operates in the fast-growing natural and organic categories, if the market value of Hain stock remains at current levels, Heinz may be required to write down its investment in Hain to market value prior to the end of Fiscal 2005, in accordance with accounting rules. However, any such potential write-down is not included in Heinz's earnings outlook for Fiscal 2005. Heinz currently owns approximately six million shares of Hain stock at an average basis of approximately $30.00 per share as of October 27, 2004. Recently, the Company and the holders of outstanding remarketable securities due 2020 in the aggregate amount of $800 million agreed to change the remarketing date from November 15 to December 1 beginning this year and to change the maturity date of the securities to December 1, 2020 from November 15, 2020. The Company currently plans to remarket the securities on December 1, 2004. In the event that the securities are not remarketed for any reason, the Company would repurchase the securities for the principal amount of $800 million plus a premium of approximately $125 million, which would be reflected as a charge in the financial statements for the third quarter of Fiscal 2005. Any such potential charge is not included in Heinz's earnings outlook for Fiscal 2005. # # MEETING WITH SECURITIES ANALYSTS - INTERNET BROADCASTS Heinz will host a conference call with security analysts today at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time).
