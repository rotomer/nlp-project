ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated February 28, 2005 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items include, in the three and nine months ended January 26, 2005, non-cash asset impairment charges for cost and equity investments. For the nine months ended January 28, 2004, they include the impact of reorganization costs, incurred primarily as a result of efforts to "right-size" our business subsequent to the Del Monte transaction, which reduced our worldwide revenue base by 20%, and the gain on the sale of the company's bakery business in Northern Europe. Operating segment income and net income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believe are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measures of operating free cash flow and net debt as defined below. These measures are utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, and management believes these measures provide clarity in understanding the trends of the business. Management, and investors, can benefit from the use of the operating free cash flow measure as it provides cash flow derived from product sales and the short-term application of cash, including the effect of capital expenditures. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures that is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of an operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. Net debt is an additional measure that is important to our liquidity and financial condition. Disclosed on Exhibit 99 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the third quarter and nine month year-to-date periods for Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005.

EXHIBIT 99 NEWS RELEASE (HEINZ LOGO) WORLD HEADQUARTERS "THE GOOD FOOD COMPANY" FOR RELEASE UPON RECEIPT HEINZ DELIVERS STRONG TOP-LINE GROWTH IN Q3 AS SALES INCREASE 7.8% o Volume increased almost 4% for the quarter o Q3 earnings impacted by commodity and fuel costs, offset by lower tax rate o Full-year earnings expected to be in previously communicated range, excluding special items o Reported earnings for Q3 reflect asset impairment charge of $74 million after tax, or 21 cents per share PITTSBURGH - February 28, 2005 - H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today announced strong sales increases of 7.8% for its third quarter, led by particularly strong performances on Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes, Bagel Bites(R), TGI Friday's(R) frozen snacks and Heinz(R) Ketchup. Overall, the Company reported net income of $152.4 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for its third quarter ended January 26, 2005. The current quarter includes $73.8 million of non-cash asset impairment charges, primarily related to Heinz's investment in The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:HAIN), the possibility of which was disclosed in the November 23 second-quarter earnings release. Excluding these impairment charges and income of $0.04 per diluted share from discontinued operations, net income for the current quarter was $212.4 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, up 5.3% from the prior quarter. The Company's effective tax rate, excluding special items in the current quarter, was 22.7% compared to 33.1% last year. The reduction in the effective tax rate is attributable to tax planning in foreign jurisdictions and favorable audit settlements. Commenting on the results, Heinz's Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "I am pleased by our strong sales increase of 7.8% and the positive results from many of our recent innovations. I am particularly pleased by the strong sales and profit growth delivered by our North American businesses, especially U.S. Consumer Products. This growth reaffirms our decision to realign and simplify our North American portfolio as part of our current three-year plan. We are exploring similar strategic options for our businesses outside of North America." "Our focus on developing markets is progressing well. Heinz India posted significant sales growth, as did the Company's other businesses in Poland, Russia and parts of Asia," Mr. Johnson commented. H.J. Heinz Company, P.O. Box 57, Pittsburgh 15230-0057
2 "Looking forward to the balance of Fiscal 2005, excluding special items, Heinz remains on track with our full-year EPS target range of $2.32 - 2.42, with an expectation toward the lower end of the range," he said. Gross profit increased 5.2%, despite a 90-basis-point decline in gross profit margin. The decline in gross margin reflects increased commodity and fuel costs, lower pricing and substantially higher supply chain costs in the European seafood business. Operating income decreased 7.3%, due primarily to the lower gross profit margin and increased Selling, General and Administrative expenses ("SG&A"). As a percentage of sales, selling and delivery costs increased due to substantially higher fuel and trucking costs. General and Administrative expenses ("G&A") increased primarily as a result of increased employee-related costs, litigation costs and professional fees related to various projects, including increased administrative expenses associated with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Heinz's balance sheet and working capital management showed continued improvement over the prior year. Cash Conversion Cycle for the quarter improved five days, and net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents and the value of interest rate swaps) was reduced by $138 million versus the prior-year period. Operating Free Cash Flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) was $78 million in the quarter, after a $125 million tax pre-payment in Europe. The Company said it now expects operating free cash flow to be in the range of $750 to $850 million for Fiscal Year 2005. (Comments on the third quarter and nine months that follow refer to results from continuing operations, excluding special items. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they provide management with a view of the business excluding special items.) THIRD-QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased at a strong double digit rate of 11.0%. Volume increased a significant 6.7%, reflecting strong growth in Ore-Ida(R) brand products, Bagel Bites(R) and TGI Friday's(R) frozen snacks. Heinz's marketing programs for these brands have been very effective and consumers have responded positively to new recipes and packaging. Sales of the Ore-Ida(R) brand increased 12.0% and Bagel Bites(R) expanded by 23.0% during the quarter. In addition to strong volume and sales growth in Consumer Products, gross profit increased by 11% versus last year, enabled by very effective trade management and customer service initiatives. Heinz looks forward to continued growth in Consumer Products, with plans to launch a new kids-oriented ketchup this summer. Pricing increased 2.8%, primarily related to Heinz(R) Ketchup, Bagel Bites(R) and TGI Friday's(R) frozen snacks, and Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes. The prior year acquisition of the Unifine Richardson business in Canada, which manufactures and sells salad dressings, sauces and dessert toppings, increased sales by 1.8%. Divestitures reduced sales 1.4% due to the sale of
3 Ethnic Gourmet Foods(R) and Rosetto(R) pasta in the first quarter of Fiscal 2005. Operating income increased 17.2%, as the substantial increases in sales volume and net pricing offset higher commodity, fuel and pension costs. Heinz U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased 5.9%. Strong volume increased sales 4.5%, largely driven by the strength of the Truesoups(R) frozen soup business and by increased sales of custom recipe tomato products, as well as sales improvements in single-serve condiments and Heinz(R) Ketchup. Heinz's restaurant sales are responding well to its new solutions-oriented operating model for soups, desserts and sauces. Higher pricing increased sales by 1.4%, reflecting price increases on ketchup and frozen soup, implemented to offset fuel and commodity cost pressures. Operating income was virtually flat to prior year as favorable pricing and mix were offset by increased commodity, fuel and fixed selling costs. Europe Heinz Europe's sales increased 6.9%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 7.9%. Volume increased 1.5% principally due to promotional timing on European seafood, increased Heinz(R) Ketchup sales behind the successful introduction of the new "Top Down" bottle, the successful restage of Heinz(R) beans and growth in the Italian infant nutrition business. These marketing successes were partially offset by declines in sauces and jarred vegetables in the Netherlands related to increased competition and pricing pressures. Lower pricing decreased sales 2.2%, due to the cost of the Italian infant nutrition restage and increased promotional spending in the Netherlands. Although Heinz's U.K. unit experienced some softness, its overall core business remains healthy and during the quarter, it achieved record market shares for Heinz(R) Ketchup (81%) and Heinz(R) Salad Cream (83%). In Italy, consumption grew 6% in the infant nutrition category, boosted by the success of new Plasmon(R) marketing initiatives. Operating income decreased 21.2% due to lower pricing, increased commodity and supply chain costs in the European seafood business, and increased G&A, primarily for employee-related costs, litigation costs and professional fees tied to various projects across Europe. Asia Pacific Sales in Asia Pacific increased 7.3%. Volume increased sales by a solid 5.5%, reflecting strong volume in China, Australia and New Zealand. These increases were partially offset by the discontinuation of an Indonesian energy drink and declines in the Tegel(R) poultry business in New Zealand.
4 Heinz sales in New Zealand and in Australia grew by double digits, behind several successful new product offerings. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 4.4%. Lower pricing reduced sales 3.4%, primarily due to market price pressures on the Tegel(R) poultry business in New Zealand. The acquisition of a controlling interest in Shanghai LongFong Foods, a maker of popular frozen Chinese snacks and desserts, increased sales 3.4%, which was essentially offset by the divestiture of a Korean oils and fats product line which reduced sales 2.6%. This is in line with the Company's strategy to improve its mix and focus on core businesses while minimizing net out-of-pocket acquisition costs. Operating income decreased 4.2%, to $32.6 million, primarily due to lower pricing, increased commodity costs, and a decline in profitability in our Tegel(R) poultry business. YEAR-TO-DATE HIGHLIGHTS (for continuing operations, excluding special items) Heinz reported income from continuing operations of $604.5 million in the nine months ended January 26, 2005, up 5.4% compared to income from continuing operations of $573.5 million for the year-earlier period. Diluted earnings per share were $1.71 for the period, a 5.6% increase over $1.62 from continuing operations in the prior year. Sales increased 6.3% for the nine-month period, driven by volume increases of 2.1%, which exceeds the Company's 1-2% annual volume growth target, and exchange translation rates of 4.2%. The favorable volume reflects good results across the Company, most notably in the North American Consumer Products and U.S. Foodservice segments. Sales were moderately impacted by lower pricing of 0.5%. These price reductions were partially offset by net price gains across North America and U.S. Foodservice. The Gross Profit Margin was 36.5%, down 90 basis points versus the prior year, mainly due to increased commodity costs, lower pricing in Italy, and increased supply chain costs in the European seafood business. Operating income decreased $21.5 million, or 2.1%, reflecting the lower gross margin and higher SG&A costs. Operating free cash flow was $375 million versus $697 million in Fiscal 2004. The reduction reflects a $125 million tax pre-payment in Europe. Progress in the Cash Conversion Cycle produced an eight-day improvement versus year ago. For the full year, operating free cash flow is expected to be in the $750 to $850 million range. # #
