Exhibit 99 HEINZ WORLD HEADQUARTERS "THE GOOD FOOD COMPANY" FOR RELEASE UPON RECEIPT HEINZ BOARD INCREASES QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND BY 5.3%, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED PITTSBURGH, MAY 18, 2005 - The H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) announced today that its Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends on both common and preferred stock. The common stock dividend will be raised by 5.3% (from 28.5 cents to 30.0 cents per quarter), for all shareholders of record as of June 24, payable July 10. This increase was previously discussed with investors on February 28, during the company's third-quarter conference call. "This increase reflects the health of our core business, both in the U.S. and abroad and our strong cash performance. It also represents our commitment to return 45 to 50% of earnings to shareholders in the form of a dividend. This increase puts the Heinz common stock dividend in the upper end of that payout range," explained William R. Johnson, Heinz chairman, president and CEO. Based on yesterday's closing price of Heinz stock of $37.18, the new dividend yield would be approximately 3.2%, ranking Heinz in the top 20% of the S&P 500. The Board also declared a dividend of 42.5 cents per share on the company's Third Cumulative Preferred Stock, $1.70 First Series, payable July 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 24, 2005. ## H.J.
