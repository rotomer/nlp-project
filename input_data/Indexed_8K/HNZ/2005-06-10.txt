ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION TO BE EARNED IN FISCAL YEAR 2006 On June 8, 2005, the Management Development & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of H.J. Heinz Company (the "Company") approved the following performance goals for the Company's annual incentive plans. ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUSES. The metrics that will be used to determine any annual bonus awards in Fiscal Year 2006 include operating income, operating free cash flow, and net sales growth, as well as personal goals specific to each participant, as established by the Committee. Awards are payable in cash, if earned, and, with respect to Covered Employees as defined in Section 162(m)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), are intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. The maximum amounts for the Fiscal Year 2006 awards will be determined based upon a performance incentive pool equal to 1.5% of the Company's net income from continuing operations adjusted to eliminate the after-tax effects of any restructuring charges, extraordinary items, and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, each as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. At the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2006, the Committee shall determine the final amount of any award with respect to each participant, which may range from zero to an amount not exceeding the maximum percentage specified for such participant. The performance incentive pool awards will be calculated and divided among the Covered Employees, and the maximum award for any one participant shall not exceed 40% of the pool. The maximum award for the CEO shall not exceed 40% and 15% for each of the other Covered Employees.
