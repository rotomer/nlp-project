EXHIBIT 99 NEWS RELEASE (HEINZ LOGO) WORLD HEADQUARTERS "THE GOOD FOOD COMPANY" FOR RELEASE UPON RECEIPT HEINZ ACQUIRES LEADING SAUCE BRANDS, INCLUDING LEA & PERRINS(R), FROM GROUPE DANONE FOR US$820 MILLION; TRANSACTION ACCELERATES GROWTH IN GLOBAL CONDIMENTS AND SAUCES ALSO GIVES HEINZ HP(R) SAUCES AND PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR AMOY(R) SAUCES IN EUROPE PITTSBURGH, PA, AUGUST 16 - H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today announced that it has successfully completed its acquisition of the HP Foods Group from Groupe Danone S.A. for Pound Sterling 470 million (approximately US$820 million) in cash. The transaction includes leading culinary brands such as Lea & Perrins(R), the world's number-one Worcestershire Sauce, HP(R) sauces and a perpetual license to market the rapidly growing Amoy(R) Asian sauces brands in Europe. This acquisition enhances and expands Heinz's global condiment and sauces business by adding popular brands. Last year, the HP Foods Group had worldwide annual sales of approximately $300 million. Heinz and Groupe Danone announced their definitive agreement on June 20, 2005. The three larger brands included in the transaction are marketed primarily in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, where the transaction instantly elevates Heinz to one of the leading marketers of sauces in the U.K. The transaction includes three factories, two in the U.K. and one at Fair Lawn, New Jersey, which together with its Head Office in London employ a total of approximately 400 people. Heinz will not make any decisions regarding the future of the HP Foods facilities until it completes a comprehensive review in several months. H.J. Heinz Company, P.O. Box 57, Pittsburgh 15230-0057
Heinz Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer William R. Johnson said: "The addition of Lea & Perrins(R), HP(R) sauces and Amoy(R) Asian sauces complements Heinz's leadership in our core condiments and sauces businesses, especially in Europe and North America. This transaction is perfectly aligned with our strategy to focus on quality brands in three core businesses: Ketchup, Condiments and Sauces; Meals & Snacks; and Infant Nutrition." Johnson said he believes the transaction is a "win-win" for consumers and Heinz, the world's leading manufacturer of ketchup. "The name Heinz is synonymous with great-tasting condiments and sauces. The brands we have acquired from Groupe Danone are also very popular with consumers and represent a great fit with our product portfolio." Heinz today reiterated that it expects the transaction to be accretive to the Company's earnings in Fiscal Year 2007, which begins on May 4, 2006. Johnson said that Heinz aims to expand global sales of the HP(R), Lea & Perrins(R) and Amoy(R) brands by leveraging the company's global retail and foodservice distribution and marketing capabilities. Heinz was advised on the transaction by UBS LLC and Clifford Chance LLP. 2
HP(R) AND LEA & PERRINS(R) BRANDS The Lea & Perrins(R) brand is the world's number-one Worcestershire Sauce and the leading brand in the United States, Canada and the U.K. The HP(R) brand of savory sauce is a favorite in both Canada and the U.K. The HP(R) name (which stands for Houses of Parliament) has long been one of Britain's most popular savory table sauces. Lea & Perrins(R) is truly an historic global brand. The famous Worcestershire Sauce has literally traversed the globe since 1837 when it was served on the tables of ocean liners that travelled in and out of British waters. Today, the Lea & Perrins(R) and HP(R) brand sauces maintain their acclaim and are regularly featured as essential ingredients in contemporary recipes created by celebrity chefs. AMOY(R) SAUCE The Amoy(R) brand of Asian varieties is popular in more than 40 countries. The line, which was first created in China in 1908, continues to expand and includes ever-popular soy and stir-fry sauces and noodles. ## 3
