GENERAL ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated August 22, 2005 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items include, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2006, a reorganization charge for severance and employee benefit costs consistent with the Company's goals to streamline its businesses. Additionally, costs were incurred in the first quarter of Fiscal 2006, as a result of the previously announced strategic review related to the potential divestiture of several non-core businesses. Operating segment income and net income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believe are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow as defined below. This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, and management believes this measure provides clarity in understanding the trends of the business. Management, and investors, can benefit from the use of the operating free cash flow measure as it provides cash flow derived from product sales and the short-term application of cash, including the effect of capital expenditures. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures that is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. Disclosed on Exhibit 99 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the first quarters of Fiscal Years 2006 and 2005.

Exhibit 99 NEWS RELEASE HEINZ WORLD HEADQUARTERS "THE GOOD FOOD COMPANY" FOR RELEASE UPON RECEIPT HEINZ REPORTS STRONG FIRST QUARTER TOP-LINE GROWTH OF 5.3% AND EPS OF $0.52 (EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS) o INCREASED VOLUME REFLECTS EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE IN NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS (UP 11.3%), ASIA PACIFIC AND THE ITALIAN INFANT NUTRITION BUSINESSES, WITH OVERALL COMPANY VOLUME UP 2.3% FOR THE QUARTER. o EPS ON A REPORTED BASIS WAS $0.45 VERSUS $0.55 LAST YEAR. o SPECIAL ITEMS OF $0.07 FOR THE QUARTER REFLECT PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REORGANIZATION CHARGES AND OTHER COSTS RELATED TO BUSINESS UNITS BEING REVIEWED FOR POTENTIAL SALE. o RESULTS WERE AIDED BY AN IMPROVED INCOME TAX RATE. PITTSBURGH - AUGUST 22, 2005 - H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today announced strong sales increases of 5.3% for the first quarter of Fiscal 2006, led by an 11.3% volume increase in its North American Consumer Products segment. This volume increase was driven by success across all major brands in North America, including Heinz(R), TGI Friday's(R), Poppers(R), Classico(R), SmartOnes(R) and Ore- Ida(R). Overall, the Company reported net income of $157.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for its first quarter ended July 27, 2005. Excluding special items, the first quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.52 versus earnings of $0.55 per share in the prior year. Special items in the first quarter of Fiscal 2006 totaled $33.8 million pretax ($24.5 million after tax) and related to previously announced reorganization charges for targeted workforce reductions at various worldwide locations as well as costs incurred in connection with strategic reviews related to the potential divestiture of several non-core businesses. The Company expects to incur expense totaling approximately $100 million in Fiscal 2006 for reorganization activities and portfolio reviews as well as costs to integrate acquisitions. Commenting on the Company's performance, Heinz's Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "Fiscal 2006 is off to a solid start, in line with our expectations. We drove strong double-digit sales increases in our North American Consumer Products segment and a nearly 10% increase in sales in our Asia Pacific operations. I am also pleased with the recent turnaround in our Italian infant nutrition business. Additionally, we continued our strong management of working capital, reducing our overall cash conversion cycle by 3 days." H.J. Heinz Company, P.O. Box 57, Pittsburgh 15230-0057
"We are still tracking to our full-year outlook despite increased commodity cost pressures and a stronger U.S. dollar. We expect operating profit to strengthen through the balance of the year. As previously announced, we are conducting a strategic review of our international portfolio and our global organization structure. We are making good progress and expect to become an even more focused company providing enhanced shareholder return," he said. (Comments on the first quarter that follow refer to results excluding special items. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to gauge business performance, and believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they provide management with a view of the business excluding special items.) Overall, Heinz's first quarter sales increased 5.3%, reflecting improvements in all sales measures. Volume increased 2.3%, driven primarily by the North American Consumer Products segment, as well as Heinz Australia and the Italian infant nutrition business. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in our non-core European frozen food and seafood businesses. Pricing increased sales by 0.2%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, drove 1.4 points of sales growth primarily reflecting the addition of Appetizers And, Inc. ("AAI"), a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, frozen hors d'oeuvres sold primarily in the U.S. foodservice industry; and Petrosoyuz, a leading Russian maker of ketchup, condiments and sauces. Foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 1.5%. Gross profit increased 2.3%, despite a 110 basis point decline in gross profit margin, primarily as a result of higher volume and favorable exchange translation rates. The decrease in the gross profit margin is mainly due to the European segment, particularly the U.K., European seafood and the Netherlands businesses. Operating income decreased 7.2%, due to the gross profit margin decline and increased Selling, General and Administrative expenses ("SG&A"). The operating income decline and higher net interest expense was partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, resulting in the 5.5% decline in EPS. Heinz's working capital management showed continued improvement over the prior year, as the Cash Conversion Cycle for the quarter improved three days. The Company generated $119 million of Operating Free Cash Flow in the first quarter of Fiscal 2006, slightly better than expected. After the close of the quarter, on August 16, 2005, the Company acquired HP Foods Limited, HP Foods Holdings Limited, and HP Foods International Limited, collectively referred to as "HPF," from Groupe Danone S.A. HPF is a manufacturer and marketer of sauces which are primarily sold in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. Heinz acquired HPF's brands, including HP(R) and Lea & Perrins(R), and a perpetual license to market Amoy(R) Asian sauces and products in Europe. 2
FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased significantly, up 11.5%, driven by volume growth of 11.3%. Much of the growth relates to successful marketing initiatives for Heinz(R) Ketchup and the TGI Friday's(R) and Poppers(R) brands of frozen snacks. Heinz(R) Ketchup's market share increased to 61.8% in the U.S. and 79.9% in Canada. Volume was also aided by growth in Classico(R) pasta sauces and SmartOnes(R) frozen entrees and the launch of a larger size of Picnic Pak(R) condiments. Frozen potatoes continued to perform well, as a result of last calendar year's popular debut of Ore-Ida(R) Extra Crispy Fries and microwavable Easy Fries(R). Pricing decreased 1.0%, largely due to increased trade promotion expense and decreased price on the larger size Picnic Pak(R). These price decreases were partially offset by reduced trade spending on Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes. Divestitures lowered sales 0.4%; Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 1.7%. Operating income increased 13.2%, driven primarily by higher volume and partially offset by increased G&A and marketing expenses. HEINZ U.S. FOODSERVICE Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased 2.7%. The acquisition of AAI in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 increased sales 3.6%. Average net pricing increased by 0.5%, volume/mix decreased sales 1.3%, largely reflecting an unfavorable mix in single-serve condiments, and ketchup, chiefly due to the timing of promotions. Volume increased in frozen soup. Operating income decreased 4.7% as favorable pricing and the impact of the AAI acquisition was more than offset by higher selling and distribution expenses, largely due to higher fuel, trucking charges and increased personnel costs. EUROPE Heinz Europe's sales were virtually flat for the quarter. Volume/mix decreased 3.0%, principally due to the performance of the non-core frozen foods business in the U.K. and declines in the European seafood business, as well as softness in soup in the U.K. These volume declines were partially offset by increases in the Italian infant nutrition business and Heinz(R) Top-Down Ketchup. Heinz (R) Ketchup now holds nearly 79% market share in the U.K. Heinz's recent acquisition of Petrosoyuz increased sales 2.5%. Petrosoyuz is a leading Russian maker of ketchup, condiments and sauces. Divestitures reduced sales 1.1%; favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 0.5%. As expected, operating income in Europe was off 15.8% for the quarter primarily due to the U.K. and Northern Europe. G&A also increased largely due to employee-related and SAP system implementation costs. 3
ASIA PACIFIC Sales in Asia Pacific increased 9.9%. Volume increased sales 4.7%, reflecting strong performances in Australia and Indonesia, largely due to new product introductions and increased marketing. The volume increases were partially offset by continued declines in the non-core Tegel(R) poultry business in New Zealand. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 6.4%. Lower pricing reduced sales 2.0%, primarily due to continuing market price pressures on Tegel(R) and greater promotional spending in Australia. Heinz Australia led the company in market share gain with a 5+ point increase in ketchup market share, which now is 77%. For the first time in more than a decade, Heinz Australia became the market leader in soup with market share approaching 48%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 0.7%, largely due to the acquisition of Shanghai LongFong Foods, a maker of popular frozen Chinese snacks and desserts. Operating income decreased $5.0 million, primarily due to lower pricing, greater commodity costs and unfavorable sales mix in China, and the profit downturn in the Tegel(R) poultry business. The operating income decline was partially offset by improvements in Australia and in Wattie's of New Zealand. INCOME TAXES The consolidated income tax rate, excluding special items, was 27.9% for the quarter, down 4.1 points versus the first quarter of Fiscal 2005. The reduction is attributable to increased foreign tax credit carryforwards, partially offset by the expiration of certain tax benefits. The full year Fiscal 2006 effective tax rate, excluding special items, is anticipated to be approximately 31% to 33%.
