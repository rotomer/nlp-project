GENERAL ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated November 22, 2005 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items include, in the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2006, a reorganization charge for targeted workforce reductions consistent with the Company's goals to streamline its businesses. Additionally, costs were incurred in the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2006, as a result of the previously announced strategic review related to the potential divestiture of several non-core businesses. Finally, the Company recognized a net charge in the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2006, primarily related to the sale of a seafood business in Israel, which closed early in the third quarter. Operating segment income and net income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believe are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow as defined below. This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, and management believes this measure provides clarity in understanding the trends of the business. Management, and investors, can benefit from the use of the operating free cash flow measure as it provides cash flow derived from product sales and the short-term application of cash, including the effect of capital expenditures. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures that is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. Disclosed on Exhibit 99 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the second quarters and first six months of Fiscal Years 2006 and 2005.

PITTSBURGH - NOVEMBER 22, 2005 - H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today reported net income of $203.8 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for its second quarter ended October 26, 2005. This represents a 7.1% increase in EPS versus the second quarter of Fiscal 2005 on a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and total company basis. Net income from discontinued operations for the second quarter of Fiscal 2006 was $32.0 million ($0.09 of EPS), reflecting the resolution of tax liabilities related to the businesses spun-off to Del Monte in Fiscal 2003. The second quarter net income from continuing operations, excluding special items, was $212.0 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, a 10.7% increase over earnings of $0.56 in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations was $171.8 million, compared to $197.3 million in the prior year. Special items in the second quarter of Fiscal 2006 totaled $50.9 million pretax ($40.2 million after tax) and related to previously announced reorganization charges for targeted workforce reductions at various worldwide locations, as well as costs incurred in connection with strategic reviews related to the potential divestiture of several non-core businesses. The special items include a charge recognized by the Company related to the sale of Star-Kist Food D'Or in Israel, which had been anticipated during the quarter and occurred subsequently.

2 is still projecting to incur net expenses totaling approximately $100 million in Fiscal 2006 for reorganization activities, portfolio reviews and costs to integrate acquisitions. Commenting on the Company's performance, Heinz's Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "We are generally pleased with results for the quarter. Volume, operating income and operating free cash flow, all showed solid progress. We achieved these results despite significant cost headwinds and during a period of extensive efforts to reshape the portfolio and streamline our core businesses. We are making good progress on our potential divestitures and will carefully assess offers to ensure good value for our shareholders." (Comments on the second quarter and six months that follow refer to results excluding special items. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they provide management with a view of the business excluding special items.) SECOND QUARTER SUMMARY Overall, Heinz's second quarter sales increased 6.3%, reflecting improvements in all sales measures. Volume increased 0.6%, driven primarily by the North American Consumer Products segment, as well as the Australian and Indonesian businesses. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in the European frozen food and convenience meals businesses, the Tegel(R) poultry business in New Zealand and the U.S. Foodservice segment. Pricing and foreign exchange increased sales slightly, both by 0.2%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 5.4%, and consisted primarily of the following: - HP Foods Limited, HP Foods Holdings Limited, and HP Foods International Limited, collectively referred to as "HPF", a manufacturer and marketer of sauces that are primarily sold in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada; - Nancy's Specialty Foods, Inc., a producer of premium appetizers, quiche entrees and desserts in the United States and Canada; - A majority interest in Petrosoyuz, a leading Russian maker of ketchup, condiments and sauces; and, - Appetizers And, Inc. ("AAI"), a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, frozen hors d'oeuvres sold primarily in the U.S. foodservice industry.
3 Adjusted gross profit increased 5.6%, due primarily to the increased volume and favorable impact of acquisitions. Adjusted gross profit margins were off slightly, as a modest increase in net price and strong productivity initiatives largely offset increases in commodity and fuel costs. Adjusted operating income grew 5.2% despite the significant cost headwinds buffeting the industry. The increase in adjusted operating income and a lower effective tax rate offset increased net interest expense, resulting in the 10.7% increase in EPS. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.8% versus 32.0% in the prior year. This decline is primarily due to the reversal of a tax provision of $23.4 million related to a foreign affiliate as a result of a favorable court decision involving an unrelated party. As a result of this favorable outcome and other tax initiatives, the Company has revised its projected tax rate for the year from a range of 31% - 33% to 30% - 31%. Heinz's working capital management improved over the prior year and the Cash Conversion Cycle improved by one day. The Company generated $175 million of Operating Free Cash Flow in the second quarter of Fiscal 2006, a 17.4% improvement over last year. SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 10.4%. Volume increased 4.2%, as a result of strong growth in Smart Ones(R) frozen entrees and desserts, TGI Friday's(R) and Delimex(R) brands of frozen snacks and Classico(R) pasta sauces. Frozen potatoes volume also improved. Pricing increased 0.7% largely due to reduced trade promotion expense, primarily in the frozen food category. The HPF and Nancy's acquisitions increased sales 4.1% and exchange translation rates increased sales 1.4%. Adjusted operating income increased 9.3%, driven primarily by the favorable impact of volume growth and acquisitions, partially offset by increased commodity costs and Selling and Distribution expenses ("S&D"). HEINZ U.S. FOODSERVICE Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased 1.5%. The acquisition of AAI in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 increased sales 4.6%. Lower volume in the base business decreased sales 2.5%, largely due to the timing of trade promotions on ketchup and reduced traffic at some key customers. Adjusted operating income decreased 9.4% primarily due to the volume decline, higher commodity costs and increased S&D expense, partially offset by the favorable impact of the AAI acquisition.
4 EUROPE Heinz Europe's sales increased 5.4%. The HPF and Petrosoyuz acquisitions increased sales 9.7%. Volume decreased 2.0% but would have been flat without the impact of the non-core frozen, seafood and HAK(R) businesses targeted for divestiture. Lower pricing decreased sales 0.5%, driven primarily by increased promotional spending on Heinz(R) soup in the U.K., partially offset by improvements in the Italian infant nutrition business and price increases on Heinz(R) beans. Divestitures reduced sales 1.0%, and unfavorable exchange translation rates decreased sales by 0.8%. Adjusted operating income increased 8.6%, driven mainly by the favorable impact of the HPF acquisition, the settlement of a supplier claim in the U.K. related to the Sudan 1 recall, improved performance in European seafood and reduced European headquarter costs. These increases were partially offset by lower volume and higher manufacturing costs in Northern Europe and Italy. ASIA PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased 7.1%. Volume increased sales 3.9%, reflecting strong results in Australia and Indonesia, largely due to new product introductions and increased promotions. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the Tegel(R) poultry business in New Zealand. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 1.6%. Pricing also increased sales slightly, up 0.4%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 1.2%, largely due to the acquisition of Shanghai LongFong Foods, a maker of popular frozen Chinese snacks and desserts. Adjusted operating income was virtually flat, due primarily to commodity and manufacturing cost increases in Indonesia and China, and lower sales in the Tegel(R) poultry business, partially offset by volume improvements and the LongFong acquisition. REST OF WORLD Strong top line growth was generated in Heinz's ROW segment. Heinz India showed both double-digit sales and profit growth for the quarter. Other markets posting strong growth were South Africa, Egypt and Mexico, where the new single-serve foodservice acquisition is doing quite well. YEAR-TO-DATE HIGHLIGHTS Heinz reported income from continuing operations, excluding special items, of $393.7 million in the six months ended October 26, 2005, up 0.4% compared to income from continuing operations of $392.1 million for the year-earlier period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding special items, was $1.14, a 2.7% increase over $1.11 in the prior year.
5 Sales increased 5.9% for the first half of Fiscal 2006, driven by volume increases of 1.4% and acquisitions, net of divestitures, of 3.4%. The favorable volume was due primarily to the North American Consumer Products segment, as well as the Australian, Eastern European, Indonesian, Indian and Italian infant nutrition businesses. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in European frozen food, convenience meals and seafood, U.S. Foodservice segment and Tegel(R) poultry. Gross profit increased 4.0%, despite a 60 basis point decline in adjusted gross profit margin, primarily from the favorable impact of acquisitions, higher volume and favorable exchange translation rates. Adjusted operating income declined 1.0%, largely due to the lower gross profit margin, higher fuel and transportation costs and increased G&A expense. On a GAAP basis, net income for the six months was $361.1 million compared to $393.8 million in the prior year, and EPS was $1.04 compared to $1.11 in the prior year. The current year includes charges for special items of $84.8 million pretax ($64.6 million after tax) and income of $32.0 million related to discontinued operations.
