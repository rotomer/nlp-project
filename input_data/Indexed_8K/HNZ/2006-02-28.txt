GENERAL ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated February 28, 2006 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items include, in the third quarter and nine months ended January 25, 2006, costs for downsizing, integration, separation and preparation for sale, net losses on dispositions and impairments in anticipation of potential sales. For the third quarter and nine months ended January 26, 2005, these special items include non-cash asset impairment charges for cost and equity investments. Operating segment income and net income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believe are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow as defined below. This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, and management believes this measure provides clarity in understanding the trends of the business. Management, and investors, can benefit from the use of the operating free cash flow measure as it provides cash flow derived from product sales and the short-term application of cash, including the effect of capital expenditures. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures that is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. Disclosed on Exhibit 99 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the third quarters and first nine months of Fiscal Years 2006 and 2005.

Exhibit 99 Heinz Reports Significant Progress on Its Strategy for Growth And an Increase in Operating Income, Excluding Special Items, of 8.1% for the Third Quarter PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 28, 2006--H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) -- Total sales increased 5.7% (9.4% on a constant currency basis). Heinz's top 10 brands grew 4.4% in constant currency, led by double-digit growth in Smart Ones(R), Classico(R) and TGI Friday's(R). -- Volume/mix grew 2.9%, with every operating segment delivering increased volume. -- Definitive agreements to sell both the European Seafood and Tegel(R) poultry businesses were executed. -- Progress was also made toward the potential sale of other non-core assets. Additionally, the Company sold its investment in The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. and the HAK(R) vegetable line in Northern Europe. Plans were also finalized regarding the repatriation of dividends under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). -- Special items were $0.10 for continuing operations and $0.08 for discontinued operations. Including these special items, operating income for continuing operations was down 3.7% for the quarter. -- EPS for continuing operations was $0.39 versus $0.37 in the prior year and, excluding special items, was $0.50 versus $0.58 in the prior year, reflecting increased interest expense and a higher tax rate. On a total-company GAAP basis, EPS was $0.35 versus $0.43 last year. -- The Company also reconfirms its pro-forma EPS expectations for fiscal 2006 and 2007. Pro-forma EPS is expected to be $2.10 to $2.16 for the current fiscal year, with 6 to 8% growth off this base in fiscal 2007. H.J.Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today reported strong operating results and significant progress on its strategy for growth during the third quarter that ended January 25, 2006. Net income for the quarter, on a total-company GAAP basis, was $116.6 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, versus $152.4 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, last year. In continuing operations, sales increased by 5.7% (9.4% on a constant currency basis) for the quarter, driven by an increase of 2.9% in volume/mix and an increase due to acquisitions, net of divestitures, of 6.6%. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 3.7%. Operating Free Cash Flow for the quarter was $58 million, despite the impact of spending for special items. Excluding the impact of special items, Operating Free Cash Flow would have been up over 30% from the same period last year. EPS from continuing operations increased 5%, to $0.39 from $0.37 last year. EPS from continuing operations, excluding special items, decreased by $0.08 to $0.50 due to higher interest costs and a significantly higher tax rate during the quarter. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the operating results related to the European Seafood and the Tegel(R) poultry businesses have been included in discontinued operations in the company's consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. In addition, net income from discontinued operations includes amounts related to the favorable settlement of tax liabilities associated with the businesses spun-off to Del Monte in fiscal 2003. Total net loss from discontinued operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was $16.6 million ($0.05 EPS). Commenting on the Company's progress, Heinz's Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "I am very pleased with the progress we made during the quarter. Heinz set a very ambitious agenda this year as part of its strategy for growth to further focus this Company on its core categories and geographies, reduce management layers and overhead, and position the Company for more consistent growth in its big brands. The team made major strides toward this goal during the quarter. Additionally, we posted solid results for the quarter, with volume growth of almost 3%, operating income growth of more than 8% (excluding special items) and solid Operating Free Cash Flow of $58 million. Our top 10 brands, representing nearly 60% of total sales, grew 4.4%, on a constant currency basis, led by double-digit growth in Smart Ones(R), Classico(R) and TGI Friday's(R). Consequently, we believe that we are on-track to deliver the post-divestiture, pro-forma EPS projections of $2.10 to $2.16 for this year that we outlined last September." Special items in the third quarter for downsizing, integration, separation and preparation for sale totaled $22.0 million pre-tax in continuing operations and $5.9 million pre-tax in discontinued operations. Additionally, the net loss on dispositions and impairments in anticipation of potential sales, were $19.5 million pre-tax for continuing operations. During the third quarter, significant progress was made on Heinz's strategy for growth (outlined in September 2005) to drive consistent annual sales growth of 3% to 4% and profits of 6% to 8%. The goals of this strategy are to focus on three core categories, to innovate in Heinz's top ten brands, to reduce supply chain costs, and to use cash to drive shareholder value. The following milestones were reached: -- The signing of definitive agreements to sell the European Seafood business to Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking for EUR 425 million (approx. US$500 million) and to sell the Tegel(R) poultry business to Pacific Equity Partners for NZ$ 250 million (approximately US$165 million). The sale processes for European Seafood and Tegel businesses could both close around the end of March. -- The U.K. Competition Commission approved our request to complete the sale of the Ethnic portion of the recently acquired HP/Lea & Perrins business. The business has been sold to Associated British Foods for approximately $47 million and the deal closed this morning. -- Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company received provisional clearance from the U.K. Competition Commission for Heinz's purchase of the HP/LP business in the U.K. A final decision from the commission is expected by mid-April. -- Completed the sale of the HAK vegetable line in Northern Europe for $51 million. -- The registration and sale of the Company's common stock interest in The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. for $116 million. -- Plans were finalized to repatriate $800 million of additional foreign dividends during the fourth quarter, which required an incremental tax accrual during the third quarter of approximately $24 million. The Company continues to explore the potential sale of other non-core businesses and is currently exploring ways to maximize shareholder value in its European frozen foods business. Importantly, Heinz is on-track to achieve, by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the approximately $1 billion in disposition proceeds as outlined in September. (Comments on the third quarter and nine months that follow refer to certain financial measures that are adjusted to exclude special items. In addition, management refers to Operating Free Cash Flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures and the Operating Free Cash Flow presentation provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they provide management with a view of the continuing business excluding special items.) THIRD QUARTER SUMMARY Overall, Heinz's third quarter sales increased 5.7% (9.4% on a constant currency basis). Volume increased 2.9%, driven primarily by good results in the North American Consumer Products segment, as well as the Australian and U.K. businesses. Every operating segment achieved year-on-year volume growth. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in the European Frozen Food and the Italian infant nutrition businesses. Net pricing was virtually flat, and foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 3.7%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 6.6%, and consisted primarily of the acquisition of HP Foods ("HPF"), Nancy's Specialty Foods, Inc., Petrosoyuz, and Appetizers And, Inc. ("AAI"). Adjusted gross profit increased 1.7%, due primarily to the favorable impact of acquisitions and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates. Adjusted gross profit margin was 36.5%, a decline from 37.9% in the prior year, largely due to increased commodity costs, particularly in the U.S. and Indonesian businesses. Adjusted operating income grew 8.1%, as the adjusted gross profit increase combined with reduced General & Administrative expenses ("G&A") to offset increased fuel and transportation costs, particularly in the U.S. businesses. The increase in adjusted operating income was offset by increased net interest expense and a higher effective tax rate, resulting in the 13.8% decrease in EPS. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.5% versus 22.3% in the prior year. The Company reaffirms its projected effective tax rate for the full fiscal year, excluding special items, of 30% to 31%. Heinz's working capital management improved over the prior year, as the Cash Conversion Cycle continued its improvement for the quarter by improving by two days, on a total company basis. THIRD QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 13.8%. Volume increased 4.9%, as a result of strong growth in Smart Ones(R) frozen entrees and desserts, TGI Friday's(R) and Delimex(R) brands of frozen snacks, Classico(R) pasta sauces and Heinz(R) Ketchup. Overall, pricing increased 1.5%, largely due to more efficient trade spending on SmartOnes(R) frozen entrees and Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes. The acquisitions of HP Foods and Nancy's acquisitions increased sales 6.6%, and exchange translation rates increased sales 0.7%. During the third quarter, Heinz Canada's Classico(R) sauce market share improved 2.4 points to 41.5%. Heinz(R) Ketchup in the U.S. grew 1.7 market share points. Heinz Consumer Products launched several new Smart Ones(R) varieties that address the growing Asian and Mexican segments. These latest offerings include Southwest Style Adobo Chicken, Chicken Enchiladas Monterey, Grilled Mandarin Chicken and Dragon Shrimp LoMein. The TGI Friday's(R) range grew with Spicy Thai Egg Rolls and Onion Rings. Likewise, the popular Ore-Ida(R) brand added Easy Breakfast Potatoes. In the pipeline is a new Fridge Door Fit(R) Ketchup bottle, an easier-to-handle pack designed to fit into refrigerator door compartments. Available in both 46- and 64-ounce sizes, this new innovation offers consumers large-size convenience with less packaging. Fridge Door Fit(R) Ketchup is expected to be available this spring. Adjusted operating income increased 4.1%, driven primarily by the favorable impact of acquisitions, volume growth and increased net pricing, partially offset by increased commodity and fuel costs and increased G&A. HEINZ U.S. FOODSERVICE Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased 7.0%. The acquisition of AAI increased sales 5.2%. Volume increased 1.3%, driven by increases in Truesoups frozen soup and single-serve condiments. Higher pricing increased sales by 0.6%. One of the company's most unique foodservice customers, NASA, is expanding the line of Heinz(R) single-serve condiments aboard the International Space Station. Adjusted operating income increased 5.3%, largely due to the favorable impact of the AAI acquisition, and partially offset by higher commodity and fuel costs. EUROPE Heinz Europe's sales increased 1.3%. The acquisitions of HP Foods and Petrosoyuz increased sales 12.0%. Volume increased 2.1%, as increases from Heinz(R) soup and the roll out of new Top-Down ketchup sizes were partially offset by declines in the frozen foods business in the U.K., resulting mainly from category softness, and declines in the Italian infant nutrition business. Lower pricing decreased sales 2.8%, driven primarily by increased promotional spending on Heinz(R) soup in the U.K. and other condiments in Northern Europe. Divestitures reduced sales 1.5%, and unfavorable exchange translation rates decreased sales by 8.5%. Momentum continued in the U.K. and Ireland as third-quarter shipments were the highest in the last three years. Volume for ketchup was up by double-digits, while Heinz(R) Salad Cream rose 5%. Newest introductions include Top Down and Extra Lite varieties of Heinz(R) Salad Cream. Sales of HP Foods brands, HP(R), Lea & Perrins(R) and Amoy(R), were up 5% versus a year ago. Across Europe ketchup volume rose by 14%. Adjusted operating income increased 11.8%, mainly due to the favorable impact of acquisitions, higher volume, reduced marketing expense, and decreased G&A. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable pricing and exchange translation rates. ASIA/PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased 2.0%. Volume increased sales 3.7%, reflecting strong volume in Australia, largely due to new product introductions, partially offset by declines in Indonesian sauces and noodles due to changes in promotional timing. Pricing increased sales 0.5%, resulting largely from price increases on various products in Indonesia. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 1.8%, largely due to the acquisition of Shanghai LongFong Foods. Unfavorable exchange translation rates decreased sales by 4.0%. Innovation continues to drive growth at Heinz Australia, which this quarter launched six Heinz(R) International Ready-to-Serve Soups inspired by global taste trends; Heinz(R) Spaghetti Plus varieties fortified with calcium, fiber, iron and Omega 3; and a collection of premium Heinz(R) SteamFresh frozen meals. Adjusted operating income decreased $8.9 million, chiefly due to increased commodity and manufacturing costs primarily in Indonesia. REST OF WORLD Sales in Heinz's ROW segment decreased 3.3%, as the impact of divestitures and exchange translation rates more than offset the 1.4% volume increase and 6.4% pricing improvements, primarily in Latin America and India. Adjusted operating income increased due mainly to favorable pricing and decreased SG&A. YEAR-TO-DATE HIGHLIGHTS Heinz reported income from continuing operations, excluding special items, of $537.0 million in the nine months ended January 25, 2006, down 5.8% compared to $570.4 million for the year-earlier period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding special items, was $1.56, a 3.1% decrease from $1.61 in the prior year. Sales increased 6.3% (7.2% on a constant currency basis) for the first nine months of Fiscal 2006, driven by volume increases of 2.3% and acquisitions, net of divestitures of 4.8%. The favorable volume was due primarily to the North American Consumer Products segment, as well as the Australian, Indonesian and Italian infant nutrition businesses. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in the European Frozen Food business and the U.S. Foodservice segment. Adjusted gross profit increased 3.3%, despite a 110 basis point decline in adjusted gross profit margin. The gross profit increase was due to the favorable impact of acquisitions and higher sales volume and the decline in adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to higher commodity and fuel costs, particularly in the U.S. businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 2.1%, as the increase in gross profit and decreased G&A in Europe were partially offset by higher fuel and transportation costs, particularly in the U.S. businesses. On a GAAP basis, net income for the nine months was $477.7 million compared to $546.2 million in the prior year, and EPS was $1.39 compared to $1.54 in the prior year. The current year includes income of $36.0 million related to discontinued operations and the prior year includes income of $49.7 million related to discontinued operations. In the current year, charges for special items in continuing operations were $120.4 million pretax ($95.4 million after tax) and in discontinued operations were $31.9 million after tax. The special items related to loss on sale or impairment were $32.2 million pre-tax in continuing operations. In the prior year, charges for special items were $73.8 million both pre- and after-tax, all of which were recorded in continuing operations. OUTLOOK For Fiscal 2007, Heinz is projecting sales growth of 3% to 4%, operating income growth of 6% to 8% and EPS growth also of 6% to 8% from a pro-forma range of $2.10 to $2.16 anticipated for Fiscal 2006.
