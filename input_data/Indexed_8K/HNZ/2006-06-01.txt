GENERAL ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated June 1, 2006 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items include, in the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 3, 2006, costs for downsizing, integration, separation and preparation for sale, net losses on dispositions, impairments in anticipation of potential sales, non-cash asset impairment charges for cost and equity investments, and the impact of the American Jobs Creation Act. For the fiscal year ended April 27, 2005, these special items include non-cash asset impairment charges for cost and equity investments, and an asset impairment charge for the HAK vegetable product line that was recognized during the fourth quarter. Operating segment income and net income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believe are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow as defined below. This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, and management believes this measure provides clarity in understanding the trends of the business. Management, and investors, can benefit from the use of the operating free cash flow measure as it provides cash flow derived from product sales and the short-term application of cash, including the effect of capital expenditures. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures that is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. Disclosed on Exhibit 99.1 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the fourth quarters and year-to-date periods of Fiscal Years 2006 and 2005.

Heinz Company's press release dated June 1, 2006, setting forth its Superior Value and Growth Plan for Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008, furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2.

Exhibit 99.1 Heinz Achieves Fourth-Quarter Sales Growth of 7.6% and Substantially Completes Portfolio Realignment; Fourth-Quarter Operating Income Rose 6.3%, Excluding Special Charges PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 1, 2006--H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ): Fourth Quarter EPS of $0.54 from Continuing Operations, Excluding Special Charges, Exceeded Expectations; Separate Press Release Issued on Superior Value and Growth Plan H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today reported solid financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 3, 2006, with growth in sales and operating income. Commenting on the Company's performance in Fiscal Year 2006, Heinz Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "In Fiscal Year 2006, Heinz generated strong sales growth, operating profit and cash flow. Our achievements in the fourth quarter of FY 2006 included sales growth of 7.6%, led by double-digit growth in Smart Ones(R) nutritional meals, Classico(R) premium pasta sauces and Ore-Ida(R) potatoes, and a 6.3% increase in operating income, excluding special charges, reflecting strong volume across all segments and recent acquisitions." Mr. Johnson continued, "We have good momentum going into Fiscal Year 2007 as we execute our plan to deliver superior value and growth." (See separate Heinz news release today on Superior Value and Growth Plan or visit www.heinzsuperiorvalue.com). Reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures are set forth in the attached tables. FOURTH-QUARTER SUMMARY -- For the fourth quarter of FY 2006, EPS for continuing operations, excluding special items, was $0.54 versus $0.59 in the prior year, exceeding previous estimates. The results in FY 2006 reflected increased interest costs and a substantially higher quarterly tax rate compared to last year. -- Net income for the fourth quarter, on a total company, GAAP basis, was $167.9 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, versus $206.5 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, last year. Net income reflected the impact of special items including a write-down of the company's Zimbabwe operations and a gain related to the sales of certain businesses (see below). -- Fourth-quarter sales increased 7.6% (10.7% on a constant currency basis) to $2.4 billion. Sales of Heinz's top 10 brands in constant currency grew 7.9%, led by double-digit growth in Smart Ones(R), Classico(R) and Ore-Ida(R) brands. Sales in Australia rose strongly on new product introductions. -- Overall, volume/mix increased 7.8% with every operating segment posting strong growth, aided by an extra week in the fourth quarter. -- Acquisitions, net of divestitures increased sales by 3.4%, while unfavorable exchange reduced sales by 3.1%. -- Special items in the fourth quarter reduced total earnings by a total of $0.05 per share, and included a net gain of $0.48 per share in discontinued operations resulting from the sale of non-core businesses. -- During the fourth quarter, Heinz completed the sales of its European Seafood business, its Tegel(R) poultry business in New Zealand and several other smaller non-core businesses. Heinz also received final regulatory clearance for its acquisition of the HP Foods Group, which strengthened the company's core product line in sauces, including Lea & Perrins(R) Worcestershire sauce. -- Operating Free Cash Flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) for the quarter was a strong $492 million which includes the use of approximately $45 million for special items related to strategic initiatives. Special Items Special items in the fourth quarter for downsizing, integration, separation and preparation for sale of assets totaled $58.7 million pre-tax in continuing operations. Additionally, the net loss on dispositions and impairments in anticipation of potential asset sales was $174.1 million pre-tax for continuing operations and relates primarily to the write-down of the company's operations in Zimbabwe. The decision to write down the Zimbabwe investment relates to management's determination that this investment is not a core business and as a consequence the company will explore strategic options to exit this business. Management's determination is based on a current evaluation of political and economic conditions existing in Zimbabwe and the ability for the company to recover its cost in this investment. This evaluation considered the continued economic turmoil, further instability in the local currency and the uncertainty regarding the ability to source raw material in the future. A pretax gain of $209.1 million was recorded in discontinued operations primarily related to the sales of European Seafood and the Tegel poultry business. Excluding special items, EPS for the fourth quarter from continuing operations, although ahead of market estimates and projections established by the company last September, decreased from FY2005 by $0.05 to $0.54 due to increased interest costs and a significantly higher quarterly tax rate. However, including special items, net income from continuing operations and EPS were completely offset by the special charges, most notably by the Zimbabwe write down. FULL YEAR SUMMARY -- Total sales 6.7% (8.2% on a constant currency basis) to $8.6 billion. Heinz's top 10 brands, in constant currency, grew 4.5% led by double-digit growth in the Smart Ones(R), Classico(R) and TGIF(R) brands. -- Increased volume/mix 3.8% with every operating segment contributing to the increase. -- Increased operating income, excluding special items, by 3.2% over prior year despite significant cost increases for fuel and commodities. -- Improved Cash Conversion Cycle an additional 2 days, to an historic low of 56 days. -- Generated strong operating free cash flow of $844 million, despite spending approximately $75 million for special items related to strategic initiatives. -- Completed the sale of 10 non-core assets resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $857 million. -- Repatriated approximately $1.3 billion in foreign dividends, aided by the American Jobs Creation Act. Net income, on a total company, GAAP basis, was $645.6 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, versus $752.7 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, last year. Volume performance was strong in North America, Australia and in the Italian infant feeding business, partially offset by softness in frozen food category in the U.K. Acquisitions, net of divestitures increased sales another 4.4%. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1.5%. Operating income, excluding special items, increased 3.2%, driven by strong volume and recent acquisitions offset somewhat by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. EPS from continuing operations decreased $0.66 from the prior year. Excluding special items, EPS decreased by $0.11 to $2.10 due to increased interest costs and a higher tax rate despite the increase in operating income excluding special items. Special items for the full year for downsizing, integration, and separation totaled $146.7 million pre-tax in continuing operations and $11.8 million pre-tax in discontinued operations. Additionally, the net loss on dispositions and impairments in anticipation of potential sales was $206.5 million pre-tax for continuing operations and relates mainly to the impairment of the company's operations in Zimbabwe and losses on the exit of several small, non-core product lines and businesses. A pretax gain of $209.1 million was recorded in discontinued operations related primarily to the sales of European Seafood and the Tegel poultry business. (Comments on the financial results that follow refer to adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income, which exclude special items. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they enable investors to use financial measures that management uses in addition to GAAP measures to evaluate the day-to-day operations of the business.) FISCAL 2006 FOURTH QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS Sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.6% (10.7% on a constant currency basis). Volume increased 7.8%, lead by a 10.6% increase in North American Consumer Products and 22.9% in Australia. Pricing decreased sales slightly, as improvements in North America, Latin America and Indonesia were offset primarily by declines in the U.K. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 3.4%. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 3.1%. Adjusted gross profit increased 6.2%, primarily due to higher sales volume and the favorable impact of acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable exchange translation rates. The adjusted gross profit margin decreased 50 basis points to 36.5% mainly due to declines in the Europe segment, particularly in the U.K. behind increased promotional spending, and in addition, increased commodity costs, particularly in the North American and Indonesian businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 6.3%. The increase in adjusted operating income was offset by increased net interest expense and a higher effective tax rate, resulting in the 8.5% decrease in EPS. The adjusted effective tax rate was 37.3% compared to 27.0% for the prior year. QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 16.4%. Volume increased 10.6%, as a result of growth in Smart Ones (R) frozen entrees and desserts, in Ore-Ida (R) frozen potatoes and Heinz(R) Ketchup. The acquisition of HP/Lea & Perrins and Nancy's added an additional 4.1% to sales along with higher pricing of 0.4%. Favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 1.3%. Adjusted operating income increased 19.2%, driven primarily by the volume growth and the favorable impact of acquisitions partially offset by increased SG&A expenses resulting from the increased volume and transportation costs, as well as acquisitions. U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased 6.1%. Volume increased 3.1%, behind increases in Truesoups(R) frozen soup and Heinz (R) Ketchup. Higher pricing increased sales by 0.7% as increases in custom recipe tomato products and single-serve condiments were largely offset by declines in ketchup and soups. The acquisition of Appetizers And, Inc. ("AAI") and Kabobs, Inc. increased sales 2.4%. Adjusted operating income decreased $7.7 million, largely due to higher marketing, commodity, fuel and transportation costs. Europe Heinz Europe's sales increased 2.6%. Volume increased 6.5%, from increases in the U.K. in Heinz (R) soup and top-down ketchup and in the Italian infant nutrition business. The acquisitions of the HP/Lea & Perrins and Petrosoyuz businesses increased sales 9.1%. Lower pricing decreased sales 2.6%. These decreases were partially offset by increased pricing initiated on Heinz (R) beans. Divestitures reduced sales 3.1%, and unfavorable exchange translation rates decreased sales by 7.3%. Adjusted operating income increased 1.2% mainly due to the favorable impact of acquisitions, higher volume and reduced marketing expense. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable pricing, higher G&A expense and exchange translation rates. Asia/Pacific Sales in Asia/Pacific increased 6.7%. Volume increased sales 13.4%, reflecting strong performance in Australia and New Zealand, largely due to new product introductions, and in China and Indonesia. Pricing unfavorably impacted sales by 1.3%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, decreased sales slightly by 0.1%. Unfavorable exchange translation rates decreased sales by 5.4%. Adjusted operating income increased $9.1 million chiefly due to the strong volume performance and reduced G&A expenses. Rest of World In Heinz's ROW segment, sales increased 1.8%. Volume increased 5.3% due primarily to strong sales in Latin America and India. Higher pricing increased sales by 6.4%, largely due to price increases taken in Latin America and India. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales by 7.4%. Unfavorable exchange translation rates decreased sales 2.4%. Adjusted operating income increased $9.0 million due primarily to the increased pricing and volume and decreased G&A principally due to divestitures. FISCAL 2006 FULL YEAR OPERATING RESULTS Sales for Fiscal 2006 increased 6.7%, to $8.6 billion (+8.2% on a constant currency basis). Sales were favorably impacted by increased volume of 3.8% driven primarily by the North American Consumer Products segment, as well as the Australian, Indonesian and the Italian infant nutrition businesses. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in the European frozen food business. Pricing decreased sales slightly, by 0.1%, as improvements in Latin America and Indonesia and North America were offset by declines in Australia, U.K. and Northern Europe. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 4.4%. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 1.5%. Adjusted gross profit increased 4.1%, primarily due to the favorable impact of acquisitions and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable exchange translation rates. The adjusted gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points mainly due to pricing declines in Europe and increased commodity costs, particularly in the North American and Indonesian businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 3.2% as the increase in adjusted gross profit and the decrease in G&A expenses in Europe were partially offset by higher fuel and transportation costs, particularly in the U.S. businesses. The increase in adjusted operating income was offset by increased net interest expense and a higher effective tax rate, resulting in a 5.0% decrease in EPS. The adjusted effective tax rate was 31.4% compared to 28.3% for the prior year. The company's working capital management initiatives improved the Cash Conversion Cycle by an additional two days, on a total company basis. Operating free cash flow was $844 million, despite spending of approximately $75 million for special items related to strategic initiatives.

Exhibit 99.2 Heinz Details Superior Value and Growth Plan for Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008 PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 1, 2006--H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ): -- $355 million in cost reductions -- $145 million in reduced trade spend -- $1 billion in additional share repurchases over FY07 and FY08 -- 16.7 percent increase in dividend to $1.40 per common share -- 10 percent Earnings Per Share growth for FY07 to $2.35 H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson will outline the company's Superior Value and Growth Plan for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, this morning at 8:30 a.m. during its fiscal year 2006 fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference, and later at the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference, both in New York. Mr. Johnson will be joined by Dave Moran, President and CEO of North American Consumer Products; Scott O'Hara, President and CEO of Heinz Europe; and Art Winkleblack, CFO. Speeches and slides will be available live on www.heinz.com and starting at 9:30 a.m. on www.heinzsuperiorvalue.com. During the next two years, Heinz plans to achieve $355 million in cost savings and $145 million in trade spend reduction. The Company is committed to reinvesting a portion of the savings in growing its sharply focused portfolio of leading brands. Specifically, the company expects to realize the following savings in the coming two fiscal years: -- $265 million in cost of goods sold and $90 million in SG&A, totaling $355 million -- Reduction of deals and allowances by nearly $145 million The company will reinvest a significant portion of the productivity savings in sales growth: -- $317 million in marketing and advertising in FY07, an 18.7 percent increase over FY06 -- Launch of more than 100 new products in FY07 -- Double-digit increase in research and development funding in each of the next two years These actions are expected to produce the following financial results: -- EPS growth of 10 percent in FY07 to $2.35 per share and a further 8 percent to $2.54 in FY08. -- Sales growth of 3-4 percent in FY07 and 4 percent or better in FY08. -- Operating income growth of more than 8 percent in FY07. Heinz intends to return nearly $2 billion to shareholders over the next two years as a result of the following: -- A 16.7 percent dividend increase to $1.40 per common share in FY07, from $1.20 per share in FY06, for a payout ratio of approximately 60 percent of expected FY07 EPS, with future increases indexed to expected EPS growth, maintaining a payout ratio of about 60 percent -- $1 billion in share repurchases over the next two years Following a four-year turnaround, Heinz is now a leaner, sharply focused business with some of the world's best brands. The Superior Value and Growth Plan outlined today builds on the progress Heinz has made and has three key objectives: 1) Reduce costs to improve margins 2) Grow the core portfolio 3) Generate cash to deliver superior shareholder value Commenting on the plan, Heinz Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "Our board and management are unified in our focus to deliver superior shareholder value. The Heinz plan sets aggressive but realistic goals for the next two years. We have the right strategy, the right brands and the right people to drive the business forward. We are in fighting shape to deliver high quality earnings growth by relentlessly attacking non-value-added costs and innovating and growing some of the world's best brands." SUPERIOR VALUE AND GROWTH PLAN -- AN OVERVIEW Below are details of the company's three-part strategy to deliver superior value and growth over the next two fiscal years: I. Reduce Costs to Improve Margins: During the past 18 months, Heinz's Board of Directors and management team worked together to craft plans for aggressive cost-cutting, plant closings and employee headcount reductions. During the next two years, Heinz will: -- Drive Efficiency in Trade Spend. During the past three years, Heinz focused its efforts on driving efficiencies and reducing trade spend in its United States Consumer Products Business Unit, resulting in a 430 basis point reduction in trade spend in that unit. During FY07, the company will implement its successful U.S. trade management model in the other major business units. The opportunity is particularly large in Europe, which is expected to provide a significant portion of the $145 million in trade spend reduction Heinz expects over the next two fiscal years. -- Integrate Global Supply Chain. During FY2007 and FY2008, the company plans to continue integrating its $6 billion global supply chain by better leveraging direct and indirect procurement, rationalizing the manufacturing footprint and driving continuous improvement initiatives. The company has identified 15 plants that it intends to exit in fiscal 2007, producing the majority of the company's expected employment reduction in FY07 of approximately 2,700, or approximately 8 percent. Together, these initiatives should result in at least $165 million in cost savings in FY2007. Heinz is evaluating plans to exit up to an additional five plants in FY2008. -- Reduce Selling, General and Administrative Costs. In FY2007, the company expects to generate SG&A savings of $60 million. About $30 million will be sourced from headcount and salary reductions; $20 million from reduced professional fees as a result of our expanded indirect procurement program and $10 million from reduced costs in its U.S. distribution network. The company expects another $30 million in SG&A savings in FY2008. II. Grow the Core Portfolio: During the past four years, the company has improved its portfolio to ensure that it is operating in three value-added core categories and in markets where Heinz has a mix of leading brands, strong profitability and unique capabilities. Three Value-Added Categories The company's three categories, all with strong underlying consumption trends, are: -- Ketchup and Sauces, which leverages clear competitive advantages and Heinz's unparalleled food industry heritage -- Meals and Snacks, which has a portfolio of well-positioned, leading and growing brands, including Ore-Ida(R), Smart Ones(R), Heinz(R), Weight Watchers(R) from Heinz(R) and Wattie's(R), and -- Infant Food, a high-margin business with commanding leadership positions in each of the seven markets where Heinz competes under two strong brands: Plasmon(R) and Heinz(R) Heinz's tighter category focus has resulted in a greater emphasis on developing new products that deliver superior taste, better nutrition and more convenient packaging that appeals to its consumers and their diverse lifestyles. In FY2007, the company expects to launch over 100 new products in all three categories. Some examples include: -- Fridge Door Fit Ketchup -- Ore-Ida(R) Easy Breakfast Potatoes -- New varieties of Classico(R) sauce, including new organic varieties -- New Smart Ones(R) entrees and desserts -- The launch of Smart Ones(R) and TGI Friday's(R) in Canada -- Mean Beanz and international soups in Australia -- New recipe meals for toddlers in the U.K. -- Wattie's(R) Sweet and Sour sauces in New Zealand One innovation that has garnered significant recent attention with tremendous potential in New Zealand and the U.K. is Baked Bean Toasties, a convenient twist on a healthy Heinz-inspired British staple, beans on toast, which seals the beans inside the bread like a toaster pastry. With its legacy of pure food products, Heinz is focused on helping consumers to live healthier lives, while enjoying great-tasting foods. The company now offers a wide range of foods catering to the fast-growing health and wellness trend. These include products that are organic, contain reduced sodium and sugar or provide enhanced functional benefits, such as Heinz(R) Organic and reduced sugar Ketchup, and the entire range of Smart Ones(R) and all-natural Classico(R), and new products such as Heinz(R) Spaghetti Plus with calcium and Omega 3 in Australia, and low sodium beans and soups and multigrain pasta in the U.K. Heinz(R) and Plasmon(R) infant foods also cater to a wide range of infant nutritional, allergenic and digestive concerns. Heinz plans a double-digit increase in investment in research and development in each of the next two years, and is committed to increasing marketing spend by $50 million, or approximately 19 percent, in FY07, as it builds on its strong brand equities and supports the new product launches. Focused Global Markets Together with its sharper portfolio focus, Heinz will devote its energy and resources primarily to its six developed markets of the U.S., Canada, U.K., Italy, Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand and five emerging markets. The developed markets account for half of the $1.5 trillion global packaged food market and generate more than 85 percent of Heinz's sales and approximately 95 percent of economic profit. Heinz's fast-growing emerging markets are Russia, India, China, Indonesia and Poland, which represent over 40 percent of the world's population and 15 percent of the world's GDP growth. Heinz expects to generate one-quarter of its total sales growth in fiscal 2007 from these five markets, which are forecast to grow sales by over 10 percent. In these emerging markets, Heinz has strong local partnerships, and leading brands, such as Picador(R) in Russia, Complan(R) in India, Long Fong(R) in China, ABC(R) in Indonesia and Pudliszki(R) in Poland, as well as the Heinz(R) brand in all of them. Heinz expects double-digit profit margins in FY07 in these markets, where fixed costs are among the lowest in the company. III. Generate Cash to Deliver Superior Shareholder Value: On May 31, 2006, the Heinz Board of Directors approved an increase of $0.20 per share to its annual dividend on the company's 25 cent par value Common Stock. This represents a 16.7 percent increase from $1.20 per share in FY06 to $1.40 per share in FY07, effective with the July 10, 2006 payment of 35 cents per share to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 24, 2006. The payout ratio will increase to approximately 60 percent of projected FY07 EPS, and will be indexed to future EPS growth to maintain a payout of approximately 60 percent. The Heinz Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of 42.5 cents per share on the company's Third Cumulative Preferred Stock, $1.70 First Series, payable July 1, 2006 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 24, 2006. The Board also approved the additional repurchase of $1 billion in shares over FY07 and FY08. Heinz increased operating free cash flow by nearly 2.5 times in the past four years versus the previous four-year period, and achieved the highest cumulative four-year cash flow in company history. Heinz will continue driving cash flow to build shareholder value. In the next two fiscal years, the key sources of cash flow are expected to be faster earnings growth, continued reduction of the cash conversion cycle (CCC) by 2 to 3 days per year, strong discipline on capital spending, in a range of 2.5 to 3.0 percent per year, and the sale of under-utilized assets. Strengthening the Global Management Team Over the past four years, the company has assembled a deep bench of proven executives from both within and outside the company. Some examples of recent executive changes are: -- Dave Moran, Executive Vice President, President and CEO, North American Consumer Products, will assume responsibility for a combined North American Consumer Products and Foodservice divisions at the beginning of FY2008. Mr. Moran has been working in tandem with Jeff Berger, CEO of Heinz Foodservice, to pursue synergies across the two businesses, which represent 50 percent of global sales. By unifying the North American business under a single leader, the opportunity for additional growth and cross-fertilization is tremendous. Since the establishment of the Consumer Products unit in 2003, Mr. Moran and the energized U.S. and Canadian teams have delivered cumulative sales growth of 21 percent and profit growth (excluding special items) of 30 percent. -- Jeff Berger, who has been President and CEO of Heinz Foodservice since 1994 and has overseen the dynamic growth of the Foodservice division for two decades, will become Chairman of Global Foodservice. Mr. Berger will provide Mr. Moran with invaluable expertise and customer relationship advice through FY2009. -- Scott O' Hara joined Heinz on Jan 1, 2006 and is President and CEO of Heinz Europe. Mr. O'Hara is a food industry executive steeped in aggressive cost reduction and growth and is veteran of the European market with a strong track record of results. -- David Woodward will join Heinz on June 26, 2006, as the new President of Heinz U.K. & Ireland. Mr. Woodward will leverage his extensive experience following his successful record with several large consumer packaged goods companies in the U.K. -- Mike Hsu, under whose leadership the Ore-Ida(R) and Smart Ones(R) brands have blazed the trail of disciplined new product development for Heinz, has been appointed President and Chief Operating Officer of U.S. foodservice. Mr. Hsu's brand-building skills will be instrumental in accelerating the growth of the largely branded Foodservice business with its growing customers, while helping bridge the narrowing divide between the converging retail and foodservice businesses. -- John Hans, one of the architects of the successful U.S. Consumer Products trade spend efficiency model, has assumed the role of Vice President of Sales for the U.K., where he will migrate that successful model to drive substantial and immediate trade spend improvement. -- Suzanne Douglas, General Manager of Marketing for Australia, who has overseen a significant improvement in new product development and success rates in her native country, has been appointed Chief Marketing Officer for the U.K., where she will be charged with energizing the family of Heinz(R) brands.
