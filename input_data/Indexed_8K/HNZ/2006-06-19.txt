Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On June 13, 2006, the Management Development & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors granted long-term performance awards under the Fiscal Year 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to certain executives, including the named executive officers. The target award opportunity for each executive is expressed as a percentage of salary (the "Award"), and payout will vary above or below target based on the achievement of performance goals and restrictions and conditions specified by the Committee. The actual amount paid may range from 0% to 200% of the target Award, as described below.
     Awards are payable at the end of the two consecutive fiscal year period of Fiscal Year 2007 and Fiscal Year 2008 (May 4, 2006 through April 30, 2008) (the "Performance Period") based upon the Company's achieving targets set for each of the following metrics:
 
     Any actual awards will be paid in cash; provided that if an executive has not met applicable stock ownership guidelines, 50% of the actual award paid to the executive, after taxes, will be paid in the form of restricted stock units, which will vest at the time the actual award is paid, but will not be distributed as Common Stock until the executive has met applicable stock ownership guidelines.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
