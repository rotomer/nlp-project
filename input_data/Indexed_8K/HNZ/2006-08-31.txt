GENERAL ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated August 31, 2006 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies, in the first quarter ended July 27, 2005 only, certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items included costs for downsizing and strategic review. There were no special items in the first quarter of Fiscal 2007. Operating segment income and net income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believe are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow as defined below. This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, including the progress of management to profitably monetize low return assets. The sale of low return assets will include, as previously discussed, the reduction of production facilities throughout the world. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures and cash received from disposals of property, plant and equipment, the net of which is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. Disclosed on Exhibit 99.1 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the first quarter periods of Fiscal Years 2007 and 2006.

Exhibit 99.1 Heinz's Superior Value & Growth Plan Off to a Strong Start as the Company Delivers First Quarter Fiscal 2007 EPS of $0.58, up 23.4% (Excluding Discontinued Operations and Special Items in the Prior Year) PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 31, 2006--H. J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ): -- Sales up 8.4%; -- Volume up 5.1% fueled by higher consumption, new product introductions and increased innovation across all segments; -- Operating income, excluding special items in the prior year, up 10.5%; -- Heinz reported EPS from continuing operations of $0.58, up 45%, from $0.40 in the prior year; -- Company on Track to Deliver 10% plus EPS Growth for Full Year. H. J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today reported outstanding financial results for its first quarter with strong sales and net income growth. The Company reported net income of $194.1 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for its first quarter ended August 2, 2006. This compares to net income of $157.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share in the prior year, which included profit from the discontinued European seafood and New Zealand poultry businesses along with special items. Excluding discontinued operations and special items in the prior year, Heinz's first quarter EPS in Fiscal 2007 increased 23.4% versus $0.47 per diluted share in the prior year, and net income increased 18.6% from $163.7 in the prior year. There were no special items in Fiscal 2007. First-quarter sales increased 8.4%, to $2.06 billion from $1.90 billion, with double-digit growth in sales of the Company's 10 core brands, led by Weight Watchers(R)(a) Smart Ones(R) meals, Classico(R) pasta sauces, Plasmon(R) infant nutrition products and ABC(R) soy and chili sauces. Sales were aided by net pricing (+0.9%); acquisitions, net of divestitures (+1.4%); and foreign exchange translation rates (+1.1%). Volume increased 5.1%, reflecting growth in all of the Company's segments, driven by higher consumption, new product introductions and increased innovation. Commenting on the Company's performance, Heinz Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "Heinz delivered dynamic growth in sales, volume, operating income and EPS in the first quarter, reflecting the success of the Company's aggressive plan to drive sales of our core brands, reduce costs and enhance shareholder value. Fiscal 2007 is off to a strong start and Heinz remains on track to deliver 10% plus growth in earnings per share for the full year." (Comments on the first quarter that follow refer to adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income for Fiscal 2006, which exclude special items. There were no special items in FY2007. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they enable investors to use financial measures that management uses in addition to GAAP measures to evaluate the day-to-day operations of the business.) Gross profit in the first quarter of 2007 of $772.4 million increased 9.6% from adjusted gross profit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, and the gross profit margin increased to 37.5% from the adjusted gross profit in 2006 of 37.1%. These increases were due to higher volume, increased pricing and higher margin acquisitions, partially offset by substantially higher commodity costs. Operating income of $319.6 million increased 10.5% from adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2006, largely due to increased volume, the higher adjusted gross profit margin and the prior year targeted workforce reductions, particularly in Europe and Asia. These increases were partially offset by a 22% increase in marketing expense, higher selling and distribution costs resulting from increased volume, higher professional fees in the Non-Operating segment and higher accrued incentive compensation costs, including the expensing of stock options. The operating income increase of 10.5% combined with a lower effective tax rate of 20.3%, resulted in the 23.4% EPS increase. During the first quarter, a foreign subsidiary revalued certain of its assets, which is expected to reduce fiscal 2007 tax expense by approximately $35 million of which approximately $25 million was recorded in the first quarter. The Company still anticipates an effective tax rate for the full 2007 fiscal year of approximately 30%. Heinz's working capital management showed continued improvement over the prior year, as the Cash Conversion Cycle for the quarter improved nine days, to 47 days, reflecting improvements in the current year core operations and the impact of prior year divestitures. For perspective the Company's Cash Conversion Cycle was 92 days at the end of FY2002. The Company generated $33 million of Operating Free Cash Flow (cash flow from operations plus proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment less capital expenditures) in the first quarter of Fiscal 2007. The Company is pleased to report strong progress against most of the key operating commitments made as part of its Superior Value & Growth Plan announced on June 1, 2006 including a reduction in its total number of production facilities. Year-to-date, the Company has divested six facilities, including three in North America, one in Europe, one in Africa and one in Asia and has a pending agreement on a seventh facility expected to be completed in the second quarter. FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 13%. Volume increased 4.3%, reflecting strong growth across the entire portfolio lead by Weight Watchers(R)(a) Smart Ones(R) meals, Boston Market(R) meals(a), Classico(R) pasta sauces, Delimex(R) frozen meals and T.G.I. Friday's(R) frozen snacks(a). All of these brands set new volume records, which helped Consumer Products extend its sales growth to nine consecutive quarters. Heinz U.S. retail ketchup volume declined as anticipated due to reduced promotions as the Company implements its strategy to trade consumers up to larger, more profitable sizes. This strategy is working, with sales of larger size retail ketchup bottles up 50 percent in the quarter. Pricing expanded by 2.2%. The growth of the Classico(R) brand was fueled by new flavors and a new marketing campaign. Weight Watchers(R)(a) Smart Ones(R) continued momentum reflects substantial improvements in product performance, on-trend new offerings and better packaging. Delimex(R) is responding to new radio advertising in key markets, and T.G.I. Friday's(R)(a) frozen snack distribution is up 16% behind new products and improved graphics. Adjusted operating income increased 13.9% due primarily to increased volume, higher pricing and the favorable impact of acquisitions. These were partially offset by increased commodity costs and research and development costs, as well as increased marketing expenses, primarily related to increased investment behind frozen snacks and Weight Watchers(R)(a) Smart Ones(R) frozen entrees. U.S. FOODSERVICE Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased 3.8%. Volume increased 5%, mainly due to single serve condiments and Heinz(R) ketchup, as well as continued expansion of frozen soup driven by new customers. Pricing reduced sales 0.4% and divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 0.8%. Adjusted operating income increased 6.3% primarily due to the Kabobs, Inc. acquisition and increased volume, partially offset by increased incentive compensation accruals. EUROPE Heinz Europe's sales increased 6.8%. Volume rose 2.2%, with gains in the Plasmon(R) infant feeding business in Italy behind a successful TV campaign and increased promotions supporting the 25th anniversary of the Oasis program. Europe's volume growth also reflects increased sales of Heinz(R) ketchup, resulting from new customers, including McDonald's. Increased marketing and promotional support helped drive all time high ketchup market shares in Spain and Germany and volume growth on Top Down Ketchup in France. In Poland, Heinz achieved 22.2% volume growth, driven by increased marketing support behind the Pudliszki ready meals restage, cooking sauces and ketchup. The acquisitions of HP Foods and Petrosoyuz in Fiscal 2006 increased sales 7.0%. Pricing decreased sales 0.5%. Divestitures reduced sales 4.8% and favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 11.7% due to the favorable impact of acquisitions, increased volume and reduced general and administrative expenses ("G&A"). These improvements were partially offset by increased raw material costs and increased marketing expenses. The reduction in G&A is primarily a result of the prior-year targeted workforce reductions including the elimination of European headquarters. ASIA PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased 12.2%. Volume increased significantly, up 13.4%, reflecting strong volume in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and China, largely due to new product introductions and increased marketing. Higher pricing, primarily in Indonesia, increased sales 1.3%. China benefited from on-going strength in the Long Fong business which continues to expand behind increased market penetration and the success of a new range of premium products. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 2.6%. Adjusted operating income increased 27.2% primarily due to strong volume improvements, higher pricing and reduced G&A, resulting from targeted workforce reductions including the elimination of Asia headquarters in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by increased commodity costs and unfavorable mix in Indonesia. REST OF WORLD (ROW) In Heinz's ROW segment, sales were consistent with the prior year as higher volume and pricing were offset by prior year divestitures and unfavorable foreign exchange. Volume increased 5.8% due to increased market share on nutritional drinks in India and ketchup and baby food in Latin America. Higher pricing increased sales by 7.1%, reflecting price increases on baby food and reduced promotions on ketchup in Latin America. Sales were reduced by 10.5% due to divestitures in Fiscal 2006. Foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales by 2.3%. Adjusted operating income increased 42.1%, due mainly to increased pricing and improved business mix.
