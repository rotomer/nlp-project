Exhibit 99.1 Heinz Board Approves Majority Voting PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 8, 2006--H. J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) said today that its Board of Directors has approved a proposed amendment to the company's Articles of Incorporation that, if adopted by the shareholders, will require approval of the election of directors in uncontested elections by a majority vote of shareholders. Currently, Heinz operates under a plurality voting standard, where the directors who receive the most "for" votes are elected. The proposed amendment to the Articles of Incorporation would change the plurality voting standard to a majority voting standard. This amendment will be placed on the ballot for approval by the Heinz shareholders at its 2007 annual meeting. If approved, the revised majority voting standard will apply to future uncontested director elections. Under the proposed amended Articles, a director who does not receive a majority of "for" votes based on the number of votes cast will be required to offer his or her resignation, which will be reviewed promptly by the Corporate Governance Committee and acted upon by the full Board. In order to implement majority voting commencing with the 2007 director election when the amendment to the Articles will be considered by the shareholders, the Board adopted a majority voting policy for the election of directors in uncontested elections. The policy will be incorporated into the company's Corporate Governance Principles and will operate in a manner consistent with the proposed amendment to the Articles. The Board also adopted a policy under which it will seek shareholder approval within one year in the event it adopts a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a "poison pill." The Board reiterated that Heinz expects to expand the Board to 14 from 12 directors in the near future. The Board search is being led by Spencer Stuart, one of the world's leading recruitment firms which also specializes in board director appointments. Heinz Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said, "These actions are consistent with Heinz's commitment to good corporate governance. Furthermore, Heinz is focused on executing our plan to enhance shareholder value and accelerate growth, and is firmly on track to achieve 10 percent earnings growth and its target of $2.35 for the year."
