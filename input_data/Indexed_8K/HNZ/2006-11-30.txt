GENERAL ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated November 30, 2006 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies, in the second quarter and six months ended October 26, 2005 only, certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items included costs for downsizing and strategic review as well as a net charge primarily related to the sale of a seafood business in Israel. There were no special items in the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal Year 2007. Operating segment income and net income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believes are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow as defined below. This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, including the progress of management to profitably monetize low return assets. The sale of low return assets will include, as previously discussed, the reduction of production facilities throughout the world. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures and cash received from disposals of property, plant and equipment, the net of which is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. Disclosed on Exhibit 99.1 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the second quarter periods and six month periods of Fiscal Years 2007 and 2006.

Exhibit 99.1 Heinz Reports Another Strong Quarter and Raises Full Year EPS Outlook to a Range of $2.35 to $2.39 due to Strong Business Momentum Heinz Delivers Operating Income Growth of 10.2% in the Second Quarter (excluding special items in the prior year) -- Sales grew 3.5% and volume rose 2.5%, driven by global innovation, marketing and new products. Net of acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 6.1%; -- The operating income growth, excluding special items, was driven by increased volume and a 50 basis point improvement in gross profit margin. Reported operating income increased to $383 million from $301 million in the second quarter last year; -- EPS of $0.59 from continuing operations compared to $0.60 for the second quarter last year (excluding special items) due to a higher tax rate of 34.8% in this quarter compared to 23.8% a year ago. The full year estimated tax rate is 30%; -- Through the first half of Fiscal 2007, sales were up 5.8% and operating income (excluding prior year special items) up 10.4%. Business Editors PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 30, 2006--Building on an excellent first quarter, H. J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today reported strong operating income growth of 10% for its second quarter (excluding special items in the prior year) driven by outstanding performance of Heinz's top brands and products. Sales increased 3.5%, as the Company's focus and investment behind its top brands resulted in impressive growth including Heinz(R) branded products (9% growth), Weight Watchers(R) Smart Ones(R) meals (17% growth), Classico(R) pasta sauces (9% growth), T.G.I. Friday's(R) frozen snacks (12% growth), Plasmon(R) baby food (7% growth) and Weight Watchers(R) meals (11% growth). On a total company basis, including the impact of discontinued operations, the Company reported net income of $191.6 million or $0.57 per diluted share in the current quarter, compared to $203.8 million or $0.60 per share in the prior year. On a continuing operations basis, the Company reported income of $197.4 million or $0.59 per share compared to $168.3 million or $0.49 per share in the prior year. Excluding discontinued operations and special items in the prior year only, net income was $197.4 million in the current quarter or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $205.4 million or $0.60 per share as the prior year benefited from a very low tax rate. The tax rate for the quarter was 34.8% compared to 23.8% a year ago, excluding special items. There were no special items in the second quarter of Fiscal 2007. Commenting on the Company's performance, Heinz's Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "We are pleased by the excellent operating results in the quarter. Sales of our top ten brands grew by 8% and total Heinz operating income for the quarter increased 10%. North American Consumer Products continued its strong momentum with sales up 7.5% and operating income up 12.5%. Our businesses in Europe are building momentum and generated 9.7% operating income growth in the quarter. Capitalizing on the health and wellness trend, sales of the Heinz brand worldwide grew 9%, the Weight Watchers Smart Ones brand was up 17%, the Classico brand was up 9% and Weight Watchers from Heinz(R) meals in the UK grew 11%. Our Asia Pacific businesses grew sales 6% and profit 16% as a result of new product introductions and increased marketing. I am also pleased by our continued improvements in working capital management - where we reduced the Cash Conversion Cycle for the quarter by 10 days, to a record low of 49 days." Mr. Johnson continued, "Through the first half of the year, we have driven sales growth of almost 6% and operating income growth of better than 10%, and we are tracking well against the commitments we made on June 1." INNOVATION IN HEALTH, WELLNESS & CONVENIENCE As one of the original companies dedicated to "Pure Food," Heinz's brand portfolio is uniquely positioned to harness the growing consumer demand for healthy eating options, while continuing to provide solutions for convenience-seeking consumers. A sampling of Heinz's exciting new product initiatives in health, wellness and convenience in the quarter included: -- In the U.S. -- the introduction of Classico organic pasta sauces. -- In Australia and New Zealand -- the launch of Heinz Fruit Splat(TM) and Wattie's Fruit Squirtz(TM) ranges of strained fruit snacks with no added sugars, colors or preservatives in single-serve packs equal to one portion of fruit. Also, the continued expansion of the steamfresh line of vegetables and vegetable based meals. -- In Italy -- a range of special care infant foods in the Plasmon brand offering Italian parents solutions for children who have digestion problems, difficulty sleeping, food allergies or are underweight. -- In Canada -- the successful launch of Weight Watchers Smart Ones meals. "We have launched more than 100 great-tasting new products this year, which we are supporting with strong consumer marketing, as well as effective customer co-marketing and in-store promotional activities," Mr. Johnson said. "We have robust new product pipelines across all of our major business segments that are helping to drive positive growth and margin expansion." (Comments herein refer to the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income for Fiscal 2006, which exclude special items, and Operating Free Cash Flow for 2007. There have been no special items in Fiscal 2007. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they enable investors to use financial measures that management uses in addition to GAAP measures to evaluate the day-to-day operations of the business.) SECOND QUARTER SUMMARY Second quarter sales increased 3.5%, to $2.23 billion from $2.16 billion. Sales increased 2.5% from volume, 1.7% from net pricing and 1.8% from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 2.6% decline from the impact of divestitures, net of acquisitions. The volume increase was driven by the continued success of our business in North America with increased innovation and marketing behind Weight Watchers Smart Ones meals and Boston Market(R) entrees. The volume results were also driven by frozen entrees globally and a number of new product introductions, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. Gross profit margin in the second quarter increased to 37.9% from the adjusted gross profit in 2006 of 37.4%. These increases reflect higher volume and increased pricing and were partially offset by commodity cost increases and the impact of divestitures. Operating income in the second quarter of Fiscal 2007 of $383.0 million, increased 10.2% from adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2006, largely due to increased volume in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand, the higher gross profit margin and reductions in selling and distribution expenses ("S&D") and general and administrative expenses ("G&A"). S&D and G&A declined, despite volume increases, as a result of strong productivity gains and targeted workforce reductions last year. These declines were partially offset by increased marketing expense, particularly in the North American Consumer Products segment, and increased compensation costs related to the adoption of FAS 123R in the current year. The operating income increase of 10.2% was offset by an increase in the effective tax rate of 11 percentage points to 34.8%, and resulted in a 1.7% decline in EPS. The higher effective tax rate is due to the benefit in the prior year from the reversal of a tax provision of $23.4 million related to a foreign affiliate, partially offset by the non-deductibility of certain asset write-offs taken that quarter. The Company continues to anticipate that the reported tax rate on continuing operations for the year will be approximately 30%. Heinz's working capital management showed continued improvement over the prior year, as the Cash Conversion Cycle for the quarter improved 10 days, to 49 days, reflecting improvements in the current year core operations and the impact of prior year divestitures. The Company generated $176 million of Operating Free Cash Flow (cash flow from operations plus proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment less capital expenditures) in the second quarter of Fiscal 2007. SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 7.5%. Volume increased 4.7%, largely resulting from strong growth in Classico pasta sauces and Weight Watchers Smart Ones and Boston Market(R) frozen entrees, sides and desserts. Volume increases were also generated from increased consumption of T.G.I. Friday's and Bagel Bites(R) frozen snacks and Heinz(R) gravy. Pricing increased 1.0% largely due to Heinz(R) ketchup and Ore-Ida frozen potatoes. Acquisitions increased sales 0.8%, primarily from the recent acquisition of Renee's Gourmet Foods, a Canadian manufacturer of premium refrigerated salad dressings, sauces, dips, marinades and mayonnaise. Favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 1.0%. Adjusted operating income increased 12.5%, due primarily to increased volume, higher pricing, manufacturing efficiencies in the Canadian business and lower selling and delivery costs. These increases were partially offset by increased marketing expenses, primarily for Weight Watchers Smart Ones meals, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and frozen snacks. U.S. FOODSERVICE Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased 5.4% primarily as a result of higher volume. Volume rose 5.1%, due to higher volume in Heinz ketchup and frozen soup, appetizers and desserts. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 2.1%. Adjusted operating income increased 13.3% primarily due to increased volume and cost reduction programs. This increase was partially offset by higher commodity costs. In addition, operating income benefited from lower S&D costs as a percentage of sales, reflecting strong productivity initiatives to reduce transportation costs. EUROPE Adjusted operating income increased 9.7% due to higher pricing and reduced G&A. The decrease in G&A is chiefly a result of prior year targeted workforce reductions, including the virtual elimination of European headquarters. Marketing expense is expected to increase in the second half of the year with the planned launch of HP Top Down, and the Dreamz Meanz(TM) Heinz initiative, an integrated consumer and trade promotion that runs across the entire Heinz brand portfolio in the UK. Sales excluding acquisitions and divestitures, were up 4.4% driven by growth in Heinz ketchup across Europe, Heinz(R) beans in the UK, and Pudlizski sauces in Poland. Heinz ketchup growth was driven primarily by increased marketing and wider distribution. Overall, sales decreased 0.8% as higher pricing on Heinz(R) soup and pasta meals in the UK was offset by reduced volume in Italy and Russia due to reduced promotions and competitive pressures. The acquisition of HP Foods in Fiscal 2006 increased sales by 1.5% and favorable exchange rates increased sales by 4.7%. ASIA PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased a robust 6.0%. Volume increased sales 3.7% reflecting continued strong volume in Australia and New Zealand, largely due to new product introductions, such as Weight Watchers steamfresh vegetables and meals. Adjusted operating income increased 16.4% as higher volume and net pricing along with lower G&A was only partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased marketing. The reduction in G&A is a result of targeted workforce reductions, including the virtual elimination of Asian headquarters. REST OF WORLD (ROW) Sales for ROW, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, were up double digits in the quarter. Overall sales decreased 4.0%, as divestitures reduced sales 13.6% and foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales 3.1%. Volume increased 6.8% due primarily to market and share growth in nutritional drinks in India and growth in baby food in Latin America. Higher pricing increased sales by 5.9%, largely due to reduced promotions and price increases taken in Latin America. Adjusted operating income increased 13.5% as increased pricing was partially offset by the impact of divestitures. YEAR TO DATE HIGHLIGHTS Sales for the six months ended November 1, 2006 increased 5.8%. Sales were favorably impacted by a volume increase of 3.7%. Positive increases were generated in all of the Company's segments, led by the North American Consumer Products and U.S. Foodservice segments. Strong volume increases were also noted in our businesses in Australia, New Zealand and Italy, as well as in the emerging markets of India, China and Poland, in line with the Company's strategy to focus on such key emerging markets. Net pricing increased sales by 1.4%. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased sales by 0.7%. Foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 1.5%. Adjusted operating income for the six months increased 10.4%, which was favorably impacted by increased volume and the higher gross profit margin of 37.7% versus 37.2% last year. Income from continuing operations was $1.17 per diluted share in the six months ended November 1, 2006, compared to income from continuing operations, excluding special items, in the prior six months of $1.07 per share. On a total company basis, net income was $1.15 per diluted share this year compared to $1.04 per diluted share last year.
