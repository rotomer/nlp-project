GENERAL ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated February 27, 2007 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies, in the third quarter and nine months ended January 25, 2006 only, certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items included costs for downsizing, integration, separation and preparation for sale, net losses on dispositions and impairments in anticipation of potential sales. There were no special items in the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal Year 2007. Gross profit, operating segment income and net income excluding these special items are not measures that are defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believes are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow as defined below. This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, including the progress of management to profitably monetize low return assets. The sale of low return assets will include, as previously discussed, the reduction of production facilities throughout the world. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures and cash received from disposals of property, plant and equipment, the net of which is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. Disclosed on Exhibit 99.1 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the third quarter periods and nine month periods of Fiscal Years 2007 and 2006.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit NO. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 H. J. Heinz Company Press Release dated February 27, 2007

Exhibit 99.1 Heinz Reports Strong Third Quarter Sales and Profit Results Driven by Outstanding Performance in Top 15 Brands -- Overall Company Sales grew 5.0% and volume and price combined rose 3.7%, driven by global innovation and a 21% increase in marketing; -- Sales for Heinz's top 15 brands grew 11%; -- Operating income grew 9.0% excluding special items in the prior year. Operating income increased 22% on a reported basis; -- EPS from continuing operations increased 32% to $0.66 compared to EPS of $0.50 last year. (Prior year EPS excludes special charges of $0.11 per share); -- Full Year EPS Outlook is $2.35 to $2.39, an increase of 12 to 14 percent versus last year (excluding prior year special items). Business Editors PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 27, 2007--Continuing its excellent Fiscal 2007 performance, H. J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today reported strong sales, operating income and EPS growth versus prior year. The results continue to be driven by consumer-oriented innovation and increased marketing investment in support of Heinz's top brands and products. Sales increased 5.0% driven by impressive double-digit growth in Heinz's top brands including Heinz(R) branded products, Smart Ones(R) meals, Classico(R) pasta sauces, Plasmon(R) baby food and ABC(R) branded products. Commenting on the Company's performance, Heinz's Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: "We are pleased to report another excellent quarter at Heinz. Our increased strategic focus on health and wellness, increased marketing support for successful innovations, and accelerating growth in fast-growing emerging economies like China, Indonesia, Poland and India is driving continued performance improvements. Based on our results to-date and on our outlook, Heinz remains on track to meet its full-year EPS projection of $2.35 to $2.39, an increase of 12 to 14 percent versus last year." On a total company basis, including the impact of discontinued operations, the Company reported net income of $219.0 million or $0.66 per diluted share for the quarter compared to $116.6 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year. On a continuing operations basis, the Company reported income of $219.0 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to $133.2 million of $0.39 per diluted share in the prior year. Excluding discontinued operations and special items in the prior year only, as there were no special items in the third quarter, net income was $219.0 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to $168.0 or $0.50 per diluted share in the prior year. This significant 32% improvement is a result of higher sales, improved gross margins, a 9% increase in operating income, and a lower effective tax rate for the quarter of 26.0% compared to 35.5% a year ago, excluding prior year special items. The Company's full year EPS outlook of $2.35 to $2.39 assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 30%. INNOVATION IN HEALTH, WELLNESS & CONVENIENCE The accelerating global consumer trend towards health and wellness is creating numerous growth opportunities for Heinz, which is the world's largest provider of lycopene-rich, tomato-based products like Heinz(R) Ketchup and Classico(R) pasta sauces and Pudliszki(R) sauces and Heinz(R) Cream of Tomato soup - the U.K.'s biggest selling variety. Heinz is also a global leader in other good-for-you foods like high-fiber beans, healthy soups and infant nutrition, as well as the Smart Ones(R) and Weight Watchers from Heinz(R) ranges of healthy convenience meals and snacks. "As announced last week at CAGNY, I have asked Dave Moran, President and CEO of Heinz North America, to lead a global Heinz taskforce to accelerate the health and wellness activities across our top brands and ensure that our new product and marketing efforts leverage the Company's well-positioned portfolio," Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Johnson continued, "We are encouraged by the strong consumer acceptance of the more than 100 new products we launched around the Heinz world this year, and will build on this success with our planned launch of an unprecedented wave of more than 200 new products in Fiscal 2008. The products have been designed to meet the consumer trifecta of great taste, health, and convenience." SUPPLY CHAIN/PRODUCTIVITY Fueling the Company's innovation and marketing increases are productivity gains that are running ahead of the two-year growth plan announced last June. Specifically, Heinz is on track to: -- Achieve global supply chain savings of approximately $175 million, about $10 million above the Fiscal 2007 target; -- Reduce global deals and allowances from 18.1 percent of sales last year to 17.2 percent this year; -- Exit 15 plants; and -- Exceed SG&A productivity targets by 10%. To ensure continued productivity improvements, Scott O'Hara, President and CEO of Heinz Europe, has been appointed to lead a Heinz global supply chain taskforce. Mr. Johnson said, "Our productivity gains combined with prudent pricing have allowed us to offset commodity cost headwinds while still investing aggressively in current and future growth. I am confident that Scott will leverage the excellent cost cutting experience he gained at Gillette to better coordinate our productivity initiatives and drive global best practices across our business units." (Comments herein refer to the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income for Fiscal 2006, which exclude special items, and Operating Free Cash Flow for 2007. There have been no special items in Fiscal 2007. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they enable investors to use financial measures that management uses in addition to GAAP measures to evaluate the day-to-day operations of the business.) THIRD QUARTER SUMMARY Third quarter sales increased 5.0%, to $2.30 billion from $2.19 billion. Sales increased 1.4% from volume, 2.3% from net pricing and 4.0% from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 2.7% decline from the impact of divestitures, net of acquisitions. The volume increase was driven primarily by the North American Consumer Products, Italian infant nutrition and Australian businesses. Approximately one third of the quarter's volume increase was driven by Heinz's emerging RICIP markets of Russia, India, China, Indonesia and Poland. Gross profit margin in the third quarter increased to 37.1% from the adjusted gross profit margin in 2006 of 36.5%, reflecting higher pricing and productivity initiatives, partially offset by commodity cost increases. Gross profit benefited from higher volume and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by the impact of divestitures. Operating income in the third quarter of Fiscal 2007 of $376.3 million, increased 9.0% from adjusted operating income in the third quarter of 2006, largely due to the higher sales and gross profit margin, as well as the targeted workforce reductions in the prior year. These were partially offset by a more than 20% increase in marketing expense and increased compensation costs, including the impact of the adoption of FAS 123R. The operating income increase of 9.0%, combined with a lower effective tax rate of 26.0% and a 1.6% reduction in shares outstanding, resulted in a 32% increase in EPS. The Company continues to expect a reported tax rate on continuing operations for the year of approximately 30%. Heinz's working capital management showed continued improvement over the prior year, as the Cash Conversion Cycle for the quarter improved 7 days to 57 days, reflecting improvements in the current year core operations and the impact of prior year divestitures. The Company generated $72 million of Operating Free Cash Flow (cash flow from operations plus proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment less capital expenditures) in the third quarter of Fiscal 2007. THIRD QUARTER SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 8.5%. Volume increased 5.2%, as a result of continued strong growth in Smart Ones(R) meals and Boston Market(R) entrees and desserts as well as solid growth in Heinz(R) ketchup. Volume increases were generated from increased consumption of both Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes and T.G.I. Friday's(R) snacks, as well as from Classico(R) pasta sauces, driven by successful product launches and increased marketing and promotions. In addition, Heinz Canada generated significant volume growth of approximately 11%, with improvements across the majority of its portfolio. Pricing increased 1.7% largely due to Heinz(R) ketchup, Boston Market(R) entrees and sides and Classico(R) pasta sauces. Acquisitions increased sales 1.4%, due to the acquisition of Renee's Gourmet Foods, a Canadian manufacturer of premium salad dressings, sauces, dips, marinades and mayonnaise. Adjusted operating income increased almost 5%, due primarily to increased volume and higher pricing, partially offset by increased manufacturing and marketing costs. G&A was flat with the prior year and S&D as a percentage of sales declined, due to distribution efficiencies. U.S. FOODSERVICE Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased 3.8% and volume decreased 4.3%. Heinz(R) ketchup sales grew almost 7% for the quarter behind higher volume and favorable net pricing. This growth was offset by lower frozen soup sales related to warm weather early in the quarter and the exit of several low-margin contracts in the PPI business unit. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 2.1%. Pricing increased 2.6%, reflecting lower deal spending on Heinz(R) ketchup, Heinz(R) tomato products and frozen desserts. Adjusted operating income decreased $2.9 million due to the volume decline, higher commodity costs and increased G&A. Favorable net pricing and reduced S&D costs offset a portion of these variances. EUROPE Sales increased 5.3% including organic volume, price and mix of 1.4%. Higher pricing increased sales 2.0%, driven primarily by reduced promotions on Heinz(R) soup in the U.K. as well as increases in infant feeding in both Italy and the U.K. Reported volume decreased 0.6%, as improvements in the Italian infant nutrition business, Heinz(R) ketchup across Europe, Heinz(R) beans in the U.K., Weight Watchers from Heinz frozen ready meals and the Pudliszki(R) products in Poland were offset by reduced sales of Heinz(R) soup reflecting the Company's decision to reduce deal spending, as well as softness in the European non-branded frozen desserts business. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 10.5% and divestitures reduced sales 6.6%. Adjusted operating income increased 9.7% due to higher pricing, reduced G&A and favorable exchange translation rates, and was partially offset by higher marketing expense, the impact of divestitures and increased commodity costs. The decrease in G&A reflects prior year targeted workforce reductions, including the downsizing of Heinz's European headquarters. The increase in marketing expense is due to the increased investment the Company is making in its key brands, including Plasmon(R), Heinz(R), and Pudliszki(R). ASIA/PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased 6.5%. Volume increased sales 2.5%, reflecting continued strong performance in Australia (+9%) and our Long Fong frozen food business in China (+11%), both largely due to new product introductions. Price increases in Indonesia and New Zealand increased sales 1.8%. Divestitures reduced sales 0.6% and favorable foreign exchange translation rates increased sales 2.9%. Adjusted operating income increased 52.1% or $9.5 million due primarily to the volume improvements, higher pricing, reduced commodity costs in Indonesia and reduced G&A, partially offset by increased marketing. REST OF WORLD (ROW) Sales for Rest of World increased 10.9%. Volume increased 10.9% due primarily to increased demand and marketing support for nutritional drinks in India and increases in ketchup and baby food in Latin America. Higher pricing increased sales by 8.6%, largely due to reduced promotions and price increases in Latin America. Divestitures reduced sales 7.5% and foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales 1.0%. Adjusted operating income increased 43.5% or $3.6 million primarily resulting from increased volume and higher pricing. YEAR TO DATE HIGHLIGHTS Sales for the nine months ended January 31, 2007 increased 5.5%. Sales were favorably impacted by a volume increase of 2.9%, led by the North American Consumer Products segment and the Australian business. Strong volume increases were also generated in New Zealand, Italian infant nutrition, U.S. Foodservice and the emerging markets of India, China and Poland, in line with the Company's strategy to focus on key emerging markets. These increases were partially offset by declines in the U.K. and Russia. Net pricing increased sales by 1.7%. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased sales by 1.4%, while foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 2.4%. Adjusted operating income for the nine months increased 9.9%, and was favorably impacted by higher volume and improved gross profit margin of 37.5% versus 37.0% last year. Income from continuing operations was $1.83 per diluted share in the nine months ended January 31, 2007, compared to income from continuing operations, excluding special items, in the prior nine months of $1.56 per share, an increase of 17%. On a total company basis, net income was $1.81 per diluted share this year compared to $1.39 per diluted share last year.
