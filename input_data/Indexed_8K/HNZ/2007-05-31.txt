GENERAL ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated May 31, 2007 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. This press release presents the financial results of the Registrant and its business segments and identifies, in the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 3, 2006 only, certain special items that impacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These special items included costs for downsizing, integration, separation and preparation for sale, net losses on dispositions, impairments in anticipation of potential sales, non-cash asset impairment charges for cost and equity investments, and the impact of the American Jobs Creation Act. There were no special items in the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 2, 2007. Operating segment income and net income excluding these special items is not a measure that is defined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These special items are measures that management believes are important to adjust for in order to have a meaningful year to year comparison and to provide a basis for future projections and for estimating our earnings growth prospects. These non-GAAP measures are used by management as a supplemental performance measure to judge profitability of core businesses absent special items. For compensation purposes, for example, it would unfairly reward or punish managers for corporate special charges outside their control. These measures provide a more consistent view of performance than the closest GAAP equivalent for management and investors. Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow as defined below. This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, including the progress of management to profitably monetize low return assets. The sale of low return assets will include, as previously discussed, the reduction of production facilities throughout the world. The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures and cash received from disposals of property, plant and equipment, the net of which is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. Disclosed on Exhibit 99.1 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the fourth quarters and fiscal years ended May 2, 2007 and May 3, 2006. ITEM 8.01 OTHER INFORMATION Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated May 31, 2007 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2 announcing an increase to the Company's dividend.

Exhibit 99.1 Heinz Announces Outstanding Results for Fiscal Year 2007, Exceeding Key Targets Established in Its Superior Value and Growth Plan Heinz Raises Earnings Outlook for Fiscal Year 2008, Citing Strong Innovation Pipeline and Solid Business Fundamentals Heinz Raises Dividend by 8.6% PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 31, 2007--FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS: -- For the full year, Heinz drove EPS growth of 13.3% to $2.38 (including 55 cents in the fourth quarter) from continuing operations excluding prior year special items. Prior year EPS of $2.10 excludes special charges of $0.80 per share. On a reported basis, EPS from continuing operations grew 84%. -- Sales grew 4.1%, driven by net pricing gains and solid volume growth, despite one less week in Fiscal 2007 versus the prior year. Sales for the Company's Top 15 Brands grew 8.5% and sales in the emerging "RICIP" markets increased 13%. -- Heinz achieved 7.2% growth in Operating Income (from continuing operations excluding prior year special items), including a $64 million incremental investment in consumer marketing - an increase of 24%. On a reported basis, operating income from continuing operations increased 30%. -- The Company generated $878 million of operating free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures plus proceeds from disposals of PP&E), 10% above its target for the year and ahead of Fiscal 2006. Return on invested capital increased by 100 basis points to 15.8%. -- Heinz raised its earnings outlook for Fiscal 2008 to an EPS range of $2.54 to $2.60. The H. J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today announced its fourth quarter and Fiscal Year 2007 results with full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.38, an increase of 13.3% over the prior year, excluding special items. The strong EPS results reflect solid top-line growth, margin improvement, and a renewed commitment to consumer-focused innovation. On a total company basis, Heinz reported net income growth of 21.7% to $785.7 million. For the full year, sales increased 4.1% to $9.0 billion and operating income increased $96.7 million, or 7.2%, excluding prior year special items, to $1.45 billion, driven by the sustained strong performance of the Company's North American Consumer Products, Asian, Latin American, Australian, and New Zealand businesses, and improving performance of the European business. The Company's top 15 brands all achieved impressive sales growth including Heinz(R) (+7%), Boston Market(R) (+39%), Pudliszki(R) (+32%), Smart Ones(R) (+13%) and Classico(R) (+12%). Heinz's global ketchup business reported strong results with 9% sales growth in Fiscal Year 2007. "Fiscal 2007 was a great year for Heinz as our business units successfully executed the first year of the FY07/08 Superior Value and Growth Plan, meeting or exceeding our key financial targets. We greatly enhanced our focus on the consumer with a stronger spotlight on health and wellness, increased investment in marketing for future growth, greater R&D, and impressive productivity measures that helped offset $180 million in commodity inflation," said William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our increased investment in growth this past year establishes a strong foundation for Fiscal 2008, giving us the confidence to increase our earnings outlook to a range of $2.54 to $2.60 and to raise the dividend by 8.6% on top of last year's 16.7% increase." The Company outlined its two-year financial targets and operating goals on June 1, 2006, when Heinz unveiled its Superior Value and Growth Plan. The plan called for 12% EPS growth in FY07, $1 billion in net share repurchases and $355 million in productivity improvements over two years. "The quality of our FY07 results and our enhanced outlook for Fiscal 2008, confirm that our talented people, tighter portfolio and stronger brand focus have transformed Heinz into a more nimble, innovative and consumer-focused company," said William R. Johnson. (Comments herein refer to the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating income for Fiscal 2006, which excludes special items, and operating free cash flow. There have been no special items in Fiscal 2007. See attached tables for further details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they enable investors to use financial measures that management uses in addition to GAAP measures to evaluate the day-to-day operations of the business.) FULL YEAR SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 7.3%. Volume increased 2.6%, (despite one less week than last year) primarily as a result of strong growth in Smart Ones(R) and Boston Market(R) frozen entrees and desserts and Classico(R) pasta sauces. Pricing increased 2.1% largely due to Heinz(R) ketchup, Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes, Smart Ones(R) frozen entrees and Bagel Bites(R) and T.G.I. Friday's(R) frozen snacks. Acquisitions increased sales 1.9%. Adjusted operating income increased 6.1% driven by the strong growth in sales and reduced manufacturing costs. Operating income was constrained by increased commodity costs, and a 40% increase in marketing investment to sustain future growth. U.S. FOODSERVICE Reflecting the impact of one less week in the fiscal year and the impact of divestitures, sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased 0.9%. Importantly, sales of the flagship ketchup business grew by more than 5%. Pricing increased sales 1.7%, largely due to Heinz(R) ketchup and tomato products, single serve condiments and frozen desserts. Volume decreased 0.4%, as higher volume in Heinz(R) ketchup was offset by declines resulting primarily from one less week in the fiscal year and a decision to exit certain low margin accounts. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 2.1%. Adjusted operating income increased 1.9%, primarily due to increased pricing and reduced selling and distribution expense (S&D), partially offset by higher commodity costs. S&D as a percentage of sales declined due to reduced transportation costs resulting from strong productivity initiatives. EUROPE Heinz Europe sales increased 3.0%. Pricing increased 1.7%, driven by value-added innovation and reduced promotions on Heinz(R) soup and pasta meals in the UK and in the Italian infant nutrition business. While the regions' volume declined 2.4% including the impact of one less week in the fiscal year, there were important volume improvements in ketchup, Heinz(R) beans and Weight Watchers(R) branded products. These were offset by Heinz(R) soup in the UK and market softness in non-Heinz Russian products and the non-branded European frozen businesses. Net divestitures reduced sales 3.7%, and favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 7.3%. Adjusted operating income increased 7.6% due to higher pricing, the favorable impact of exchange translation rates and reduced general and administrative expenses ("G&A"), partially offset by increased marketing and by increased raw potato and other manufacturing costs in our frozen food business. The decrease in G&A is chiefly a result of prior year targeted workforce reductions, including the elimination of European headquarters. ASIA/PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased 7.6%. Volume increased sales 4.2%, as a result of strong performance in Australia, New Zealand and China, reflecting increased brand marketing and new product introductions. Higher pricing increased sales 2.1%, mainly in response to commodity costs related to Indonesian sauces and drinks. Adjusted operating income increased 20.8% as a result of strong volume and margin improvement. REST OF WORLD Sales for Rest of World increased 2.9%. Volume increased 6.1% due primarily to market and share growth in nutritional drinks in India and sales growth in ketchup and baby food in Latin America. Pricing increased sales by 7.6% reflecting new product introductions and reduced promotions on ketchup as well as price increases on baby food in Latin America. Divestitures reduced sales 8.8% and foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales 1.9%. Adjusted operating income increased 17.8% due to increased volume and higher pricing. FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Solid fourth quarter results were in line with Heinz's expectations given one less week in the quarter which reduced order days by approximately 7% (2% for the full year). Heinz's top 15 brands grew sales 4.4% as a result of innovation and increased investment in marketing. During the fourth quarter, the Company substantially increased its marketing spend (+44%) as Heinz invested in future growth to support its upcoming robust new product pipeline. This spending was weighted heavily to the North American retail business which doubled its marketing investment from a year ago to drive brand awareness and trial as the Company enters the new Fiscal Year. In the quarter, sales increased by 0.6% as our healthy business momentum offset the one less week in the quarter compared to the previous year. Operating income equaled last year's operating income from continuing operations despite an increase in consumer marketing of $32 million in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 35.8%. EPS was $0.55 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.54 in the fourth quarter last year, excluding prior year special items. Heinz reported net income of $181.0 million, compared to net income of $167.9 million in the same period in the prior year. FISCAL YEAR 2008 OUTLOOK Looking ahead to Fiscal 2008, Heinz forecasts sales growth of around 4%, operating income growth of 7 to 9%, and an EPS range of $2.54 to $2.60 (up 7 to 9%). "Heinz is confident in its plans for sustaining momentum in Fiscal 2008 with a global pipeline of more than 200 consumer-validated new products designed to meet consumer demands for convenient healthy foods. We plan to support these initiatives with further increased marketing of $30 to $40 million," said William R. Johnson. "By the end of Fiscal Year 2008, we expect to have increased Heinz marketing spend by around $100 million or approximately 40% from FY2006 levels." Heinz expects its North American, Australian and New Zealand businesses to deliver strong and predictable growth in Fiscal 2008, and expects its emerging markets businesses in the RICIP and Latin American markets to grow to more than $1 billion in sales, driven by double-digit growth in China, India and Indonesia. Additionally, the Company is encouraged by the building momentum in Europe. With the May 2007 consolidation of the U.S. Foodservice and North American Consumer Products business under Executive Vice President, Dave Moran's leadership, Heinz expects to see improved results from the U.S. Foodservice business in the second half of Fiscal 2008. As Heinz previously announced on June 1, 2006, the Company expects to exit four to six manufacturing facilities in FY08 and will pursue additional global sourcing opportunities. Heinz will also continue to develop and improve its talent. "I am confident we have one of the best senior management teams in the consumer goods industry," Mr. Johnson said. "Our focus now is on developing our bench strength in the middle management ranks in each business unit through enhanced training, retention, and recruitment to ensure optimal execution of our business strategies." "Encouragingly, our more than 30,000 people across the world are collaborating more than ever to share their best ideas for product and process improvements."
