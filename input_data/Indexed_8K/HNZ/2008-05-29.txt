ITEM 2.02     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Attached is H.J. Heinz Company's press release dated May 29, 2008 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
This press release presents the business measure of organic sales growth, which is defined as volume plus price. This measure is utilized by senior management to provide investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis.
This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow as defined below. This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, including the progress of management to profitably monetize low return assets.
The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures and cash received from disposals of property, plant and equipment, the net of which is no longer available to the Company for other purposes.
Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows.
Disclosed on Exhibit 99.1 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the fourth quarters and fiscal years ended April 30, 2008 and May 2, 2007.

ITEM 8.01  OTHER EVENTS
Also attached is a copy of the five-year Summary of Financial Results presented at the analyst meeting held on May 29, 2008, furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.3. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company changed its segment reporting to reclassify its business in India from the Rest of World segment to the Asia/Pacific segment, reflecting organizational changes. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Heinz Achieves Record Sales of Over $10 Billion, Posts Double-Digit EPS Growth for Fiscal 2008 and Unveils New High-Performance Growth Plan for FY2009/2010
Full Year Financial Highlights
Full year FY08 sales grew 12%, driven by 6.9% organic growth (volume plus price). Organic sales rose 7% in North American Consumer Products, 8% in Europe and 19% in emerging markets.
FY08 Operating Income increased 8.5%.
Investments in consumer marketing and R&D grew by 15% and 17%, respectively.
EPS increased 11% for both Q4 and the full year, to $0.61 and $2.63, respectively.
Operating free cash flow of $895 million (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposal of PP&E) was up $17 million versus prior year.
FY08 was the final year in the two-year Superior Value & Growth Plan launched in June of 2006. Heinz exceeded the sales, operating income, EPS and cash flow goals set forth in that plan.
High-Performance Growth Plan for Fiscal 2009/2010
For Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2010, Heinz is raising its outlook to annual organic sales growth of 6%+ and EPS growth of 8% to 11%.
Emerging markets are targeted to grow in the high teens over the next two years.
The plan calls for 6% to 7% annual growth in operating income, while increasing the investment in marketing by $60 million to $100 million over the two-year period.
Annualized dividend raised to $1.66/share, an increase of 9.2%, for Fiscal 2009 and the Company anticipates a dividend payout ratio of around 60% for Fiscal 2010 (see separate press release).
PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--H. J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today reported strong earnings and sales growth for Fiscal 2008 as annual sales eclipsed $10 billion for the first time in the Companys history. Earnings per share rose 11% to $2.63 from $2.38 from continuing operations in the prior year and annual sales surged 12% to $10.1 billion driven by 14% growth in Heinz branded products, 26% growth in Weight Watchers and Weight Watchers Smart Ones brands, and 25% growth in emerging markets.
Operating income increased 8.5% to $1.57 billion as Heinz benefited from increased volume, improved pricing and productivity, and favorable currency exchange rates. Full-year net income from continuing operations increased 7% to $845 million.
Heinz once again delivered exceptional financial results in FY08 as we significantly increased sales, profits and operating free cash flow while also increasing marketing by 15% and introducing more than 200 new products, said William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. We achieved record sales growth of 12% to $10.1 billion, with sustained success in North American Consumer Products, increasingly strong performance in Europe and accelerating growth in emerging markets. Not only did we meet or exceed virtually all the goals we set for the past two years, but we have raised our outlook for sales and profits in our new High-Performance Plan for FY2009/2010.
Fiscal 2008 Results
During the year, Heinz increased its focus on fast-growing Health and Wellness products by adding functional benefits to many products and reducing salt, sugar and fat in others.
Fiscal 2008 sales increased by $1.1 billion, to $10.1 billion. Volume rose 3.6% as the Company increased its investments in marketing by 15% and in consumer-focused research and development by 17%. This focus on marketing, innovation and consumer value enabled the Company to realize price increases of 3.3% during the year. Coupled with productivity savings, the improved pricing helped Heinz partially offset the impact of commodity cost inflation, which is affecting all food manufacturers. Commodities increased over 8% in Fiscal 2008. Based on the Companys current projections and the global economic outlook, Heinz expects commodity inflation to continue at approximately the same rate for the next two years. Foreign exchange accounted for 5.1% of the sales growth in Fiscal 2008. Heinzs tax rate was higher than last year at 30.6%, versus 29.6% in Fiscal 2007.
Reflecting its new growth plan, Heinz announced today that it expects Fiscal 2009 earnings per share in the range of $2.83 to $2.91 (an increase of 8% to 11%).
FY2009/2010 High-Performance Plan
The new Heinz plan is focused on four strategic pillars:
1. Grow Heinz
s Core Portfolio
Heinz expects to drive 6%+ annual organic sales growth through increased marketing and R&D investments. Over the course of the plan, the Company expects to launch more than 400 new products supported by an incremental marketing investment of approximately $60 to $100 million and is targeting 15% of its annual revenue from products launched in the prior 36 months.
Heinz is expecting accelerated growth in Health & Wellness which is growing two times faster than all packaged foods. Heinz has one of the most Health & Wellness oriented portfolios in the food industry with a wide range of tomato sauces, baked beans, soup, low-calorie meals and infant nutrition.
2. Accelerate Growth in Emerging Markets
Heinz anticipates annual sales growth in the high teens in its fast-growing emerging markets, accelerating to approximately 20% of the Companys sales within five years.
Heinz plans to leverage its strong manufacturing, distribution and sales infrastructure to drive market penetration and brand awareness, with a focus on reaching the growing middle class in these markets. With experienced management teams in place and unique distribution capabilities in countries such as China and India, Heinz anticipates making additional investments in R&D, marketing and capacity expansion.
3. Strengthen & Leverage Global Scale
Heinz plans to leverage its global supply chain to identify more cost-saving opportunities and further optimize the Companys manufacturing and distribution infrastructure. Consequently, Heinz expects to exit an additional five to six factories over the next two years. Heinz expects $400 million in supply chain productivity over the next two years and an increase in ROIC of 20 basis points.
Heinz plans to launch hundreds of renewable energy and water conservation initiatives under its recently announced Sustainability Goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2015.
4. Make Talent an Advantage
With one of the best teams in the packaged food industry, Heinzs goal is to continue to enhance its global talent base. The Company is pursuing numerous initiatives in retention, recruitment and career advancement to ensure people remain a competitive advantage for Heinz. Importantly, Heinzs reward system balances short and long-term goals in sales, operating income, EPS and operating free cash flow, return on invested capital and total shareholder return.
FULL YEAR SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS
NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS
Sales and operating income of the North American Consumer Products segment grew significantly, up 10% and 8%, respectively. Organic sales (volume plus price) grew 7%, with volume up 3.5%, due primarily tofrozen entrees and desserts frozen entrees and  pasta sauces. The  volume performance was driven by successful new product introductions like Anytime Selections, Fruit Inspirations and various dessert items, as well as the impact of the launch of  products into Canada. The improvements were mainly driven by new products and increased consumption, and the success in was primarily due to new products as well as increased promotions in Canada. These volume improvements were partially offset by frozen potatoes, reflecting the timing of price increases taken during both Q4 last year and Q3 this year. Overall, price increases taken to partially offset commodity cost pressures resulted in price gains of 3.5%. The prior year acquisition of Renees Gourmet Foods in Canada increased sales 0.7% and favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 2.2%.

Ore-Ida
Operating income increased 8.4% as strong top-line growth, favorable foreign exchange, favorable mix and productivity improvements more than offset increased commodity costs and selling and distribution costs.
EUROPE
Heinz Europe posted strong sales and operating income growth of 15% and 12%, respectively. Organic sales surged 7.8% driven by solid volume growth of 4.5% and price of 3.3%. The volume increase was principally due to strong performance on Ketchup across Europe, soup, beans and pasta meals in the UK, products in Poland, and sauces and condiments in Russia. Volume also benefited from new product introductions across Continental Europe, such as  Big Soups in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Net pricing increased mainly from commodity-related price increases onKetchup and soup, the majority of the products in our Russian market and Italian infant nutrition products. Price was also favorable due to promotional timing on  beans. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 1.4% and favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 8.5%.

Heinz
Operating income increased 12.4%, reflecting improved pricing and volume and the favorable impact of exchange translation rates and reductions in G&A. These improvements were partially offset by increased commodity costs, higher manufacturing costs in our UK, European frozen and Netherlands businesses and increased marketing spending in support of our strong brands across Europe.
ASIA/PACIFIC
Heinz Asia/Pacific continued to drive very strong growth in sales and operating income, up 21% and 30%, respectively. Organic sales increased 9.3%, benefiting from a 6.5% volume improvement. The volume increase reflected significant improvements across the majority of the businesses, particularly Australia, India and China, related primarily to new product introductions and a 35% increase in marketing. Pricing increased 2.8%, due to increases on soy sauce and beverages in Indonesia, frozen products in China and nutritional products in India. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 1.6%, and favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 10.4%.
Long Fong
Operating income increased 29.8% due to sales growth, favorable mix, and foreign exchange partially offset by increased commodity costs and increased marketing expense from investment in our brands.
U.S. FOODSERVICE
U.S. Foodservice sales increased 0.2% with pricing up 1.7% as commodity costs continue to disproportionately impact the foodservice business. Volume decreased by 1.1%, reflecting softness in the U.S. restaurant business. Divestitures reduced sales 0.4%.
Operating income decreased 21.5% due to increased commodity costs, along with expenses incurred in anticipation of a plant closure in the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, partially offset by increased pricing and productivity.
Heinz is simplifying its U.S. Foodservice business, while increasing the level of innovation in its unique foodservice brands. The Company expects more profitable growth in this segment as macroeconomic conditions improve.
REST OF WORLD
Sales for Rest of World increased an impressive 18.7%, driven by organic sales growth of 19.9%. Volume increased 6.3% due primarily to increased demand for the Companys products in Latin America, as well as strong performance across our Middle East business. Higher pricing was driven by commodity cost increases which increased sales by 13.6%. Divestitures reduced growth 1.7% and favorable foreign exchange increased sales 0.6%.
Operating income increased 15.1%, due mainly to increased pricing, higher volume and improved business mix, partially offset by increased commodity costs.
Fourth Quarter Highlights
Solid fourth quarter results rounded out the end of this strong fiscal year with sales up 11.3%, driven by a 12% increase in Heinzs top 15 brands. The Heinz brand grew 16% overall led by organic sales of 10.5% for the quarter. Pricing increased 4.5% as significant improvements were noted in all of the Companys reportable segments. Price increases were taken throughout the fiscal year across the portfolio to help mitigate commodity cost increases. Volume improved 1.2%, led by Heinz businesses in the UK, Australia and Canada, partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice, Italian Infant Nutrition and U.S. Consumer Products. In the U.S. Consumer Products business, Smart Ones Meals showed strong growth but the overall volume performance of the segment was impacted by the timing of Ore-Ida price increases during both Q4 last year and Q3 this year. Excluding these increases, sales in the North American Consumer Products business would have been in line with previous quarters. Volume growth for North American Consumer Products is expected to normalize in the first quarter of FY09.
Operating income increased 2.0% as the Company invested significantly in marketing, streamlining, and in global Task Forces to drive future productivity savings. The operating income growth, combined with lower net interest expense and an effective tax rate of 34.3% (versus 35.8% last year) resulted in a 7.2% increase in net income to $194 million from $181 million in the same period last year. EPS increased 11% to 61 cents from 55 cents last year.
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
