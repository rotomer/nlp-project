GENERAL
ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Attached is H. J. Heinz Companys press release dated May 28, 2009 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
This press release presents the business measure of organic sales growth, which is defined as either volume plus price or total sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. This measure is utilized by senior management to provide investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis.
This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow, which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment.  This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, including the progress of management to profitably monetize low return assets.
The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures and cash received from disposals of property, plant and equipment, the net of which is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows.
This press release also presents certain reported amounts and certain outlook on a constant currency basis. Constant currency is defined as the reported amount adjusted for translation (the effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding prior year), the impact of the fluctuation in the British Pound versus the Euro and U.S. Dollar cross rates on transaction costs (impact of currency on particular transactions such as raw material sourcing), and the $107MM impact of Fiscal 2009 currency translation hedges.  Management refers to growth rates at constant currency so that results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of financial results. Management provides outlook on a constant currency basis because of the volatility of foreign exchange rates and because it believes that such presentation facilitates a period to period comparison.   However, a limitation of the use of the constant currency results as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on financial results when comparing to the prior period. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.
Disclosed on Exhibit 99.1 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the fourth quarters and fiscal years ended April 29, 2009 and April 30, 2008, respectively.

PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 28, 2009--The H. J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today reported record sales and profit for Fiscal 2009 with 10.3% growth in earnings per share and 9.2% growth in net income. Organic sales increased 5.5%, led by strong performances in Emerging Markets, a key growth driver, and North American Consumer Products. The Company benefited from higher sales of Heinz Ketchup, Classico pasta sauces, Complan nutritional beverages and other leading brands as the consumer trend of at-home eating accelerated in response to the global recession.
Heinz delivered record sales and profit in Fiscal 2009 despite the difficult global environment, said William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and CEO. Heinz brands around the world performed well, benefitting from the growing trend of at-home dining.
Fiscal 2009 Financial Results
Sales in Emerging Markets grew 8.8% on a reported basis and 15.7% on an organic basis, propelled by double-digit organic sales growth in India, Indonesia, Latin America, Poland and baby food in China. In Russia, the worlds second-largest ketchup market, Heinz has become the leader in the Ketchup, Condiments & Sauces category. In India, sales of Complan have doubled over the past three years and are nearing $100 million.
Emerging Markets are a key driver of long-term growth for Heinz and they remain on target to generate 20% of our total sales by 2013, Mr. Johnson said.
Heinz achieved organic sales growth in North American Consumer Products, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Rest of World. Total sales in Fiscal 2009 grew to a record $10.15 billion from $10.07 billion the prior year. Sales grew on a constant currency basis by 7.4% in Fiscal 2009; however, reported sales were reduced by approximately $665 million due to unfavorable translation rates in international markets. In addition, the decline in restaurant traffic continued to impact the Companys U.S. Foodservice business. About 60% of Heinzs sales and the majority of the Companys profit in Fiscal 2009 were generated outside the U.S.
Reported Operating Income declined 4.8% to $1.49 billion due to the negative impact of currency translation (7.7%) and transaction currency cross rates costs in the UK (2.8%). On a constant currency basis, operating income increased 5.7%. Below operating income, Heinz was able to offset almost 90% of the translation currency impact on operating income through currency translation hedging contracts. Fiscal 2009 also included a mark-to-market $20 million gain on the total return swap related to dealer remarketable securities, offsetting much of the additional cost of that debt in Fiscal 2009. Heinz also had a lower tax rate of 28.8%.
In the fiscal year ended April 29, 2009, earnings per share rose to $2.90, from $2.63 a year ago. Full-year net income increased to $923 million.
Heinz reported Operating Free Cash Flow of $880 million, after making an incremental $65 million discretionary pension payment.
Fiscal 2010 Outlook
Heinz is well positioned for future growth, with strong category-leading brands and core businesses that continue to perform well in this changing environment, Mr. Johnson said. We expect to deliver solid EPS and sales growth on a constant currency basis in Fiscal 2010, however, our reported results will likely be affected by unprecedented currency volatility.
On a constant currency basis:
Heinz expects sales growth of 4 to 6%
Heinz anticipates 6 to 8% growth in Operating Income
Heinz projects EPS growth of 5 to 8%
On a reported basis:
Based on recent average currency rates, EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 for the year.
The Company is projecting Operating Free Cash Flow of $850 to $900 million.
Heinz will continue to execute the strategy that has generated excellent results over the last three years, with a planned 7 to 10% increase in brand-building marketing investments in Fiscal 2010 (on a constant currency basis) and a heightened emphasis on cost control and global productivity. Heinz has a target of $250 million in productivity savings in Fiscal 2010.
Heinz Increases Dividend
Following its strong performance in Fiscal 2009, Heinz today announced that it will increase its annualized common stock dividend in Fiscal 2010 by 2 cents, to $1.68 from $1.66. Heinz has increased the dividend by 56% since adjusting it for the Del Monte spinoff in December 2002.
Mr. Johnson said, This dividend increase reflects the ongoing confidence of management and the Heinz Board of Directors in the future of Heinz. We have world-class brands, a proven plan that is delivering growth in our core businesses and Emerging Markets, excellent Cash Flow and one of the best teams in the industry.
Fiscal 2009 Full-Year Segment Highlights
North American Consumer Products
Organic sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 6.4%, while reported sales rose 4.1%. New products such as Ore-Ida Steam n Mash potatoes and pricing drove the growth. Net prices grew 6.8% reflecting increases taken across the majority of the product portfolio to help offset higher commodity costs. Volume was relatively flat (-0.4%). Unfavorable Canadian exchange translation rates decreased sales 2.3%. Operating income increased 6.8% due to higher pricing and an improved operating margin.
TM
Europe
Organic sales in Europe increased 6.1%, while reported sales declined 3.4% due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Net pricing increased 7.1%, driven by Heinz Ketchup, beans and soup, broad-based increases in Heinz's Russian business, frozen products in the UK and Italian infant nutrition. Volume declined slightly, down 1% reflecting lower sales in the UK frozen business. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 2.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of the Bndicta sauce business in France during the second quarter of this year and the Wyko sauce business in the Netherlands at the end of Fiscal 2008. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 12%.
Heinz Europe sales and profits reflect an almost 12% unfavorable impact this year from translation, and another 7% from UK cross currency transaction movements. As a result, operating income declined 11.9%; however, on a constant currency basis, operating income would have increased 7%.
Asia/Pacific
Heinz Asia/Pacific organic sales increased 4.7% and reported sales rose 1.7%. Pricing increased 6.1%, due primarily to increases in sardines and ABC sauces and syrup in Indonesia and improved pricing across almost all categories in Australia and New Zealand. Volume decreased modestly, down 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales 6.8%, due to the third-quarter acquisitions of Golden Circle Limited, a leading fruit and juice business in Australia, and La Bonne Cuisine, a chilled dip business in New Zealand. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 9.8%. Operating income decreased 6.4%, due to a 15.3% impact of currency translation.
U.S. Foodservice
Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased 3.4%. Pricing increased sales 3.5%, largely due to increases on Heinz Ketchup, portion control condiments, frozen soup and tomato products. Volume decreased by 6%, reflecting reduced restaurant traffic, Heinzs decision to exit lower-margin products and customers, and increased competition on Heinz's non-branded products. Divestitures reduced sales 0.9%. Operating income decreased 23.8% due primarily to lower volume, limited pricing and higher commodity and manufacturing costs.
Rest of World
Sales for Rest of World increased 27.3%, with organic growth of 32.2%. Volume increased 4.6% driven by increases in Latin America and the Middle East. Higher pricing increased sales by 27.6%, largely due to inflation in Latin America and commodity-related price increases in South Africa and the Middle East. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales 5.2%. Operating income increased 15.2%.
Fiscal 2009 Fourth-Quarter Results
Heinz reported 5.2% organic sales growth for the fourth quarter ended April 29, 2009. Reported sales declined 5.6% due to the impact of currency (-13.9%). Net pricing increased sales by 7.5%, as price increases were taken across the Companys portfolio to help offset increases in commodity costs. Volume decreased 2.3%, primarily due to a reduction in U.S. Foodservice volume related to declining restaurant sales, which more than offset strong volume growth in India and Continental Europe. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 3.1%. Heinz reported net income of $175 million. EPS of $0.55 came in at the high end of the Companys expected range.
