Safe Harbor Statement Please be aware that certain forward looking statements made during this meeting which are not historical facts, including any statements regarding the Company s targets, beliefs or expectations, are forward looking statements that are being made in an effort to assist you in understanding the Company and its results. Forward looking statements involve inherent risk and uncertainty. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in such statements. These risk factors are described in the Companys annual report on form 10 K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2009. The Company may also use pro-forma financial exhibits, which could differ from reported results using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Reasons for differences from GAAP versus non GAAP pro forma statements are that the latter typically exclude special charges, which are not expected to occur routinely in future periods. The Company uses the non GAAP financial exhibits internally to focus management on period to period changes in the Companys businesses and gauge our business operating performance. Management believes this information is also helpful to investors in understanding trends in the business. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to non GAAP financial measures are set forth in both the slides accompanying these presentations and the Form 8 K and its exhibits furnished to the SEC in connection with the Companys current earnings release and the earnings releases for fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 which are posted at www.heinz.com in the Heinz Newsroom. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date of the presentations and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of future events or otherwise, except as required by the securities laws. The majority of the following discussion will focus on earnings from continuing operations excluding special items in prior years.

Non-GAAP Performance Ratios H. J. Heinz Company and Subsidiaries Non-GAAP Performance Ratios The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Companys reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides the calculation of the non-GAAP performance rations discussed in this presentation.

Heinz Company Constant Currency Results The following tables reconcile the Company's reported results to constant currency results for both the current and prior year periods.
