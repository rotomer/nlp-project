GENERAL
ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Attached is H. J. Heinz Companys press release dated May 27, 2010 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
This press release presents the business measure of organic sales growth, which is defined as either volume plus price or total sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. This measure is utilized by senior management to provide investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis.
This press release also presents the business measure of operating free cash flow, which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment.  This measure is utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, including the progress of management to profitably monetize low return assets.
The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts for cash used for capital expenditures and cash received from disposals of property, plant and equipment, the net of which is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight to the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows.
This press release also presents certain reported amounts and certain outlook on a constant currency basis. Constant currency is defined as the reported amount adjusted for translation (the effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding prior year), the impact of the fluctuation in the British Pound versus the Euro and U.S. Dollar cross rates on U.K. transaction costs (impact of currency on particular transactions such as raw material sourcing), and the impact of current and prior year foreign currency translation hedges.  Management refers to growth rates at constant currency so that results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of financial results. Management provides outlook on a constant currency basis because of the volatility of foreign exchange rates and because it believes that such presentation facilitates a period-to-period comparison.   However, a limitation of the use of the constant currency results as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on financial results when comparing to the prior period. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.   
Disclosed on Exhibit 99.1 is supplemental information regarding reconciliation and calculation of the non-GAAP measures discussed above in connection with the financial results for the fourth quarters and fiscal years ended April 28, 2010 and April 29, 2009, respectively.
ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD
     Attached is H. J. Heinz Companys press release dated May 27, 2010 furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2 announcing an increase to the Companys dividend.
     Attached and furnished as Exhibit 99.3 is a five-year unaudited Summary of Financial Statements that is also being posted in connection with the Companys investor and analyst call on May 27, 2010.  This five-year summary reflects recast financial information which reports the operating results of the Kabobs frozen hors d'oeuvres business which was sold during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 as well as the Appetizers And, Inc. frozen hors doeuvres business and a private label frozen desserts business in the U.K., which were sold during the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, in discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Operating Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposal of Property, Plant & Equipment.

H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ) today reported excellent full-year and fourth-quarter results for Fiscal 2010 as the Company delivered dynamic double-digit organic sales growth in Emerging Markets. For the full year, sales grew 4.8% to a record $10.5 billion, operating income increased 3.8% and the Company generated record operating free cash flow of $1.08 billion while contributing over $500 million to its pension plans. Heinz delivered strong EPS of $2.87 from continuing operations despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations. EPS movement for the year was unfavorably impacted by $0.29 from net currency movements. The Companys return on invested capital reached 18.7%, one of the highest in its history, excluding the losses associated with discontinued operations.
Heinz Chairman, President and CEO William R. Johnson said: Heinz delivered strong profit with record sales and cash flow in Fiscal 2010 as our businesses and iconic brands around the world performed well in a challenging and volatile global environment. Heinzs Emerging Market businesses drove much of our growth, paced by outstanding performance in India, Indonesia, Russia, Latin America and the Middle East. Overall, it was another excellent year for Heinz as we significantly increased marketing and innovation to enhance our brand equity and drive volume growth in the second half after focusing on maintaining prior-year pricing to offset commodity inflation in the first half. Heinz improved gross profit margins, reflecting strong productivity gains, while also improving shareholder equity and return on invested capital.
The Companys strong financial performance in fiscal year 2010 was driven by 15.3% organic sales growth in Emerging Markets and 3.4% organic sales growth in its Top 15 brands. Heinz increased consumer marketing investments by over 25% and accelerated new product development. The Company improved gross profit margin by 50 basis points as it benefited from increased productivity and higher net pricing, which together more than offset commodity inflation.
Fiscal 2010 Full-Year Financial Results
 Continuing Operations
In the fiscal year ending April 28, 2010, Emerging Markets generated virtually all of the Companys organic sales growth, 30% of the Companys total reported sales growth and 15% of total Company sales. The robust growth in Emerging Markets was led by higher sales of Complan and Glucon D nutritional beverages in India, ABC products in Indonesia and significant growth in Heinz Ketchup and infant feeding products in Russia.
The Top 15 brands generated 70% of the Companys sales and performed well, with Heinz branded products growing organically 6.3% (5.4% reported). Heinz Ketchup sales continued to grow around the world, strengthening its position as the number-one brand in 7 of the worlds top 10 ketchup markets, including the United States. Across Europe, Ketchup achieved 9.5% organic sales growth (7.2% reported) and 6% volume growth for the year, led by robust growth in Russia, the worlds second-largest ketchup market.
Heinz delivered sales growth in all three of its core categories  Ketchup and Sauces, Meals and Snacks, and Infant/Nutrition  with total organic sales growth of 2.1% across its global portfolio.
Net pricing increased total sales by 3.4%, largely due to the carryover impact of price increases taken in Fiscal 2009 to help offset increased commodity costs.
Volume decreased 1.3%, as the Company focused primarily on generating strong profit and cash flow in the first half of the fiscal year in light of the poor economy and credit markets at the time. Volume was down 3.9% in the first half and up 1.4% in the second half. The modest full-year volume decline reflected lower volume in U.S. Foodservice and Australia. The second-half volume growth was led by increased volume in Emerging Markets and in U.S. and U.K. retail products, spurred by marketing and commercial initiatives that Heinz launched behind its brands, including the Consumer Value Program in the U.S. and It Has to be Heinz in the U.K.
Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 2.2%, primarily reflecting the addition of Golden Circlein Australia in Fiscal 2009. Overall, foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 0.5% compared with the prior year.
Gross profit grew 6.3% to $3.79 billion and gross margin increased by 50 basis points to 36.2%. The increase in gross margin reflected improved net pricing and strong productivity gains, which more than offset commodity inflation and the impact from foreign currency transaction cross-rates. Marketing spending increased by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales, while SG&A (excluding marketing expense) decreased by 10 basis points.
Operating income grew to $1.56 billion on higher pricing and improved productivity, partially offset by higher marketing investments and increased commodity costs. Operating income also reflected charges totaling $38 million for productivity initiatives, partially offset by a $15 million gain related to the sale of a factory in The Netherlands.
Net interest expense declined 9% to $251 million, reflecting lower average interest rates. Other expenses increased $111 million primarily due to prior-year foreign currency contract gains. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2010 was 27.8%, compared with 28.4% for the prior year.
Heinz reported net income of $914 million, or $2.87 per share, from continuing operations.
Fiscal 2010 Discontinued Operations
In the third quarter, the Company sold two businesses: Appetizers And, Inc., a frozen hors doeuvres business in the U.S. Foodservice segment, resulting in a $14.5 million pre-tax ($10.4 million after-tax) loss; and its private label frozen desserts business in the U.K., resulting in a $31.4 million pre-tax ($23.6 million after-tax) loss. In the second quarter, Heinz sold its Kabobs frozen hors doeuvres business, which was in the U.S. Foodservice segment, resulting in a $15.0 million pre-tax ($10.9 million after-tax) loss. The losses on each of these transactions have been recorded in discontinued operations. Overall, discontinued operations reduced total Company EPS by $0.16 for the year. Including discontinued operations, Heinz reported total net income of $865 million, or $2.71 per share.
Fiscal 2010 Fourth Quarter Results  Continuing Operations
In the fourth quarter, sales grew 8.3% to $2.72 billion, led by higher sales in Ketchup and Sauces, as marketing behind Heinzs leading brands increased 63% to drive growth. Heinz achieved its 20 consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, led by 21.1% organic sales growth in Emerging Markets, 4.0% organic sales growth in its Top 15 brands and higher volume in North American Consumer Products. Overall, volume grew 1.6%.
th
Global ketchup sales grew 7.7% on an organic basis (9.5% on a reported basis), led by Russia, Latin America, Egypt, the U.K., France, China and the Benelux market (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg). ABC soy sauces in Indonesia delivered strong sales growth and in China, the Companys Long Fong frozen dim sum business achieved double-digit organic sales growth. In India, sales of Complan and Glucon D nutritional beverages both increased at a double-digit rate. In the U.S., sales of Ore-Ida, the number-one brand of frozen potatoes, increased. Wet baby food delivered organic sales growth in Latin America and Italy, where the Companys Plasmon brand remained number-one.
Fourth-quarter operating income gained 1.9% to $345 million. Total Company EPS rose 9.1% to $0.60. Constant currency EPS from continuing operations was flat to prior year reflecting the Companys investment in marketing and productivity initiatives. Net income from continuing operations grew 7.6% to $193 million. Total Company net income increased 9.8% to $192 million.
Fiscal 2010  A Year of Innovation
To excite consumers and fuel growth, Heinz launched many innovative new products during the year. In the U.S., notable launches included Ore-Ida Sweet Potato Fries, Smart Ones mini-cheeseburger sliders and breakfast entrees, new varieties of T.G.I. Fridays Skillet Meals and Simply Heinz, a new variety of ketchup made with sugar. Heinz also announced the launch of Dip & Squeeze Ketchup, with the biggest innovation in foodservice ketchup packaging in decades. Dip & Squeeze Ketchup, with a dual-function package, is on track to reach the U.S. market later this year.
Around the world, Heinz introduced new Complan nutritional beverages for children in India, Mr. Jussie Milky beverages for children in Indonesia, Golden Circle LOL fizzy fruit juices and Raw branded chilled fruit and vegetable beverages in Australia, Reduced Sugar & Salt Snap Pot Heinz Beanz in the U.K. and Plasmon vegetable pouches for infants in Italy. Heinz also announced plans during the year to launch its first infant formula in China and Russia, two key Emerging Markets where the Companys growing Infant/Nutrition business is already well positioned.
Fiscal 2011 Outlook
On a constant currency basis, Heinz expects:
Sales growth of 3 to 4%
Operating Income growth of 7 to 10%
EPS growth of 7 to 10%
Operating free cash flow is expected to be more than $1 billion.
We expect another year of strong growth on a constant currency basis for Heinz in Fiscal 2011. Our outlook is based on robust plans for our brands and businesses. We continue to execute our proven strategy to grow our core portfolio, accelerate growth in Emerging Markets, leverage global scale and make talent an advantage, Mr. Johnson said. However, in this volatile economic environment, our reported results will likely be affected by significant currency fluctuations.
Heinz Raises Dividend
Reflecting the Companys strong cash flow and its excellent performance, Heinz today announced that it will increase its annualized common stock dividend in Fiscal 2011 by 12 cents, or 7.1%, to $1.80 from $1.68. Including this annualized increase, Heinz has now grown the dividend almost 67% over the last seven years for a compound annual growth rate of 7.6%.
FISCAL 2010 FULL-YEAR SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS
North American Consumer Products
Sales in North American Consumer Products increased 1.8% to $3.19 billion. Pricing grew 1.9% while volume decreased 1.5%, reflecting the Companys focus on profit and cash in the first half of the fiscal year, as well as category softness and competitive activity in weight management and frozen meals and desserts. Volume grew strongly in the second half, rising 3.6%, led by growth in Heinz Ketchup and new varieties of T.G.I. Fridays Skillet Meals, as Heinz increased consumer marketing and customer promotions. Favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales by 1.3%. Operating income increased 6.4%, reflecting gross profit improvement and reduced selling and distribution expenses, partially offset by increased marketing.
U.S. Foodservice
Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased 1.5% to $1.43 billion, reflecting the impact of the weak economy and high unemployment, which led to lower restaurant traffic, as well as SKU reductions to focus on core products. Pricing increased sales by 4.4%. Volume declined 5.5%, reflecting the trend of lower restaurant traffic. Prior-year divestitures reduced sales 0.4%. Operating income increased 16.4%, reflecting higher pricing and productivity and favorable commodity costs, which more than offset lower volume as Heinz continued to streamline and simplify the business and increased marketing investments.
Europe
In a difficult economy, sales in Europe rose 0.1% to $3.33 billion as net pricing gains of 2.4% were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates. Volume decreased 0.9%, primarily reflecting declines of frozen products in the U.K. and the exit of low margin products, particularly in France. Soup volume grew in the U.K. and Germany and Heinz Ketchup volume grew across Europe, led by strong growth in Russia. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 0.5%, reflecting the acquisition of the Bndicta Sauce business in Fiscal 2009. Operating income decreased 2.9%, due to cross currency rate movements in the British pound versus the euro and U.S. dollar and increased marketing investments.
Asia/Pacific
Sales in Asia/Pacific increased 23.3% to $2.01 billion. Pricing increased 2.0% and volume increased 1.0%. Complan and Glucon D nutritional beverages in India and ABC products in Indonesia reported strong growth while organic sales in Australia declined slightly. Acquisitions increased sales by 12.6% due to the prior-year acquisitions of Golden Circle in Australia and La Bonne Cuisine in New Zealand. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 7.8%. Operating income increased 7.0% on higher volume and pricing, productivity improvements and favorable foreign exchange translation rates, partially offset by higher commodities, SG&A from acquisitions and increased marketing investments.
Rest of World
Sales for Rest of World increased 14.0% to $533 million. Higher pricing increased sales by 23.1%, largely due to current and prior-year price increases in Latin America taken to mitigate inflation. Volume increased 2.3%, led by growth in Latin America and the Middle East. Acquisitions increased sales 0.8%. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales 12.2%, largely due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte (VEF) in the third quarter. Operating income increased 32.2% mainly due to pricing, partially offset by higher commodity costs, the impact of the VEF devaluation, higher marketing investments and costs reflecting inflation.
