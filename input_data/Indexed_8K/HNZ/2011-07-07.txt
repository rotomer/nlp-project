Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On June 30, 2011, H. J. Heinz Company (the "Company") and H. J. Heinz Finance Company ("Heinz Finance") entered into a senior unsecured, five-year credit agreement providing for a total revolving credit amount of $1.5 billion (the "Agreement"), with a group of lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. In addition, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated acted as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners for the Agreement, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and BNP Paribas, HSBC Bank USA N.A., Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., PNC Bank, National Association, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch and UBS Loan Finance LLC, as documentation agents.
The Agreement provides for a revolving credit line of $1.5 billion, and will be used to refinance or replace commitments under the Company's and Heinz Finance's Three-Year Credit Agreement dated as of April 29, 2009, to support the Company's commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. The commitments under the Agreement will terminate, and any amounts then outstanding will become due, on June 30, 2016.
Under the Agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain covenants, including an obligation to maintain a leverage ratio not in excess of 3.5 to 1. Borrowings under the Agreement are generally expected to be based on an applicable LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% per annum based on ratings of the Company's senior, unsecured long-term debt announced by relevant rating agencies. Under the Agreement, the banks will receive a facility fee that varies between 0.125% and 0.30%, similarly depending on the Company's senior, unsecured long-term debt rating. The Agreement also provides for loans funded on a competitive bid basis or based on a margin over an applicable "prime rate."
Certain lenders and agents under the Agreement (and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, cash management, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, trust, leasing services, foreign exchange and other advisory services to the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates, for such services.
The foregoing is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Agreement and not a complete discussion of the Agreement. Accordingly, the foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement attached to this Current Report as Exhibit 10.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 30, 2011, the Company and Heinz Finance terminated their existing $1.2 billion credit agreement that was due to expire on April 29, 2012. The terminated credit agreement was the Three-Year Credit Agreement dated as of April 29, 2009.

This opinion is being furnished pursuant to Section 3.01(b) of the Five-Year Credit Agreement (the "") dated as of June 30, 2011 among the Company, H.J. Heinz Finance Company (""), the banks listed on the signature pages thereof and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Company
Credit Agreement
Heinz Finance
I or one of the attorneys under my supervision have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. In this examination, I have relied on statements of fact contained in the documents I have examined, and I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as reproductions or certified copes and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
Based on the foregoing, and with due regard to such legal considerations as I deem relevant, and subject to the qualifications stated below, it is my opinion that:
1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and has all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted.
2. Heinz Finance is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted.
3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes executed and delivered by it are within the Company's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or, to the best of my knowledge, any applicable regulation, judgment, injunction, order, decree, material agreement or other material instrument binding upon the Company, or result in the creation or imposition of any Mortgage on any material asset of the Company.
4. The execution, delivery and performance by Heinz Finance of the Credit Agreement and the Notes executed and delivered by it are within Heinz Finance's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or the articles of incorporation or by-laws of Heinz Finance or, to the best of my knowledge, any applicable regulation, judgment, injunction, order, decree, material agreement or other material instrument binding upon Heinz Finance, or result in the creation or imposition of any Mortgage on any material asset of the Heinz Finance.
5. The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company and the Notes (if any) executed and delivered by it constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, in each case enforceable in accordance with their terms except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles.
6. The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Heinz Finance and the Notes executed and delivered by it constitute valid and binding obligations of Heinz Finance, in each case enforceable in accordance with their terms except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles.
7. To the best of my knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or overtly threatened in writing to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is (or would be) a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is (or would be) subject, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
8. In a properly presented case, a Pennsylvania court would give effect to the provisions of the Credit Agreement providing that the Credit Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
I am qualified to practice law in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. I have assumed for the purposes of providing my opinions in paragraphs 5 and 6 that the Credit Agreement and the Notes are governed by the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without my prior written consent.
