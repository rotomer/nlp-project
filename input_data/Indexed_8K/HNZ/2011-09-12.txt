(b)             Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the third and sixth paragraphs of text under the caption Underwriting in the Prospectus Supplement.
Indemnification of the Company.
(c)             If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the Indemnified Person) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the Indemnifying Person) in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7.  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a

reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d)             If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from th

and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e)             The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

10.           .  (a)  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement.  If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms.  If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes.  As used in this Agreement, the term Underwriter includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.

Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
 
 
 
 
 
Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.

as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in
Schedule 1 to the Underwriting Agreement referred to below
  
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for H.J. Heinz Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (the Company), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated September [], 2011 (the Underwriting Agreement) with you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule 1 thereto under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $[] aggregate principal amount of its []% Notes due 20[] and $[] aggregate principal amount of its []% Notes due 20[] (the Securities).  The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of July 15, 2008 (the Indenture) between the Company and Union Bank, N.A. (formerly known as Union Bank of California, N.A.), as trustee (the Trustee).
 
We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
 
We have also participated in the preparation of the Companys registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-176707) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the Incorporated Documents)) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) pursuant to the provisions of the Securities
 
 
 
 
 
Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), relating to the registration of securities (the Shelf Securities) to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated September 7, 2011 (the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement) relating to the Securities, the free writing prospectus dated September [], 2011 relating to the Securities, and the prospectus supplement dated September [], 2011 relating to the Securities (the Prospectus Supplement), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents.  The registration statement became effective under the Act and the Indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the Trust Indenture Act), upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on September 7, 2011 pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act.  The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the Registration Statement, and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated September [], 2011 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the Basic Prospectus.  The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the free writing prospectus set forth in Annex C to the Underwriting Agreement for the Securities are hereinafter called the Disclosure Package.  The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the Prospectus.
 
We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (EDGAR), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
 
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Securities are to be issued, provided that we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or state law.
 
 
 
 
 
We have considered the statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions Description of Debt Securities and Description of Notes insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Securities (the Offering Summary) and under the caption Material U.S. federal income tax consequences (the Tax Consequences Summary).  In our opinion, the Offering
 
 
 
 
 
Summary fairly summarizes the abovementioned provisions in all material respects and the statements in the Tax Consequences Summary insofar as they describe provisions of the U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto, fairly and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
 
In rendering the opinions in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, we have assumed that each party to the Documents has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, we have assumed that the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (1) are within its corporate powers, (2) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (3) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (4) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, and that each Document is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto, other than the Company.
 
We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and of the State of Delaware.

The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or quantitative information.

However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification.  We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.

(formerly known as Union Bank of California, N.A.), as Trustee (the Indenture).
I, or one of the attorneys under my supervision, have examined the Companys registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-176707) (the Registration Statement) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to the registration of securities to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated September  7, 2011 (the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement) relating to the Securities, the free writing prospectus dated September ___, 2011, and the
 
 
 
 
 
 
prospectus supplement dated September [, 2011 relating to the Securities (the Prospectus Supplement) (collectively, the Prospectus).

I, or one of the attorneys under my supervision, have examined the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Securities and the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein.  I, or one of the attorneys under my supervision, have examined originals or reproductions or certified copies of such other documents, records and papers, matters of law, statutes, decisions and regulations that I have deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with this opinion.  I have relied on statements of fact contained in the documents I have examined and I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as reproductions or certified copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.  Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms used herein have the meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
Whenever my opinion with respect to the existence or absence of facts or any other matter is indicated to be based on my knowledge or awareness, I am referring solely to my actual knowledge or the actual knowledge of the particular attorneys of the Company who have had substantive involvement in representing the Company in connection with the Prospectus, the Securities, the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, and the transactions contemplated thereby.  Except as expressly set forth herein, I have not undertaken any independent investigation whatsoever to determine the existence or absence of such facts or any other matter and have not undertaken or caused to be undertaken any review whatsoever of court filings or other public records, and no inference as to my knowledge concerning such facts or other matters should be drawn from the fact that such limited investigation has been undertaken by me.
Based on the foregoing, and with due regard to such legal considerations as I deem relevant, and subject to the qualifications stated below and in the last two paragraphs of this letter, it is my opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Company, or (iii) result in any violation of the provisions of any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, except such as may be required under federal or state securities laws or Blue Sky laws as to which I express no opinion, and except, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii) above, for any such conflict, breach, violation or default that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
 
I am qualified to practice law in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and I do not purport to be an expert on and do not express an opinion on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and the United States of America.  My opinion in paragraph (iv) above with respect to ProMark Brands Inc. is based solely on a certificate from the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Idaho.
This opinion is rendered to you in connection with the above described transactions. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without my prior written consent or as provided in the Underwriting Agreement.
