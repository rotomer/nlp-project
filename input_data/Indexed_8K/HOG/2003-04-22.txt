Financial Contact: Patrick Davidson (414) 343-8002 Media Contact: Kathleen Lawler (414) 343-4587 HARLEY-DAVIDSON REPORTS ANOTHER RECORD FIRST QUARTER Milwaukee, Wis., April 16, 2003 -- Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE: HDI) today announced record revenue and earnings for its first quarter ended March 30, 2003. Revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion compared with $927.8 million in the year-ago quarter, a 20.0 percent increase. First quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) were 61 cents, a 56.4 percent increase compared with last year's 39 cents. "We are pleased with our outstanding results for the first quarter of 2003 as we continue to execute our long-term Plan for Sustainable Growth," said Jeffrey L. Bleustein, chairman and chief executive officer of Harley-Davidson, Inc. "While the long winter experienced by much of our nation has delayed some retail sales, dealer confidence and other measures that we use to track Harley-Davidson motorcycle demand remain strong." "With these indicators in mind and with construction of our new factory in York, Pennsylvania proceeding to plan, we are raising our shipment target for 2003 from 289,000 to 290,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles," added Bleustein. The Company's new target is a 10% increase over 2002. Motorcycles and Related Products Segment First quarter revenue from Harley-Davidson motorcycles was $876.5 million, an increase of 17.2 percent over the first quarter last year. Shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles totaled 70,608 units, up 5,939 units or 9.2 percent over last year. First quarter revenue from Parts and Accessories (P&A), which consists of Genuine Motor Parts(TM) and Genuine Motor Accessories(TM), totaled $159.8 million, a 21.9 percent increase over the year-ago quarter. Total P&A revenue includes $13.9 million from sales of 100th Anniversary P&A products sold during the quarter. Shipments of 100th Anniversary P&A products will continue through the second quarter. For the second half of 2003, the Company expects P&A revenues to grow at a rate slightly faster than the motorcycle unit growth rate. General Merchandise, which consists of MotorClothes(R) apparel and collectibles, had first quarter revenue of $56.5 million, up 33.6 percent over the same period last year, with revenue from 100th Anniversary General Merchandise products accounting for $8.3 million. Shipments of 100th Anniversary products in this product line are now essentially complete, and therefore General Merchandise revenue for the remainder of the year is expected to be lower than in 2002. First quarter gross margin for the Motorcycles and Related Products Segment was 36.2 percent of revenue compared to 34.0 percent in the first quarter of last year. First quarter gross margin was favorably impacted by wholesale motorcycle price increases and a richer product mix that were associated with 100th Anniversary product lines. Additional favorability was realized from foreign currency exchange rates. Consistent with the higher gross margin, operating margin increased from 18.7 percent in 2002 to 21.5 percent in 2003.

Retail Sales Data Harley-Davidson retail motorcycle sales for the quarter were down 3.2 percent in the U.S., but up 15.7 percent in Europe and up 12.9 percent in Japan compared to the same period last year. "While retail sales for the United States were lower in the first three months of the year, we and our independent dealer network believe that many customers have delayed purchasing their motorcycles until the weather improves. We look forward to the spring riding season kicking into gear," said Bleustein. Data is listed in the accompanying tables. Financial Services Segment Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Inc. (HDFS), a subsidiary of Harley-Davidson, Inc., reported operating income of $43.4 million, up $31.2 million compared to the year-ago quarter. The subsidiary benefited from its previously announced plan to securitize retail installment loans for Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the first quarter of 2003. HDFS sold $550 million in motorcycle loans during the quarter and recorded a gain of $26.4 million. The subsidiary realized a larger than expected gain on this sale due to a favorable interest rate environment and a larger transaction size. This compares with a gain of $5.0 million on $93 million of loans securitized during the first quarter of 2002, which was the remaining portion of the fourth quarter 2001 securitization. Based on anticipated interest rates and the competitive financial services environment, the Company expects HDFS' full year 2003 operating income to be approximately 25 percent higher than in 2002. Over the longer term, the Company expects the HDFS growth rate to be slightly higher than the Company's motorcycle unit growth rate. Cash Flow Operations generated cash of more than $311 million. The Company invested $41.8 million in capital expenditures and paid a dividend of $10.6 million. Share Repurchase During the quarter, the Company repurchased 500,000 shares of its common stock.
