        Milwaukee, Wis., January 20, 2005  Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE: HDI) today announced record revenue and earnings for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. Revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion compared with $1.16 billion in the year-ago quarter, a 5.4 percent increase. Net income for the quarter was $209.0 million compared to $182.4 million, an increase of 14.5 percent over 2003. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) was 71 cents, an 18.3 percent increase compared with last year's 60 cents.
        Revenue for the full year was $5.02 billion, compared with $4.62 billion in 2003, an 8.5 percent increase. Net income for the year was $889.8 million, a 16.9 percent increase versus last year's $760.9 million, while diluted EPS for the full year was $3.00, a 20.0 percent increase compared with $2.50 in 2003.
        "Once again Harley-Davidson achieved record revenue and earnings, making 2004 the nineteenth consecutive record year for the Company," said Jeffrey L. Bleustein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We focused on exceeding the impressive results of our 100 Anniversary year by increasing motorcycle availability to improve customer satisfaction and by stimulating interest among prospective customers. U.S. retail sales for Harley-Davidson motorcycles increased more than 7 percent over last year, demonstrating that the dream of owning a Harley-Davidson motorcycle remains extremely powerful," said Bleustein.
th
        "Our fourth quarter retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were up 6.7 percent in the U.S. over the same period in 2003 and up 14 percent in international markets," he said.
        "We expect to continue to grow in 2005 and ship 339,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycles during the year to support that growth. This is consistent with our established goals of satisfying demand for 400,000 motorcycles in 2007 and generating an annual earnings growth rate in the mid-teens," said Bleustein.
Motorcycles and Related Products Segment  Fourth Quarter Results
        Revenue from Harley-Davidson motorcycles was $992.6 million, an increase of $47.3 million or 5.0 percent over the same period last year. Shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles totaled 80,587 units, an increase of 3,531 units or 4.6 percent over last year's fourth quarter.
        Revenue from Parts and Accessories (P&A), which consists of Genuine Motor Parts and Genuine Motor Accessories, totaled $157.9 million, an increase of $16.9 million, or 12.0 percent over the year-ago quarter. Revenue from General Merchandise, which consists of MotorClothes apparel and collectibles, totaled $54.9 million, an increase of $4.2 million or 8.2 percent.
        Gross margin was 37.8 percent of revenue, up from 35.9 percent in the prior year. Gross margin was favorably impacted primarily by manufacturing efficiencies and foreign currency exchange rates. Consistent with the higher gross margin, operating margin increased from 21.5 percent in 2003 to 23.0 percent in 2004.
Motorcycle Retail Sales Data
        Retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles for the year 2004 grew 7.1 percent in the U.S. and 1.5 percent internationally compared with the prior year. Retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles grew in many of the Company's international markets. However, overall retail sales in Europe decreased 5.3 percent.
        "In response to the current market conditions and the strong Euro, Harley-Davidson is reducing suggested retail prices in 2005 on select motorcycle models in our European markets. This will make our motorcycles more affordable to a broader range of customers," said Bleustein.
Financial Services Segment
        Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Inc. (HDFS), a subsidiary of Harley-Davidson, Inc., reported fourth quarter operating income of $39.2 million, up $5.4 million or 15.9 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.
        The segment's performance was driven by continued strong marketplace acceptance of its finance and insurance products as well as positive foreign currency exchange.
        Annualized credit losses net of recoveries on a managed portfolio basis were 0.81 percent during the year. This is better than the Company's stated target of 1 percent.
Harley-Davidson, Inc.  Twelve Month Results
        For the fiscal year ended 2004, total Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments were 317,289 units compared with 291,147 units in 2003, a 9.0 percent increase. Harley-Davidson motorcycle revenue was $3.93 billion, an increase of $306.7 million or 8.5 percent.
        P&A revenue totaled $781.6 million, a $68.8 million or 9.7 percent increase, while General Merchandise revenue totaled $223.7 million, a $12.3 million or 5.8 percent increase compared with 2003.
        Full year operating income for HDFS was $188.6 million, an increase of $20.7 million or 12.3 percent compared to 2003.
Cash Flow  Twelve Month Results
        As of December 31, 2004, cash and marketable securities were $1.61 billion. During the year the Company invested $213.6 million in capital expenditures, repurchased 10.6 million shares of Company stock for $564.1 million, paid $119.2 million in dividends and increased cash and marketable securities by $289.4 million.
Stock Option Accounting
        In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new rules requiring companies to recognize the expense of stock option grants in their income statements. Although the new rules are not effective until the Company's third quarter of 2005, the Company will implement this change in accounting as of January 1, 2005. If the Company had elected to expense stock options in 2004 under the new standard, the effect would have been a $22.5 million pretax charge. The Company expects a similar charge in 2005.
2005 and Beyond
        In addition to the previously stated motorcycle unit shipment goal, the Company expects growth in all of its product lines. Harley-Davidson expects the growth rate for P&A revenues to be slightly higher than the motorcycle unit growth rate, and the General Merchandise growth rate is expected to be lower than the motorcycle unit growth rate. The Company expects the HDFS growth rate to be slightly higher than the Company's motorcycle unit growth rate.
