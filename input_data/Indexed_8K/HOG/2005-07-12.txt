Other Events
        On April 13, 2005, Harley-Davidson, Inc. announced that it was limiting short-term production growth and planned to increase motorcycle shipments from last year's 317,000 units to a target of 329,000 units compared to its original target of 339,000 units. After that announcement, a number of shareholder complaints, including some purporting to be class action complaints, were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On July 11, 2005, the staff of the Enforcement Division of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") advised the Company that it is inquiring into matters relating generally to the Company's April 13, 2005 announcement and certain allegations contained in the shareholder complaints. In light of the pending shareholder litigation, the Company was not surprised by the SEC's inquiry. The Company is cooperating with the SEC.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
