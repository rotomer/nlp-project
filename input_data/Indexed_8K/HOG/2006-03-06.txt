Mr. Bergmann commenced his employment, and the Company announced his appointment, on March 6, 2006. Mr. Bergmann succeeds James L. Ziemer as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Ziemer was elected as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President on April 30, 2005. James M. Brostowitz, who had been serving as the Company's Acting Chief Financial Officer since April 30, 2005 (to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Ziemer's election to Chief Executive Officer and President), will continue to serve as the Company's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer.
        Mr. Bergmann most recently served as Interim Chief Executive Officer of USF Corporation ("USF"), a $2.5 billion transportation and logistics company, a position he held from November 2004 to June 2005.

Prior to that, Mr. Bergmann served as Executive Vice President of USF from August 2004 to November 2004 and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of USF from February 2004 to August 2004.

        On March 6, 2006, the Company entered into a Severance Benefits Agreement and a Transition Agreement with Mr. Bergmann upon his election as the Company's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and the commencement of his employment with the Company.

The Transition Agreement becomes effective upon a change of control of the Company (as defined in the Transition Agreement). It provides for certain benefits upon the termination of Mr. Bergmann's employment following a change of control.
