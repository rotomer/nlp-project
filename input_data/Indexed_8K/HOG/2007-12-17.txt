        "London Banking Day" means a day which commercial banks are open for business, including dealings in United States dollars, in London.
Provisions Applicable To Fixed Rate Notes Only:
        If the "Fixed Rate" line above is checked, unless otherwise specified above, the Company will pay interest semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year (each such date fixed for the payment of interest, an "Interest Payment Date") commencing June 15, 2008, and on the Maturity Date or upon earlier redemption or repayment to the person to whom principal is payable. Interest shall accrue from the Original Issue Date, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on this Note to, but excluding, the next following Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, or earlier date of redemption or repayment, as the case may be. Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
        If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or the date of earlier redemption or repayment) of this Fixed Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment will be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or the date of earlier redemption or repayment), as the case may be.
Provisions Applicable To Floating Rate Notes Only:
        If the "Floating Rate" line above is checked, the Company will pay interest on the Interest Payment Dates shown specified above at the Initial Interest Rate specified above until the Initial Interest Reset Date specified above following the Original Issue Date specified above and thereafter at a rate determined in accordance with the provisions hereinafter set forth under the headings "Determination of CD Rate," "Determination of CMT Rate," "Determination of Commercial Paper Rate," "Determination of Federal Funds Rate," "Determination of LIBOR," "Determination of Prime Rate" or "Determination of Treasury Rate," depending on whether the Interest Rate Basis is the CD Rate, the CMT Rate, the Commercial Paper Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, the Prime Rate, the Treasury Rate or other Interest Rate Basis.
        An interest payment shall be the amount of interest accrued from and including the Original Issue Date, or from and including the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid, to, but excluding, the next following Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, or date of earlier redemption or repayment, as the case may be (an "Interest Period"). Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified above.
        If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note, other than an Interest Payment Date at maturity, would fall on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date will be the following day that is a Business Day, and interest will continue to accrue to the following Business Day, except that if LIBOR is the applicable Interest Rate Basis, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day. If the Maturity Date (or date of earlier redemption or repayment) of any Floating Rate Note would fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal (and premium, if any) may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date (or the date of earlier redemption or repayment).
        Commencing with the first Interest Reset Date specified above following the Original Issue Date, the rate at which interest on this Note is payable shall be adjusted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually as specified above under "Interest Reset Dates."
        The interest rate borne by this Note will be determined as follows:
        (i)        Unless the Interest Category of this Note is specified above as a "Floating Rate/Fixed Rate Note" or an "Inverse Floating Rate Note" or in the event either "Other Provisions" or an Addendum hereto applies, in each case, relating to a different interest rate formula, this Note shall be designated as a "Regular Floating Rate Note" and, except as set forth below or specified above under "Other Provisions" or in an Addendum hereto, shall bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the applicable Interest Rate Basis or Bases (a) plus or minus the applicable Spread, if any, and/or (b) multiplied by the applicable Spread Multiplier, if any; in each case as specified above. Commencing on the Initial Interest Reset Date, the rate at which interest on this Note shall be payable shall be reset as of each Interest Reset Date specified above; , that the interest rate in effect for the period, if any, from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate.
provided, however
        (ii)        If the Interest Category of this Note is specified above as a "Floating Rate/Fixed Rate Note" then, except as set forth below or specified above under "Other Provisions" or in an Addendum hereto, this Note shall bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the applicable Interest Rate Basis or Bases (a) plus or minus the applicable Spread, if any, and/or (b) multiplied by the Spread Multiplier, if any, in each case as specified above. Commencing on the Initial Interest Reset Date, the rate at which interest on this Note shall be payable shall be reset as of each Interest Reset Date; , , that (y) the interest rate in effect for the period, if any, from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate and (z) the interest rate in effect for the period commencing on, and including, the Fixed Rate Commencement Date specified above to the Maturity Date (or date of earlier redemption or repayment) shall be the Fixed Interest Rate specified above or, if no Fixed Interest Rate is so specified, the interest rate in effect on the day immediately preceding the Fixed Rate Commencement Date.
provided
however
        (iii)        If the Interest Category of this Note is specified above as an "Inverse Floating Rate Note" then, except as set forth below or specified above under "Other Provisions" or in an Addendum hereto, this Note shall bear interest at (a) the Fixed Interest Rate specified above minus (b) the rate determined by reference to the applicable Interest Rate Basis or Bases: (x) plus or minus the applicable Spread, if any, and/or (y) multiplied by the applicable Spread Multiplier, if any, in each case as specified above; , , that, unless otherwise specified above under "Other Provisions" or in an Addendum hereto, the interest rate hereon shall not be less than zero.
provided
however
        Commencing on the Initial Interest Reset Date, the rate at which interest on this Note shall be payable shall be reset on each Interest Reset Date; , , that the interest rate in effect for the period, if any, from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate set forth above.
provided
however
        The "Spread" is the number of basis points (one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point) specified above to be added to or subtracted from the Interest Rate Basis for a Floating Rate Note, and the "Spread Multiplier" is the percentage specified above by which the Interest Rate Basis for such Floating Rate Note will be multiplied to determine the applicable interest rate. Both a Spread and/or a Spread Multiplier may be applicable to the Interest Rate Basis for a particular Floating Rate Note, as set forth above.
        Each such adjusted Interest Rate Basis shall be applicable on and after the Interest Reset Date to which it relates but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date. If any Interest Reset Date is a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if the rate of interest on this Note shall be determined by reference to LIBOR and such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Subject to applicable provisions of law (including usury laws) and except as specified in this Note, on each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Note shall be the rate determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below.
        With respect to a Floating Rate Note, accrued interest shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount thereof by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period or from the last date from which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each such day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the cases of CD Rate Notes, Commercial Paper Rate Notes, Federal Funds Rate Notes, LIBOR Notes and Prime Rate Notes, or by the number of days in the year, in the cases of CMT Rate Notes and Treasury Rate Notes. The interest rate applicable to any day that is an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate effective on such Interest Reset Date. The interest rate applicable to any other day will be the interest rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date (or, if none, the Initial Interest Rate, as specified above).
        The "Calculation Date," where applicable, pertaining to an Interest Determination Date will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or the date of earlier redemption or repayment), as the case may be.
        The Trustee shall be the calculation agent unless another calculation agent is specified above (the "Calculation Agent"). The interest rate applicable to each interest period will be determined by the Calculation Agent on or prior to the applicable Calculation Date. At the request of the Holder, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date.
        All percentages resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest on a Floating Rate Note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent (.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
        . If the Interest Rate Basis, as specified above, is, or is calculated by reference to, the CD Rate, unless otherwise specified above, the "CD Rate" for each Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the second Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a "CD Interest Determination Date") and shall be the rate on the applicable CD Interest Determination Date for negotiable United States dollar certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified above as published in H.15(519) (as defined below) on such CD Interest Determination Date under the heading "CDs (secondary market)." If the rate referred to in the preceding sentence is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Calculation Date, the CD Rate shall be the rate on the applicable CD Interest Determination Date for negotiable United States dollar certificates of deposit of the Index Maturity specified above as published in H.15 Daily Update (as defined below), or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "CDs (secondary market)." If the rate referred to in the preceding sentence is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Calculation Date, the CD Rate shall be the rate on the applicable CD Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent on the Notes as the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the applicable CD Interest Determination Date, of three leading non-bank dealers in negotiable United States dollar certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable United States dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money market banks with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified above in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time. If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent as provided in the preceding sentence are not quoting as mentioned in such sentence, the CD Rate shall be the CD Rate in effect on the applicable CD Interest Determination Date.
Determination of CD Rate
        "H.15(519)" means the weekly statistical release designated as H.15(519), or any successor publication, published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

        . If the Interest Rate Basis, as specified above, is, or is calculated by reference to, the CMT Rate, unless otherwise specified above, the "CMT Rate" for each Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the second Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a "CMT Interest Determination Date") and shall be:
Determination of CMT Rate
        (i) if the Designated CMT Reuters Page (as defined below) is specified above as Reuters Page FRBCMT, the CMT Rate for such CMT Interest Determination Date will be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified above, as the yield is displayed on Reuters, Inc. (or any successor service), on page FRBCMT (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities") ("Reuters Page FRBCMT"), for the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date. If the rate referred to in the preceding sentence does not appear on Reuters Page FRBCMT, the CMT Rate for such CMT Interest Determination Date will be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified above, and for the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date as published in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities." In the event the rate referred to in the preceding sentence does not appear in H.15(519), then the CMT Rate for such CMT Interest Determination Date will be the rate on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date for the period of the Index Maturity specified above, as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate which would otherwise have been published in H.15(519). In the event the rate referred to in the preceding sentence is not published, the CMT Rate on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent as a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers in the United States of America, which may include an agent of the Company or such agent's affiliates (each a "Reference Dealer"), selected by the Calculation Agent (from five Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest), and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified above, a remaining term to maturity no more than one year shorter than the Index Maturity specified above and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the securities in the market at that time. If fewer than five but more than two of the prices referred to in the above sentence are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained, and neither the highest nor the lowest of the quotations shall be eliminated; , , that if fewer than three prices referred to above are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent as a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent from five Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation or, in the event of equality, one of the highest and the lowest quotation or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest, for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified above, and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified above, and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the securities in the market at that time. However, if fewer than five but more than two prices referred to above are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained, and neither the highest nor the lowest of the quotations will be eliminated. If fewer than three prices referred to above are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date will be the CMT Rate in effect on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date; and
provided
however
        (ii)  if the Designated CMT Reuters Page is specified above as Reuters Page FEDCMT, the CMT Rate for such CMT Interest Determination Date will be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified above, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified above, as such yield is displayed on Reuters, Inc. (or any successor service) on page FEDCMT (or any other page as may replace page FEDCMT on that service) ("Reuters Page FEDCMT"), for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which the related CMT Interest Determination Date falls. If the rate referred to in the preceding sentence does not appear on Reuters Page FEDCMT, then the CMT Rate for such CMT Interest Determination Date will be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified above, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified above, and for the week or month, as applicable, preceding the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date as published in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities." If the rate referred to in the preceding sentence does not appear in H.15(519), then the CMT Rate for such CMT Interest Determination Date will be the one-week or one-month, as specified above, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified above, as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately prior to the week or month, as applicable, in which the related CMT Interest Determination Date falls. If the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not publish the rate referred to in the preceding sentence, the CMT Rate on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent as a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (from five Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest), and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified above, and a remaining term to maturity no more than one year shorter than the Index Maturity specified above, and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the securities in the market at that time. If fewer than five but more than two of the prices referred to above are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained, and neither the highest nor the lowest of the quotations shall be eliminated. If fewer than three prices referred to above are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent as a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (from five Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation or (in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified above, and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified above and will be in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the securities in the market at that time. If fewer than five but more than two prices referred to above are provided as requested, the CMT Rate will be calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained, and neither the highest nor the lowest of the quotations will be eliminated. If fewer than three prices referred to above are provided as requested, the CMT Rate will be the CMT Rate in effect on the applicable CMT Interest Determination Date. If two United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity as specified above have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Index Maturity specified above, the quotes for the United States Treasury security with the shorter original remaining term to maturity will be used.
        "Designated CMT Reuters Page" means the display on Reuters, Inc. or any successor service on the page specified above (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service for the purpose of displaying Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519)).

If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUND 01, or is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate on the applicable Federal Funds Interest Determination Date for United States dollar federal funds will be the rate on such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update, or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption "Federal Funds/Effective Rate." If such rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in the City of New York, which may include an agent of the Company or such agent's affiliates, selected by the Calculation Agent before 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the applicable Federal Funds Interest Determination Date; , , that if the brokers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate will be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on the applicable Federal Funds Interest Determination Date.

If on a LIBOR Interest Determination Date, such rate does not appear on Reuters LIBOR01 at such time, or if Reuters LIBOR01 is not available on such date, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg's page "BBAM." If such rate does not appear on Reuters LIBOR01 or Bloomberg's page "BBAM" on a LIBOR Interest Determination Date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide a quotation of the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market for three-month deposits in United States dollars in a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.

        Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to the Holder hereof at its address as such address shall appear in the Security Register of the Company. If less than all of the Notes with like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the principal amount of this Note called for redemption.
        If an HDI Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem this Note as described above, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes on the terms set forth herein.

The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the HDI Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the HDI Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
        On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, (i) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (ii) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with a Company Officers' Certificate (as defined in the Indenture) stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.

        "HDI Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than HDI or one of its subsidiaries, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of HDI or other Voting Stock into which the Voting Stock of HDI is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (2) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of HDI and the assets of the subsidiaries of HDI, taken as a whole, to one or more "persons" (as that term is defined in the Indenture), other than HDI or one of its subsidiaries; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of HDI are not Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to be an HDI Change of Control if (1) HDI becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Voting Stock of HDI immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.
