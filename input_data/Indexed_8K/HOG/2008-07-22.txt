ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
        On July 16, 2008, Harley-Davidson, Inc. (the "Company"), its subsidiary Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Inc. ("HDFS") and certain other subsidiaries entered into new bank credit facilities totaling $1.9 billion which replace existing bank credit facilities of $1.7 billion. The new facilities are comprised of a $950 million, 364-day facility (the "364-Day Credit Facility") and a $950 million, 3-year facility (the "3-Year Credit Facility" and, together with the 364-Day Credit Facility, the "New Credit Facilities"). HDFS has historically used credit facilities to support HDFS' commercial paper program and to fund HDFS' lending activities and other operations. The New Credit Facilities enable HDFS to issue up to $1.9 billion in unsecured commercial paper. Outstanding commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the credit facilities. As a result, the combined total of commercial paper and borrowings under the New Credit Facilities may not exceed $1.9 billion.
        Each of the New Credit Facilities is among the Company, as a borrower, HDFS and other subsidiaries as borrowers or guarantors, various financial institutions party thereto as lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The New Credit Facilities replace (i) a Credit Agreement dated as of September 16, 2004 (the "Existing 2004 Credit Facility") involving HDFS and other subsidiaries as borrowers or guarantors that provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate availability of $1.4 billion and was to mature in September 2009, and (ii) a Credit Agreement dated as of February 20, 2008 (the "Existing 2008 Credit Facility") involving HDFS and other subsidiaries as borrowers or guarantors that provided for an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate availability of $300 million and was to mature in December 2008. The outstanding principal balance under the Existing 2004 Credit Facility was approximately $225 million (Canadian), which amount was refinanced under the 3-Year Credit Facility. There was no outstanding principal balance under the Existing 2008 Credit Facility.
        The 3-Year Credit Facility provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in July 2011, and the 364-Day Credit Facility provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in July 2009. The Company may increase the aggregate amount of availability under each revolving credit facility to up to $1.2 billion (providing aggregate availability of $2.4 billion) if certain conditions (including lender approval) are satisfied.
        Borrowings under each New Credit Facility will bear interest at various variable rates, which may be adjusted upward or downward depending on whether certain criteria are satisfied. Each New Credit Facility also requires the Company to pay a fee based upon the average daily unused portion of the aggregate commitments under such New Credit Facility.
        Each New Credit Facility contains various restrictions and covenants, including requirements that the Company and its subsidiaries maintain certain financial ratios at prescribed levels (as described in the following sentence) and restrictions on the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to consolidate or merge or create liens. Each New Credit Facility requires (i) HDFS to, as of the end of any fiscal month, maintain a minimum consolidated shareholder's equity net of intangible assets of $300,000,000, (ii) HDFS and its consolidated subsidiaries to, as of the end of any fiscal month, maintain a ratio of (A) consolidated indebtedness (excluding certain subordinated and intercompany indebtedness) to (B) the sum of consolidated shareholder's equity net of intangible assets, preferred stock and certain subordinated indebtedness no greater than 10.00 to 1.00 and (iii) the Company to maintain a ratio of (A) consolidated net income plus consolidated interest expense, taxes on or measured by income, depreciation expense and amortization expense (subject to certain other adjustments) to (B) consolidated interest expense, as of the end of any fiscal quarter for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, of at least 2.50 to 1.00.
        Each New Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under either New Credit Facility occurs and is continuing, then the interest rate on all obligations under such New Credit Facility may be increased above the otherwise applicable rate and the lenders under such New Credit Facility may terminate their commitments and declare any outstanding obligations under such New Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.
        The description of the 3-Year Credit Facility and the 364-Day Credit Facility, respectively, set forth above is qualified by reference to such New Credit Facilities filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

If any fee shall be charged by the Lenders in connection with any such increase, such fee shall be in accordance with then prevailing market conditions, which market conditions shall have been reasonably documented by the Global Administrative Agent to Harley. No less than two (2) Business Days prior to the effective date of the increase of the Aggregate Commitment, the Global Administrative Agent shall notify Harley of the amount of the fee to be charged by the Lenders, and Harley may, at least one (1) Business Day prior to such effective date, cancel its request for the commitment increase. Upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to any increase in the Aggregate Commitment, the Global Administrative Agent shall promptly advise Harley and each Syndicated Global Lender of the effective date of such increase. Upon the effective date of any increase in the Aggregate Commitment that is supported by a Proposed New Lender, such Proposed New Lender shall be a party to this Agreement as a Lender and shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder.

        In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit hereunder, each Guarantor fully and unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, the Obligations (including, without limitation, interest accruing hereunder after the commencement of any case under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy-related rules or legislation in any country in which a Company is organized, whether or not allowed as a claim in such case). The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article XII are sometimes referred to as the "". Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its Guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any Obligation.
Guarantee
        Each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be affected by the failure of any Lender or the Global Administrative Agent to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or otherwise, or, except as specifically provided therein, by any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any other agreement.
        Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee hereunder constitutes a promise of payment when due and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other person.
        Each Guarantor agrees that its obligations under this Guarantee shall be unconditional, irrespective of:
        The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of the Obligations or otherwise. The Lenders, either themselves or acting through the Global Administrative Agent, are authorized, without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, from time to time, (a) to renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or other terms relating to, all or any part of the Obligations, or to otherwise modify, amend or change the terms of any of the Loan Documents; (b) to accept partial payments on all or any part of the Obligations; (c) to take and hold security or collateral for the payment of all or any part of the Obligations, this Guarantee, or any other guaranties of all or any part of the Obligations, (d) to exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security or collateral; (e) to apply such security or collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as in their discretion they may determine; (f) to settle, release, exchange, enforce, waive, compromise or collect or otherwise liquidate all or any part of the Obligations, this Guarantee, any other guaranty of all or any part of the Obligations, and any security or collateral for the Obligations or for any such guaranty.
        The Guarantors consent and agree that none of the Lenders nor the Global Administrative Agent nor any Person acting for or on behalf of the Lenders or the Global Administrative Agent shall be under any obligation to marshall any assets in favor of any Guarantor or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. The Guarantors further agree that, to the extent that any Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations makes a payment or payments to any Lender or the Global Administrative Agent, or any Lender or the Global Administrative Agent receives any proceeds of collateral for all or any part of the Obligations, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to any Borrower, such Guarantor, such other guarantor or any other Person, or their respective estates, trustees, receivers or any other party, under any bankruptcy law, state, provincial or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the part of the Obligations which has been paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the time immediately preceding such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction.
        In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Global Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in equity against the Guarantors by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrower to pay any of the Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Global Administrative Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, the amount of such unpaid Obligations. The Guarantors further agree, jointly and severally, that if payment in respect of any of the Obligations owed to any Lender shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than as designated in this Agreement or the Syndicated Canadian Addendum and if, by reason of any Change in Law (as defined in Section 3.1), disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligations in such currency or such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the judgment of such Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of such Lender, the Guarantors shall make payment of such Obligation in Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in the applicable place designated in this Agreement or the Syndicated Canadian Addendum, and shall indemnify such Lender against any losses or expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
        Until the Obligations have been paid in full in cash and the Termination Date shall have occurred, the Guarantors (i) shall have no right of subrogation with respect to such Obligations and (ii) waive any right to enforce any remedy which the Lenders or the Global Administrative Agent (or any of them) now have or may hereafter have against any Borrower, any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations or any other Person, and the Guarantors waive any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to the Lenders and the Global Administrative Agent (or any of them) to secure the payment or performance of all or any part of the Obligations or any other liability of any Borrower to the Lenders or the Global Administrative Agent (or any of them).
        This Guarantee shall continue in full force and effect and may not be terminated or otherwise revoked until the Obligations shall have been fully paid (in cash) and discharged and this Agreement and all financing arrangements between any Borrower, the Global Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have been terminated; if a Guarantor is merged or consolidated with another Company pursuant to or if the capital stock of a Guarantor is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (as in effect on the Closing Date), such Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement without further action. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guarantors (or any of them) shall have any right under applicable law to terminate or revoke this Guarantee, the Guarantors agree that such termination or revocation shall not be effective until a written notice of such revocation or termination, specifically referring hereto, signed by the Guarantors, is actually received by the Global Administrative Agent. Such notice shall not affect the right and power of any of the Lenders or the Global Administrative Agent to enforce rights arising prior to receipt thereof by the Global Administrative Agent. If any Lender grants loans or takes other action after a Guarantor terminates or revokes this Guarantee but before the Global Administrative Agent receives such written notice, the rights of such Lender with respect thereto shall be the same as if such termination or revocation had not occurred. The provisions of this Article XII shall remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, until the Obligations shall have been fully paid (in cash) and discharged.

If any fee shall be charged by the Lenders in connection with any such increase, such fee shall be in accordance with then prevailing market conditions, which market conditions shall have been reasonably documented by the Global Administrative Agent to Harley. No less than two (2) Business Days prior to the effective date of the increase of the Aggregate Commitment, the Global Administrative Agent shall notify Harley of the amount of the fee to be charged by the Lenders, and Harley may, at least one (1) Business Day prior to such effective date, cancel its request for the commitment increase. Upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to any increase in the Aggregate Commitment, the Global Administrative Agent shall promptly advise Harley and each Syndicated Global Lender of the effective date of such increase. Upon the effective date of any increase in the Aggregate Commitment that is supported by a Proposed New Lender, such Proposed New Lender shall be a party to this Agreement as a Lender and shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder.

        In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit hereunder, each Guarantor fully and unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, the Obligations (including, without limitation, interest accruing hereunder after the commencement of any case under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy-related rules or legislation in any country in which a Company is organized, whether or not allowed as a claim in such case). The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article XII are sometimes referred to as the "". Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its Guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any Obligation.
Guarantee
        Each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be affected by the failure of any Lender or the Global Administrative Agent to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or otherwise, or, except as specifically provided therein, by any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any other agreement.
        Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee hereunder constitutes a promise of payment when due and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other person.
        Each Guarantor agrees that its obligations under this Guarantee shall be unconditional, irrespective of:
        The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of the Obligations or otherwise. The Lenders, either themselves or acting through the Global Administrative Agent, are authorized, without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, from time to time, (a) to renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or other terms relating to, all or any part of the Obligations, or to otherwise modify, amend or change the terms of any of the Loan Documents; (b) to accept partial payments on all or any part of the Obligations; (c) to take and hold security or collateral for the payment of all or any part of the Obligations, this Guarantee, or any other guaranties of all or any part of the Obligations, (d) to exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security or collateral; (e) to apply such security or collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as in their discretion they may determine; (f) to settle, release, exchange, enforce, waive, compromise or collect or otherwise liquidate all or any part of the Obligations, this Guarantee, any other guaranty of all or any part of the Obligations, and any security or collateral for the Obligations or for any such guaranty.
        The Guarantors consent and agree that none of the Lenders nor the Global Administrative Agent nor any Person acting for or on behalf of the Lenders or the Global Administrative Agent shall be under any obligation to marshall any assets in favor of any Guarantor or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. The Guarantors further agree that, to the extent that any Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations makes a payment or payments to any Lender or the Global Administrative Agent, or any Lender or the Global Administrative Agent receives any proceeds of collateral for all or any part of the Obligations, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to any Borrower, such Guarantor, such other guarantor or any other Person, or their respective estates, trustees, receivers or any other party, under any bankruptcy law, state, provincial or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the part of the Obligations which has been paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the time immediately preceding such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction.
        In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Global Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in equity against the Guarantors by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrower to pay any of the Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Global Administrative Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, the amount of such unpaid Obligations. The Guarantors further agree, jointly and severally, that if payment in respect of any of the Obligations owed to any Lender shall be due at a place of payment other than as designated in this Agreement and if, by reason of any Change in Law (as defined in Section 3.1), war or civil disturbance or other event, such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the judgment of such Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of such Lender, the Guarantors shall make payment of such Obligation in the applicable place designated in this Agreement, and shall indemnify such Lender against any losses or expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
        Until the Obligations have been paid in full in cash and the Termination Date shall have occurred, the Guarantors (i) shall have no right of subrogation with respect to such Obligations and (ii) waive any right to enforce any remedy which the Lenders or the Global Administrative Agent (or any of them) now have or may hereafter have against any Borrower, any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations or any other Person, and the Guarantors waive any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to the Lenders and the Global Administrative Agent (or any of them) to secure the payment or performance of all or any part of the Obligations or any other liability of any Borrower to the Lenders or the Global Administrative Agent (or any of them).
        This Guarantee shall continue in full force and effect and may not be terminated or otherwise revoked until the Obligations shall have been fully paid (in cash) and discharged and this Agreement and all financing arrangements between any Borrower, the Global Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have been terminated; if a Guarantor is merged or consolidated with another Company pursuant to or if the capital stock of a Guarantor is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (as in effect on the Closing Date), such Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement without further action. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guarantors (or any of them) shall have any right under applicable law to terminate or revoke this Guarantee, the Guarantors agree that such termination or revocation shall not be effective until a written notice of such revocation or termination, specifically referring hereto, signed by the Guarantors, is actually received by the Global Administrative Agent. Such notice shall not affect the right and power of any of the Lenders or the Global Administrative Agent to enforce rights arising prior to receipt thereof by the Global Administrative Agent. If any Lender grants loans or takes other action after a Guarantor terminates or revokes this Guarantee but before the Global Administrative Agent receives such written notice, the rights of such Lender with respect thereto shall be the same as if such termination or revocation had not occurred. The provisions of this Article XII shall remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, until the Obligations shall have been fully paid (in cash) and discharged.
