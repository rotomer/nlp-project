Harley-Davidson, Inc. (the "Company") filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 10, 2008 (with a filing date of December 11, 2008). The registration statement enables the Company to sell, in one or more public offerings, its debt, common stock, preferred stock and other securities at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of the applicable offering. The shelf registration provides the Company with flexibility to publicly offer and sell securities at times it believes market conditions make such an offering attractive to the Company. Because the Company is a well-known seasoned issuer, the shelf registration statement is available for immediate use.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
