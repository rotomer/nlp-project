        Harley-Davidson, Inc. (the "") believes the entry by the Company or certain subsidiaries of the Company into the agreements and amendments described in Item 8.01 involves matters in the ordinary course of the Company's business. However, to the extent such matters constitute the Company's entry into a material definitive agreement or an amendment of a material definitive agreement, the text of Item 8.01 is incorporated by reference herein.
Company
        The Company believes the entry by the Company or certain subsidiaries of the Company into the agreements and amendments described in Item 8.01 and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such agreements and amendments involve indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of the Company's business. However, to the extent such matters have resulted in the Company becoming obligated on a direct financial obligation that is material to the Company, the text of Item 8.01 is incorporated by reference herein.
        On July 16, 2008, the Company, its subsidiary Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Inc. ("") and certain other subsidiaries entered into bank credit facilities totaling $1,900,000,000. The facilities were comprised of a $950,000,000, 364-day facility maturing in July 2009 (the "") and a $950,000,000, 3-year facility maturing in July 2011 (the "" and, together with the 2008 364-Day Credit Facility, the "").
HDFS
2008 364-Day Credit Facility
3-Year Credit Facility
2008 Credit Facilities
        On April 30, 2009, the Company, HDFS and certain other subsidiaries entered into a new 364-day credit facility (the "") to refinance and replace the 2008 364-Day Credit Facility. Under the New 364-Day Credit Facility, the lenders have committed to make available to the Company and each subsidiary of the Company that is a borrower thereunder a revolving credit facility in an amount of up to $625,000,000. There were no outstanding loans under the 2008 364-Day Credit Facility as of the closing under the New 364-Day Credit Facility. The New 364-Day Credit Facility provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2010 (subject to a one-year term loan option, as described below).
New 364-Day Credit Facility
        Also on April 30, 2009, the Company, HDFS and certain other subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the 3-Year Credit Facility (the "") so as to make certain changes conforming to the New 364-Day Credit Facility. The 3-Year Credit Facility, as so amended (the ""), continues to provide for up to $950,000,000 of revolving credit, and its maturity date remains July 2011.
3-Year Amendment
Amended 3-Year Credit Facility
        The Company, HDFS and other subsidiaries as borrowers or guarantors, various financial institutions as lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, are parties to the New 364-Day Credit Facility and the Amended 3-Year Credit Facility (the ""). The Company is a party to both of the 2009 Credit Facilities as borrower, and until the Company achieves certain credit ratings, the Company is also a party to both of the 2009 Credit Facilities as guarantor.
2009 Credit Facilities
        Borrowings under each 2009 Credit Facility will bear interest at various variable rates, which may be adjusted upward or downward depending on certain criteria, such as credit ratings. The 2009 Credit Facilities also require the Company to pay a fee based upon the average daily unused portion of the aggregate commitments under such 2009 Credit Facility.
        HDFS has historically used credit facilities primarily to support HDFS' unsecured commercial paper program and to fund HDFS' lending activities and other operations. Outstanding commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the 2009 Credit Facilities. As a result, the combined total of outstanding commercial paper of HDFS and borrowings of all borrowers under the 2009 Credit Facilities may not exceed $1,575,000,000.
        Each 2009 Credit Facility contains various restrictions and covenants, including requirements that the Company and its subsidiaries maintain certain financial ratios at prescribed levels (as described in the following sentence) and other standard negative covenants. Each 2009 Credit Facility requires (i) HDFS to, as of the end of any fiscal month, maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of $500,000,000, (ii) HDFS and its consolidated subsidiaries to, as of the end of any fiscal month, maintain a ratio of (A) consolidated indebtedness (excluding certain subordinated and intercompany indebtedness) to (B) the sum of consolidated shareholders' equity net of intangible assets, preferred stock and certain subordinated indebtedness no greater than 10.00 to 1.00, and (iii) the Company to maintain a ratio of (A) consolidated net income plus consolidated interest expense, taxes on or measured by income, depreciation expense and amortization expense (subject to certain other adjustments) to (B) consolidated interest expense, as of the end of any fiscal quarter for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, of at least 2.50 to 1.00. In addition, so long as the Company has not achieved at least two of an issuer rating by Moody's of A2 (with stable outlook) or better, an implied corporate credit rating by S&P of A (with stable outlook) or better and an issuer default rating by Fitch of A (with stable outlook) or better, each 2009 Credit Facility requires the Company to, as of the end of any fiscal quarter and at the time of each borrowing, maintain a ratio of (A) consolidated indebtedness (excluding HDFS and its subsidiaries and certain intercompany indebtedness) to (B) consolidated net income plus consolidated interest expense, taxes on or measured by income, depreciation expense and amortization expense (subject to certain other adjustments) no greater than 2.75 to 1.00.
        Each 2009 Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under either 2009 Credit Facility occurs and is continuing, then the interest rate on all obligations under such 2009 Credit Facility may be increased above the otherwise applicable rate and the lenders under such 2009 Credit Facility may terminate their commitments and declare any outstanding obligations under such 2009 Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.
        The New 364-Day Credit Facility permits the Company to elect, subject to certain conditions including the payment of a fee, to convert revolving loans outstanding under the New 364-Day Credit Facility as of the April 2010 maturity date to a term loan maturing on the one-year anniversary of such conversion.
        The description of the Amended 3-Year Credit Facility and the New 364-Day Credit Facility, respectively, set forth above is qualified by reference to the 3-Year Amendment and the 364-Day Credit Agreement filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
        On December 12, 2008, Harley-Davidson Warehouse Funding Corp. (the "") and Harley-Davidson Credit Corp. (the ""), each an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a loan and servicing agreement (the "") with a group of conduit lenders and committed lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as program agent. The Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the 2008 Loan Agreement on December 12, 2008 which described how the conduit lenders funded the $500,000,000 advance to the Borrower under the 2008 Loan Agreement by issuing commercial paper. The 2008 Loan Agreement provided that, unless earlier terminated or subsequently extended by the mutual agreement of the Borrower and the lenders, the 2008 Loan Agreement would expire on March 31, 2009, at which time the Borrower would be obligated to repay the outstanding advance in full.
Borrower
Servicer
2008 Loan Agreement
        On March 18, 2009, the parties to the 2008 Loan Agreement entered into an amendment to the 2008 Loan Agreement (the ""). The Conduit Amendment extended the term of the 2008 Loan Agreement to March 17, 2010. The Conduit Amendment also amended the interest rates that applied under the 2008 Loan Agreement to provide for a step-up in interest rates on certain dates over time.
Conduit Amendment
        On April 30, 2009, the parties to the 2008 Loan Agreement and certain other lenders entered into a new loan and servicing agreement to refinance and replace the 2008 Loan Agreement (the "Agreement"). The 2009 Loan Agreement, like the 2008 Loan Agreement, provides for the extension of credit by a group of conduit lenders and committed lenders to the Borrower, the pledge of a portfolio of receivables arising from retail sales of motorcycles (collectively, the "") by the Borrower as collateral and the servicing of the Receivables by the Servicer. The Borrower and the Servicer have amended and restated the existing receivables sale agreement between them entered into in connection with the 2008 Loan Agreement to permit the conveyance of receivables by the Servicer to the Borrower from time to time in return for cash and/or equity (as amended and restated, the ""). The conduit lenders under the 2009 Loan Agreement will fund their advances to the Borrower by issuing commercial paper. Unless earlier terminated or subsequently extended by the mutual agreement of the Borrower and the lenders, the 2009 Loan Agreement will expire on April 29, 2010, at which time the Borrower will be obligated to repay all outstanding principal in full. The term of the 2009 Loan Agreement may be extended by agreement of the parties for additional 364-day periods in the sole discretion of the lenders. The 2009 Loan Agreement does not result in an off-balance sheet arrangement for the Company and, therefore, will be treated as a financing on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
2009 Loan
Receivables
Receivables Sale Agreement
        Although the 2009 Loan Agreement is substantially similar to the 2008 Loan Agreement, the 2009 Loan Agreement differs from the 2008 Loan Agreement by, among other things, (i) providing for revolving borrowings, instead of a single advance, in amounts based upon, among other things, the amount of eligible Receivables pledged as collateral from time to time and financial ratios with respect to the performance of such Receivables, (ii) changing the advance rate and concentration limits applicable to the Receivables pledged as collateral and (iii) permitting the release of collections on the Receivables (in excess of interest, fees and certain other amounts) to the Borrower on a monthly basis instead of applying all such excess collections to the repayment of outstanding principal. While the amount that the Borrower may borrow is based upon, among other things, the amount of eligible Receivables pledged as collateral, borrowings are subject to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding from time to time of $1,200,000,000.
        The 2009 Loan Agreement provides for interest on outstanding principal based on prevailing commercial paper rates or, to the extent the advance is not funded by a conduit lender through the issuance of commercial paper, LIBOR, in each case plus a specified margin. The 2009 Loan Agreement also provides for an unused commitment fee based on the excess of the aggregate commitments of the committed lenders under the 2009 Loan Agreement over outstanding principal. As noted above, the Servicer acts as servicer of the Receivables pursuant to the 2009 Loan Agreement and receives a fee for such services.
        The Borrower borrowed $640.2 million under the 2009 Loan Agreement (including loans the proceeds of which the Borrower applied to the repayment of outstanding amounts under the 2008 Loan Agreement) as of April 30, 2009 on the basis of a pledge of Receivables in the aggregate amount of $883.0 million. The amount that the Borrower intends to borrow under the 2009 Loan Agreement will vary based upon HDFS' ability to continue to access the unsecured commercial paper markets, HDFS' ability to access the term securitization markets and the amount of eligible Receivables that the Borrower can pledge as collateral.
        The 2009 Loan Agreement contains customary events of default (with grace periods where customary), including, among other things, failure to pay interest or principal when due, change in control of the Company and insolvency events.
        The lenders under the 2009 Loan Agreement have no recourse to the Company or any of its affiliates (other than the Borrower) for repayment of the advances under the 2009 Loan Agreement. In addition, neither the Company nor the Servicer, nor any of their affiliates, have guaranteed the collectability of the Receivables or the creditworthiness of the obligors under the Receivables.
        The description of the 2009 Loan Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreement, respectively, set forth above is qualified by reference to the 2009 Loan Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreement filed herewith as Exhibits 4.3 and 4.4, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

At no time will a Conduit Lender be obligated to make all or any portion of any Loan to be made by its Lender Group hereunder. (c) Committed Lender's Commitment. (i) If a Conduit Lender elects not to make all or any portion of the Loan to be made by its Lender Group, the same shall be made by the Committed Lenders in its Lender Group on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Commitments.

SECTION 2.02. Making the Advance.

On each Borrowing Date, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article III, and so long as such Advance does not otherwise violate the terms and conditions hereof, each Conduit Lender or each Committed Lender, as applicable, shall remit to the account specified by the Administrative Agent in its Lender Group by wire transfer in same day funds at such time as shall enable such Administrative Agent to remit such funds to the Borrower by 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Borrowing Date, an amount equal to (1) in the case of a Conduit Lender, its Lender Group's Pro Rata Share of the Advance, and (2) in the case of a Committed Lender, its individual Pro Rata Share thereof.

Upon the making of such wire transfers and deposits, each Lender Group shall be deemed to have extended its Loan to the Borrower as part of such Advance. 33

(b) Borrowing Notice Irrevocable. Each Borrowing Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. The Borrower shall reimburse each Lender for any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or prior to the Borrowing Date specified in such Borrowing Notice the applicable conditions set forth in Article III or any other term or condition described in this Agreement, including any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of funds acquired by such Lender to fund its Loan when the Loan, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

The Borrower may request, no more frequently than once each year, by delivering written notice to the Administrative Agents and the Program Agent, that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional 364 days, with such extension to become effective as of and from the date all of the Lenders consenting thereto shall in their sole discretion consent to such extension. The Administrative Agents will forward such requests to the Lenders in their respective Lender Groups. Any such request shall be subject to the following conditions: (w) at no time shall any Commitment have a term of more than 364 days and, if any such request would result in a term of more than 364 days, such request shall be deemed to have been made for such number of days so that, after giving effect to such extension on the date requested, such term will not exceed 364 days, (x) none of the Lenders will have any obligation to extend any Commitment, (y) if fewer than all of the Lenders agree to extend the Maturity Date at such time, then any such extension of the Maturity Date will be effective only if (1) those Lenders who initially agreed to extend the Maturity Date for an additional 364 days subsequently reaffirm their agreement to extend, acknowledging that it would then be without the participation of the non-extending Lenders, and (2) the Borrower shall have made payment in full of the principal balance of the Loans together with all other Borrower Obligations accrued hereunder and owing to each of the non-extending Lenders and their related Lender Groups on the Maturity Date in effect prior to such extension, and (z) any request for such extension shall be made not more than sixty (60) days prior to the then effective Maturity Date. Each Administrative Agent shall respond to such request in writing, on behalf of the Lenders in its Lender Group (with a copy to the Program Agent), within thirty (30) days after receipt of such request; provided that if such request was received less than thirty (30) days prior to the then effective Maturity Date, each Administrative Agent shall be given at least ten (10) days to respond thereto (meaning that no such request may be delivered fewer than ten (10) days before the Maturity Date). Any Administrative Agent's failure for any reason to respond to such a request within the applicable time period shall be deemed a rejection of the requested extension by the Lenders in its Lender Group. In the case of any Lender that shall not have agreed to (or been deemed to have rejected) an extension request, the Principal Balance of all Loans made by such Lender, together with all Borrower Obligations accrued hereunder and owing to such Lender shall be due and payable in full to such Lender on the Maturity Date that shall have been in effect at the time the request by the Borrower for an extension was made. 34
SECTION 2.03. Reduction in the Aggregate Commitment. The Borrower may, on any Settlement Date prior to the Maturity Date on not less than ten (10) days' prior irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agents, (i) prepay in whole all of the outstanding Borrower Obligations, together with any additional amount as may be necessary to pay all amounts, including any termination payments, due to the Hedge Counterparties on such Settlement Date as a result of such prepayment, or (ii) permanently reduce in part (ratably among the Committed Lenders) that portion of the Aggregate Commitment that exceeds the Aggregate Principal Balance (the "Unused Commitment"); provided, that upon each such reduction, the Borrower shall pay on the applicable Reduction Date a Make-Whole Fee to the Administrative Agents ratably based on the Pro Rata Share of each Lender Group's Lender Group Limit at such time; provided further, that if on any Reduction Date a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Lender shall not be entitled to a Make-Whole Fee in connection with the reduction being given effect on such Reduction Date. Any such reduction in the Aggregate Commitment shall be applied ratably to the Lenders and shall result in reductions of each of the Commitments, the Conduit Lending Limits and the Lender Group Limits based on their respective Pro Rata Shares of the applicable reduction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may elect to reduce the Unused Commitment of any Defaulting Lender prior to reducing the Aggregate Commitment ratably among the non-defaulting Committed Lenders. SECTION 2.04. Tranches. (a) Generally. Each Loan shall be allocated to one or more Tranche Periods. Any portion of a Loan having one Tranche Period and one Rate Type and held by one Lender is referred to herein as a "Tranche". From time to time the Borrower shall select Tranche Periods and Rate Types with respect to Tranches funded by the Committed Lenders, subject to the provisions of this Agreement and provided that no Event of Termination has occurred. At all times after the occurrence of and during the continuation of an Event of Termination, each Committed Lender shall select the Tranche Periods and Rate Types with respect to the Tranches it funds hereunder. Either the Borrower or, following an Event of Termination, the applicable Lender, may, upon notice to the other party received at least three (3) Business Days prior to the last day of any Tranche Period in the case of the Borrower giving notice, or up to the last day of such Tranche Period in the case of the Lender giving notice, either (i) divide any Tranche originating on such last day or having a Tranche Period ending on such last day into two or more Tranches having an aggregate Principal Balance equal to the Principal Balance of such undivided Tranche, or (ii) combine any two or more Tranches originating on such last day or having Tranche Periods ending on such last day into a single Tranche having a Principal Balance equal to the aggregate of the Principal Balance of such Tranches; provided, however, that no Tranche with respect to which Interest is determined by reference to the CP Rate may be combined with a Tranche with respect to which Interest is determined by reference to the Alternative Rate, and a Tranche held by one Lender may not be combined with any Tranche held by any other Lender. 35
(b) Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the adoption of or any change in any Law or in the interpretation or application thereof by any relevant Governmental Authority shall make it unlawful for any Lender, in its reasonable determination, to fund or maintain LIBOR Tranches as contemplated by this Agreement or to obtain in the interbank Eurodollar market the funds with which to make or maintain any such LIBOR Tranche, such Lender shall promptly notify the Program Agent, its Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof whereupon, until such Lender notifies the Borrower and the Program Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist (which notice such Lender shall promptly give), (i) the obligation of such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Tranches shall forthwith be suspended and (ii) such Lender's then outstanding LIBOR Tranches, if any, shall be converted on the last day of the Tranche Period for such Tranches or within such earlier period as required by Law into Base Rate Tranches. Before giving any notice to the Program Agent, its Administrative Agent and the Borrower pursuant to this clause (b), such Lender shall designate a different office as its lending office if such designation would avoid the need for giving such notice and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. (c) LIBO Rate Inadequate; Inability to Determine LIBO Rate. If prior to the commencement of any Tranche Period for a LIBOR Tranche, either (i) the related Lender reasonably determines that the rate at which deposits of Dollars are being offered to such Lender in the London interbank market does not accurately reflect the cost to such Lender of funding or maintaining LIBOR Tranches for such Tranche Period or (ii) the related Lender is unable, after reasonable attempts, to obtain Dollars in the London interbank market to fund or maintain such Tranche for such Tranche Period, then such Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrower, its Administrative Agent and the Program Agent by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until such Lender notifies the Borrower, its Administrative Agent and the Program Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist (which notice such Lender shall promptly give), (A) the obligations of such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Tranches shall be suspended, and (B) each outstanding LIBOR Tranche funded by such Lender shall be converted into a Base Rate Tranche on the last day of the Tranche Period applicable thereto. SECTION 2.05. Interest and Fees; Hedging. (a) The Borrower shall pay Interest on the Principal Balance of each Tranche, which interest shall accrue for each day that such Principal Balance shall be outstanding. (b) On each Settlement Date, the Borrower shall pay to each Lender (or its related Administrative Agent) all accrued and unpaid Interest with respect to all Tranches funded by such Lender during the related Monthly Period (or, in the case of a Provisional Settlement Date, all accrued and unpaid Interest to such Settlement Date); provided that, in the case of any LIBOR Tranche, the Borrower shall, if so requested by the applicable Lender, pay to such Lender all accrued and unpaid Interest thereon on the last day of the related Tranche Period. (c) On each Settlement Date, the Borrower shall pay to each Administrative Agent an amount equal to the sum of the Usage Fee and the Unused Fee, if any, accrued in respect of each day during the related Monthly Period (or, in the case of a Provisional Settlement Date, all accrued and unpaid Usage Fees and Unused Fees to such Settlement Date) for the benefit of each Lender in such Administrative Agent's Lender Group, which fees shall accrue on each day during the period from the Effective Date to the date the Loans shall be repaid in full as specified herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Usage Fee shall not accrue on any day that the Default Rate shall then be in effect as the Interest Rate. 36
(d) On or before the fifth Business Day prior to each Settlement Date (or, in the case of a Provisional Settlement Date, such notice as may be reasonably practicable under the circumstances), each Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders in its Lender Group, shall furnish the Borrower with an invoice setting forth (i) the amount of the accrued and unpaid Interest and the calculation thereof for all Tranches funded by the Lenders in its Lender Group during the related Monthly Period (or other applicable period), and (ii) the amount of the accrued and unpaid Usage Fee payable to the Lenders in such Administrative Agent's Lender Group during such period. (e) From and after the initial Borrowing Date, at all times that any Loan shall be outstanding, the Borrower shall cause Eligible Hedging Agreements to be in place and to be maintained with Eligible Hedge Counterparties in respect of the Aggregate Principal Balance then outstanding. The Borrower shall confer with each Administrative Agent as to the Hedge Agreements that shall correspond to the Loans made such Administrative Agent's Lender Group. Each Hedge Agreement proposed to be effective on the initial Borrowing Date in respect of the Loans being made on such date shall, if in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Syndication Agents, constitute an Eligible Hedge Agreement. Each new Hedge Agreement, and each amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified Hedge Agreement, that is proposed to be effective at any time after the initial Borrowing Date shall constitute an Eligible Hedge Agreement if it is either (i) in form and substance substantially similar to the corresponding Hedge Agreement that shall have been in effect on the initial Borrowing Date or (ii) otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Syndication Agents, with approval by the Syndication Agents not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Borrower shall cause the Hedge Agreements in respect of all Loans made on the same Borrowing Date to be uniform in terms of cap rate, amortization schedule, and such other terms as otherwise necessary to cause each such Hedge Agreement to be in substantially the same form such that no one Hedge Agreement contains material provisions which are more favorable than the provisions included in the other Hedge Agreements. SECTION 2.06. Maturity Date. The Aggregate Principal Balance of the Loans together with other Borrower Obligations accrued hereunder shall be due and payable in full, together with all Interest thereon accrued to such date, on the Maturity Date unless (i) earlier repaid pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.08), or (ii) the Borrower Obligations are required to be repaid on any earlier date in accordance Section 7.02. 37
SECTION 2.07. Evidence of Debt. The Loans may be evidenced by two series of promissory notes (each, a "Note") executed and delivered by the Borrower to each Lender in the principal amount of the Loan or portion thereof made by such Lender. If such a series is requested by any of the Lender Groups, one series of Notes will be explicitly rated by at least one Rating Agency as having a long-term debt rating equivalent to AAA/Aaa and each such Note shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto (a "Rated Note"). The other series of Notes will not require an explicit rating from the Rating Agencies and each such Note shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto (an "Unrated Note"). In all respects other than the classification of the Notes as rated or unrated, the Notes will be entitled to identical rights and priority. The Notes will be ranked pari passu and the Lenders holding such Notes will share equally in the Collateral and will be entitled to the same rights and remedies under this Agreement and the other Facility Documents. Each Lender Group may elect, in its sole discretion, to have either a Rated Note or an Unrated Note issued by the Borrower to its Lender Group. In the case of any Lender that does not request a Note, such Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from the Loan or portion thereof made by such Lender, including the outstanding principal balance of such Loan and the amount of Interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The entries made in such accounts of the Lenders shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay any Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 2.08. Settlement Procedures. (a) Deposits to Collection Account. The Servicer shall instruct the Lockbox Bank to remit all Collections identified with the Contracts from the Lockbox Account directly to the Collection Account within two (2) Business Days of identification. In the event that the Borrower and/or the Servicer receives any Collections or other proceeds of the Collateral, each shall remit the same directly to the Collection Account within two (2) Business Days of receipt. On each Settlement Date, each of the Borrower and the Servicer shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited to the Collection Account all amounts described in "Total Distribution Amount" together with any other Collections received by either of them that have not previously been deposited to the Collection Account. The Servicer shall not make any withdrawals from the Collection Account or the Reserve Account, as applicable, at any time except for the purpose of distributing such Collections and other amounts in accordance with Sections 2.08(b) and 2.08(c), as applicable; provided, that the Servicer may, from time to time, withdraw amounts from the Collection Account as contemplated in Section 6.06, and the Servicer may cause amounts in the Collection Account and the Reserve Account, as applicable, to be invested in Permitted Investments maturing not later than the Settlement Date next following such investment. (b) Application of Collections - Revolving Period. On each Settlement Date, the Servicer shall apply the Total Distribution Amount for such Settlement Date in the following order of priority: (i) first, to the Servicer for the repayment of any outstanding Servicer Advance made in respect of any Contract; (ii) second, to the Servicer the accrued and unpaid Servicer Fee, including any unpaid Servicer Fees with respect to any prior Monthly Periods; (iii) third, to be distributed pari passu to the Administrative Agents, the Program Agent and the Hedge Counterparties, as applicable: (A) to each Administrative Agent for the Lenders in its respective Lender Group, on a pro rata basis, and if applicable to the Program Agent, an amount equal to the aggregate accrued and unpaid Priority Finance Charges, and (B) to the Hedge Counterparties, on a pro rata basis, all net monthly payments, if any, due to the Hedge Counterparties on such Settlement Date (other than such payments due upon the termination of any Hedge Agreement); 38
(iv) fourth, to be distributed pari passu to the Administrative Agents and the Hedge Counterparties, as applicable: (A) to the Administrative Agents for the Lenders in their respective Lender Groups, an amount equal to each Lender Group's Pro Rata Share of the Target Principal Amount, and (B) to the Hedge Counterparties, on a pro rata basis, any payments due upon the termination of any Hedge Agreement to which they are party (other than Subordinated Swap Termination Payments); (v) fifth, to be distributed to the Administrative Agents for the Lenders in their respective Lender Group, on a pro rata basis, an amount equal to the aggregate accrued and unpaid Subordinated Finance Charges (to the extent the same constitute Interest or Fees), if any; (vi) sixth, to be deposited to the Reserve Account, the amount of any Reserve Account Shortfall; (vii) seventh, to be distributed to the Program Agent, an amount equal to the aggregate accrued and unpaid Subordinated Finance Charges due and payable to the Program Agent (to the extent constituting reimbursement for enforcement costs and expenses); (viii) eighth, to be distributed to any applicable Hedge Counterparties, on a pro rata basis, any Subordinated Swap Termination Payments then due and payable; (ix) ninth, if any Borrower Obligations (including "Unpaid Amounts" (as defined in the Hedge Agreements)) (other than the amounts paid pursuant to clauses (i) through (vii) above) are then due and payable by the Borrower to any Secured Party, to each such Secured Party (ratably in accordance with the amounts owing to each) the Borrower Obligations so due and payable; (x) tenth, to be distributed pari passu, all unpaid amounts then payable to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association under the Control Agreement and to the Program Agent under the Reserve Account Agreement; and (xi) eleventh, any remaining funds to the Borrower. In addition to the foregoing, the Servicer shall, to the extent of funds then available in the Collection Account, on the last day of any Tranche Period for a LIBOR Tranche, disburse to the applicable Administrative Agent for the Committed Lender that shall have funded or maintained such LIBOR Tranche, an amount equal to the Interest on such LIBOR Tranche. (c) Application of Collections - Post-Revolving Period. Upon the occurrence of and during the continuation of an Event of Termination and at all times following the end of the Revolving Period, the Servicer shall apply the Total Distribution Amount on each Settlement Date in the following order of priority: 39
(i) first, to the Servicer for the repayment of any outstanding Servicer Advance made in respect of any Contract; (ii) second, to the Servicer, if the Servicer is not HDCC or an Affiliate of HDCC, the accrued and unpaid Servicer Fee, including any unpaid Servicer Fees with respect to any prior Monthly Periods; (iii) third, to be distributed pari passu to the Administrative Agents, the Program Agent and the Hedge Counterparties, as applicable: (A) to each Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in its respective Lender Group, on a pro rata basis, and if applicable to the Program Agent, an amount equal to the aggregate accrued and unpaid Priority Finance Charges, and (B) to the Hedge Counterparties, on a pro rata basis, all net monthly payments, if any, due to the Hedge Counterparties on such Settlement Date (other than such payments due upon the termination of any Hedge Agreement); (iv) fourth, to be distributed pari passu to the Administrative Agents and the Hedge Counterparties, as applicable: (A) to the Administrative Agents for the Lenders in their respective Lender Groups, an amount equal to each Lender Group's Pro Rata Share of the Target Principal Amount, and (B) to the Hedge Counterparties, on a pro rata basis, any payments due upon the termination of any Hedge Agreement to which they are party (other than Subordinated Swap Termination Payments); (v) fifth, to be distributed to the Administrative Agents for the Lenders in their respective Lender Group, on a pro rata basis, and if applicable to the Program Agent, an amount equal to the aggregate accrued and unpaid Subordinated Finance Charges, if any; (vi) sixth, to be distributed to any applicable Hedge Counterparties, on a pro rata basis, any Subordinated Swap Termination Payments then due and payable; (vii) seventh, if any Borrower Obligations (including "Unpaid Amounts" (as defined in the Hedge Agreements)) (other than the amounts paid pursuant to clauses (i) through (vi) above) are then due and payable by the Borrower to any Secured Party, to each such Secured Party (ratably in accordance with the amounts owing to each) the Borrower Obligations so due and payable; (viii) eighth, to be distributed pari passu, all unpaid amounts then payable to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association under the Control Agreement and to the Program Agent under the Reserve Account Agreement; (ix) ninth, if the Servicer is HDCC or an Affiliate thereof, to the Servicer the amounts specified in clause (ii) above; and 40
(x) tenth, on the Final Collection Date, any remaining funds to the Borrower. Any payment to be made to the Lenders hereunder shall be made to the applicable Administrative Agent on behalf of its related Lenders as described in clauses (b) and (c) above and such payment shall conclusively satisfy the Borrower's or the Servicer's payment duties hereunder. (d) Reserve Account. (i) On each Settlement Date, if the Total Distribution Amount is estimated to be less than the aggregate amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.08(b)(i) through (iii), then the Servicer shall withdraw from the Reserve Account and remit to the Collection Account on the Business Day preceding the Settlement Date the amount of such deficiency and shall apply such amount in accordance with Section 2.08(b). (ii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Termination and at all times following the end of the Revolving Period, if at any time the Total Distribution Amount is less than the aggregate amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.08(c)(i) through (vi), the Servicer shall withdraw from the Reserve Account the amount of such deficiency and shall apply such amount in accordance with Section 2.08(c). (iii) On each Settlement Date during the Revolving Period, if (A) the Total Distribution Amount is sufficient in amount to pay all amounts then due under Section 2.08(b)(i) through (x), and (B) no Event of Termination or Incipient Event of Termination shall have occurred and then be continuing, the Servicer may distribute to the Borrower the excess of the aggregate amount then held in the Reserve Account over the Minimum Reserve Amount. (iv) Upon the Aggregate Principal Balance being reduced to zero and all other Borrower Obligations being indefeasibly paid in full, after giving effect to any withdrawals on such date pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above, all amounts then remaining in the Reserve Account shall be released to the Borrower. (e) The Borrower hereby represents and warrants that each remittance of Collections to the Program Agent or the Administrative Agents, as applicable, hereunder will have been (i) in payment of a debt incurred by the Borrower in the ordinary course of its business or financial affairs and (ii) made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the Borrower. SECTION 2.09. Removal of Defaulted Contracts. In the event the Borrower shall be capable of selling, assigning or otherwise transferring a Contract that has become a Defaulted Contract for an amount not less than the Repurchase Price (or such other price as shall be acceptable to the Syndication Agents in their sole discretion), the Borrower may, with the consent of the Syndication Agents, remove from the Collateral such Defaulted Contract and the related Contract Assets by depositing to the Collection Account on the Settlement Date immediately following the Monthly Period in which such Contract became a Defaulted Contract an amount equal to the Repurchase Price (or such other price) from the proceeds of such sale, assignment or other transfer. 41
SECTION 2.10. Payments and Computations, Etc. (a) All amounts to be paid or deposited by the Borrower or the Servicer hereunder shall be paid or deposited in accordance with the terms hereof no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when due in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available funds to an account the Program Agent or the relevant Administrative Agents may designate prior to such payment from time to time in writing. The Borrower and the Servicer shall, to the extent permitted by law, pay to the Affected Party interest on all amounts not paid or deposited or debited by such Person when due hereunder at the Default Rate, payable on demand. All computations of interest and all computations of Interest and Fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) elapsed; provided that all computations of Interest on Base Rate Tranches shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) elapsed. In no event shall any provision of this Agreement require the payment or permit the collection of Interest in excess of the maximum permitted by applicable law. In the event that any payment hereunder (whether constituting a repayment of Loans or a payment of Interest or any other amount) is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason, the amount of such payment shall be restored and such payment shall be considered not to have been made. SECTION 2.11. Interest Protection. (a) If due to either: (i) the introduction of or any change (including, without limitation, any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements) in or in the interpretation by any Governmental Authority of any law or regulation (other than laws or regulations relating to taxes) after the date hereof, (ii) the compliance by any Affected Party with any directive or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) imposed after the date hereof, or (iii) any change in any accounting guideline by an accounting board or authority (whether or not part of a government or instrumentality thereof) which is responsible for the establishment of or interpretation of national or international accounting principles (in each case whether foreign or domestic); (1) there shall be an increase in the cost to such Affected Party of funding or maintaining any Tranche which accrues Interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the CP Rate hereunder or of extending a commitment in respect thereof, or (2) such Affected Party shall be required to make a payment calculated by reference to any Tranche which accrues Interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the CP Rate funded by it or Interest received by it, then the Borrower shall, on the next Settlement Date which is at least five (5) Business Days after receipt of the certificate described in Section 2.11(b), pay such Administrative Agent for the account of such Affected Party (as a third party beneficiary, in the case of any Affected Party other than one of the Lenders), that portion of such increased costs incurred, amounts not received or required payment made or to be made, which such Administrative Agent reasonably determines is attributable to funding and maintaining, or extending a commitment to fund, any Tranche which accrues Interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the CP Rate hereunder or pursuant to any Asset Purchase Agreement or similar liquidity facility. 42
(b) Each Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Program Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle any Affected Party in its Lender Group to compensation pursuant to Section 2.11(a). Each Affected Party will designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Affected Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. In determining the amount of such compensation, such Affected Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. The applicable Affected Party (or such party's related Administrative Agent) shall submit to the Borrower a certificate describing in reasonable detail such increased costs incurred, amounts not received or receivable or required payment made or to be made (including the calculation thereof), which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. SECTION 2.12. Accounting Based Consolidation Event. (a) If an Accounting Based Consolidation Event shall at any time occur, the Borrower shall, on the next Settlement Date which is at least five (5) Business Days after receipt of the certificate described below, pay the applicable Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant Affected Party, such amounts as such Affected Party reasonably determines will compensate or reimburse such Affected Party for any resulting (i) fee, expense or increased cost, including without limitation, charged to, incurred or otherwise suffered by such Affected Party, or (ii) reduction in the rate of return on such Affected Party's capital or reduction in the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Affected Party, in each case determined by such Affected Party to be allocable to the Borrower or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement in connection therewith. Amounts under this Section 2.12 may be demanded at any time without regard to the timing of issuance of any financial statement by any Conduit Lender or by any Affected Party; provided that a Conduit Lender on behalf of such Affected Party shall provide to the Borrower a calculation in reasonable detail of the amounts payable to each Affected Party pursuant to this Section 2.12 and such calculation shall be binding in the absence of manifest error; provided, further, in respect of any Monthly Period, the amount due to an Affected Party under this Section 2.12 when combined with the Interest payable to such Affected Party for such Monthly Period shall be equal to the amount of Interest that would have accrued if the Tranche held by such Affected Party were a Base Rate Tranche during such Monthly Period. (b) For purposes of this Section 2.12, "Accounting Based Consolidation Event" means the consolidation, for financial and/or regulatory accounting purposes, of all or any portion of the assets and liabilities of any Conduit Lender that are subject to this Agreement or any other Facility Document with all or any portion of the assets and liabilities of an Affected Party. An Accounting Based Consolidation Event shall be deemed to occur on the date any Affected Party shall acknowledge in writing that any such consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a Conduit Lender shall occur. SECTION 2.13. Increased Capital. 43
(a) If, after the date hereof, (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation by any Official Body of any law or regulation, (ii) compliance by any Affected Party with any new or changed directive or request from any central bank or other Official Body (whether or not having the force of law), or (iii) any change in any accounting guideline by an accounting board or authority (whether or not part of a government or instrumentality thereof) which is responsible for the establishment of or interpretation of national or international accounting principles (in each case whether foreign or domestic), affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Affected Party or such Affected Party reasonably determines that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of any Lender's agreement to make or maintain Loans hereunder and other similar agreements or facilities and such event would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Affected Party by an amount deemed by such Affected Party to be material, then, on the next Settlement Date which occurs at least five (5) days after receipt of the certificate described in Section 2.13(b), the Borrower shall pay to such Affected Party (as a third party beneficiary, in the case of any Affected Party other than one of the Lenders) or the related Administrative Agent for the account of such Affected Party from time to time, as specified by such Affected Party or such Administrative Agent, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Affected Party in light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Affected Party or such Administrative Agent on behalf of such Affected Party reasonably determines such increase in capital to be attributable to the existence of the applicable Lender's agreements hereunder. (b) Each Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Program Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle any Lender or Affected Party in its Lender Group to compensation pursuant to Section 2.13(a). Each Lender or Affected Party will designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender or Affected Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. In determining the amount of such compensation, such Lender or Affected Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. The applicable Lender or Affected Party (or such party's related Administrative Agent) shall submit to the Borrower a certificate describing in reasonable detail such compensation (including the calculations thereof), which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. SECTION 2.14. Funding Losses. In the event that any Liquidity Provider or any Lender shall incur any loss, expense or Liquidation Fees (including, without limitation, any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Liquidity Provider or Lender in order to fund or maintain any Loan or interest therein) as a result of any reduction of the Principal Balance of any Tranche at any time or conversion of any Tranche to another Tranche prior to the originally scheduled last day of the applicable Tranche Period, then, on the Settlement Date following written demand from the related Administrative Agent to the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to such Administrative Agent for the account of such Liquidity Provider or Lender, the amount of such loss, expense or Liquidation Fees. Such written demand shall describe in reasonable detail the components of such funding loss and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower. 44
SECTION 2.15. Taxes. Except to the extent required by applicable law, any and all payments and deposits required to be made hereunder or under any instrument delivered hereunder by the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto (except for net income taxes that are imposed by the United States and franchise taxes, gross receipts taxes imposed in lieu of income taxes, and net income taxes that are imposed on such Affected Party by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such Affected Party is organized or any political subdivision thereof, collectively, "Excluded Taxes"). If the Borrower or the Servicer shall be required by law to make any such deduction, (i) the Borrower shall, except in the case of any deduction on account of Excluded Taxes, make an additional payment to such Affected Party, in an amount sufficient so that, after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15), such Affected Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower (or the Servicer, on its behalf) shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower (or the Servicer, on its behalf) shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. (a) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or other documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any instrument delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any instrument delivered hereunder. (b) Each Affected Party which is not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof shall, on or prior to the date that such Affected Party becomes a party to or obtains rights under this Agreement, and prior to any payment being made by the Borrower to such Affected Party, deliver to the Borrower (i) two duly completed and executed copies of the IRS Form W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI (or any successor form) as applicable; and (ii) such other forms or certificates as may be required under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction (on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete), in order to permit the Borrower to make payments to, and deposit funds to or for the account of, such Affected Party hereunder and under the other Facility Documents without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any tax. Each such Affected Party shall submit to the Borrower (with copies to the Program Agent) two updated, completed, and duly executed versions of: (i) all forms referred to in the previous sentence upon the expiry of, or the occurrence of any event requiring a change in, the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower or the substitution of such form; and (ii) such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower. (c) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the benefit of any Affected Party pursuant to this Section 2.15 as a result of a change of law or treaty occurring after such Affected Party first became a party to this Agreement, such Affected Party will, at the Borrower's request, change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if, in the reasonable judgment of such Affected Party, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Affected Party. SECTION 2.16. Security Interest. (a) As security for the performance by the Borrower of all the terms, covenants and agreements on the part of the Borrower to be performed under this Agreement or any other Facility Document, including the payment when due of all Borrower Obligations, the Borrower hereby grants to the Program Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a security interest in all of the Borrower's right, title and interest in and to all of its assets and interests in property, whether now existing or hereafter arising or acquired, including, without limitation, the following: 45
(i) all Contracts, together with all Related Security and Collections with respect thereto; (ii) the Collection Account, including, without limitation, (A) all Collections held therein and all certificates and instruments, if any, from time to time representing or evidencing the Collection Account or any Collections held therein, (B) all investment property and other financial assets representing Collections or proceeds thereof on deposit in, credited to, held in, or acquired with funds from, the Collection Account and all certificates and instruments from time to time representing or evidencing such investment property and financial assets, (C) all notes, certificates of deposit and other instruments from time to time hereafter delivered or transferred to, or otherwise possessed by, the Program Agent in substitution for the then existing investments in the Collection Account and (D) all interest, dividends, cash, instruments, financial assets, investment property and other property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for the Collection Account, in each case, related to Contracts; (iii) the Reserve Account, including, without limitation, (A) all amounts held therein and all certificates and instruments, if any, from time to time representing or evidencing the Reserve Account or any amounts held therein, (B) all investment property and other financial assets representing amounts or proceeds thereof on deposit in, credited to, held in, or acquired with funds from, the Reserve Account and all certificates and instruments from time to time representing or evidencing such investment property and financial assets, (C) all notes, certificates of deposit and other instruments from time to time hereafter delivered or transferred to, or otherwise possessed by, the Program Agent in substitution for the then existing investments in the Reserve Account and (D) all interest, dividends, cash, instruments, financial assets, investment property and other property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for the Reserve Account; (iv) all rights and remedies of the Borrower under the Receivables Sale Agreement, together with all financing statements filed by the Borrower against HDCC in connection therewith; (v) to the extent not included in the foregoing, the Contract Assets conveyed to the Borrower under the Receivables Sale Agreement; (vi) all rights and remedies of the Borrower under each Hedge Agreement; (vii) all accounts, chattel paper, inventory, equipment, instruments, investment property, deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, general intangibles and supporting obligations (all terms in this clause (vii) having the meaning assigned to them in Article 9 of the UCC of the applicable jurisdiction) constituting or relating to the foregoing; and 46
(viii) to the extent not included in the foregoing, all proceeds of any and all of the foregoing (the assets and interests in property described above in this Section 2.16(a), collectively, the "Collateral"). The Borrower hereby authorizes the filing of financing statements, and continuation statements and amendments thereto and assignments thereof, describing the collateral covered thereby as "all of debtor's personal property or assets" or words to that effect. This Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law. (b) (i) With respect to any Contract that has been repurchased by HDCC in accordance with Section 6.01 of the Receivables Sale Agreement, the Program Agent's security interest in such Contract and the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto shall be automatically released upon the deposit to the Collection Account of proceeds of such repurchase in an amount not less than the Repurchase Price. (ii) Upon prepayment in full of all of the Borrower Obligations in accordance with Section 2.03 or upon removal from the Collateral of any Defaulted Contract in accordance with Section 2.09 (including payment of the amount specified in Section 2.09), the Program Agent's security interest, on behalf of the Secured Parties, in all the Contracts (in the case of Section 2.03) or the removed Contract (in the case of Section 2.09), and the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto shall be automatically released on the date of prepayment or payment of removal proceeds, as applicable. (iii) On acknowledgement by the Program Agent of the occurrence of the Final Collection Date, the Program Agent's security interest in the Collateral shall automatically terminate. (iv) Upon the release or termination of the Program Agent's security interest in all or any portion of the Collateral as provided in this Section 2.16(b) or in Section 2.17, the Program Agent will, at the request and expense of the Borrower, (x) execute and deliver to the Borrower such instruments of release with respect to such Collateral, in recordable form if necessary, in favor of the Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request, (y) deliver any such Collateral in its possession to the Borrower or its designee, and (z) take such other actions as the Borrower may reasonably request (all without recourse to, and without representation or warranty by, the Program Agent, any Administrative Agent or any Lender, other than a representation to the effect that no Adverse Claim in the Collateral has been created by or through such Person) to evidence the release or termination of the Program Agent's security interest in the Collateral or the portion thereof in which the Program Agent's security interest has been released or terminated. 47
SECTION 2.17. Take-Out Securitizations. The Borrower may, upon no less than five (5) Business Day's prior written notice to the Administrative Agents and the Hedge Counterparties, request that certain Collateral be released from the Program Agent's security interest in order to effect a Take-Out Securitization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Take-Out Securitization shall be permitted unless the proceeds received in connection with any Take-Out Securitization are remitted directly to the Collection Account pursuant to Section 2.08(a) and applied in accordance with the priority of payment provisions set forth in Section 2.08(b) on the immediately following Settlement Date (or, if such Take-Out Securitization occurs on a Settlement Date, on such Settlement Date) and that such proceeds are in an aggregate amount not less than the Repurchase Price for the Contracts that are the subject of such Take-Out Securitization together with any additional amount as may be necessary to pay all amounts due to the Hedge Counterparties on such Settlement Date, including any termination payment due on such Settlement Date as a result of such Take-Out Securitization. Prior to any such Take-Out Securitization being effected, the Program Agent and the Administrative Agents shall have received satisfactory evidence that before and after giving effect to such Take-Out Securitization, (A) no Event of Termination, Incipient Event of Termination, Early Amortization Event or an event that but for notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an Early Amortization Event shall have occurred and be continuing, (B) the Aggregate Principal Balance shall not exceed an amount equal to the Borrowing Base, (C) the Overconcentration Amount shall be zero, (D) with respect to the Contracts that are (a) 30 to 60 days past due and (b) 60 to 90 days past due, the percentage of each such category of Contracts remaining as Collateral hereunder after giving effect to the Take-Out Securitization must not exceed the percentage of such Contracts that constituted Collateral hereunder immediately prior to giving effect to such Take-Out Securitization and (E) the transaction documents to which the Borrower is a party and which set forth the terms of the Take-Out Securitization include limited recourse and non-petition provisions for the benefit of the Borrower similar in all material respects to those set forth in Sections 10.09 and 10.11 hereof. In any calculation to be made in connection with a Take-Out Securitization hereunder, the Outstanding Balance of a Contract shall be that set forth in (i) the then most recently delivered Monthly Report in respect of which the related Settlement Date shall have occurred, or (ii) if such Contract was acquired by the Borrower after the last date covered by such Monthly Report, the related Notice of Sale. Upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in this Section 2.17 (except for the application of the proceeds in accordance with Section 2.08(b) as set forth herein), and receipt by the Borrower of the proceeds thereof in an amount not less than the Repurchase Price of the Contracts that are the subject of such Take-Out Securitization, the Program Agent's security interest, on behalf of the Secured Parties, in such Contracts and the Related Security and Collections shall be released. SECTION 2.18. Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Committed Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Committed Lender is a Defaulting Lender: (a) The Unused Fee shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.05 and such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to the payment of any Make-Whole Fee if it remains a Defaulting Lender at the time of any reduction of the Aggregate Commitment pursuant to Section 2.03. 48
(b) The Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 10.01), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. (c) So long as an Event of Termination has not occurred and is continuing, any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender or any member of its Lender Group hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.04 hereof) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender or member, be retained by the Program Agent in a segregated account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Program Agent to (i) the funding or cash collateralization of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender as required by this Agreement, (ii) the funding of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its Pro Rata Share as required by this Agreement, and (iii) if so determined by the Program Agent and the Borrower, be held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender's Lender Group under this Agreement. Amounts held in such segregated account will not accrue Interest or Fees. Any investment income earned from investments in the segregated account shall be retained in the segregated account. (d) In the event that the Program Agent, the Syndication Agents and the Borrower agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Commitments of the Lenders and the Lender Group Limit of the Lender's related Lender Group shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders in its Lender Group as its related Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Share of the Lender Group Limit and all funds held in a segregated account in respect of such Lender Group under Section 2.18(c) shall be released to the Administrative Agent of such Lender Group. SECTION 2.19. Mitigation of Obligations; Replacement of Lender Groups. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Sections 2.11, 2.12 or 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. The Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount otherwise payable under Section 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15 to the extent such amount accrued prior to the date that is 180 days prior to the date of the demand for payment thereof hereunder; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such amounts are retroactive, then such 180-day period shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 49
(b) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender, its related Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agents, require such Lender and its Lender Group to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.03), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee identified by the Borrower that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be a Lender in another Lender Group, if such Lender and its related Lender Group accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Syndication Agents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) such Lender and its related Lender Group shall have received payment of an amount equal to the principal balance of the Loans made by the Lender and its related Lender Group, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to such Lender and its related Lender Group hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such principal balance and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) together with all amounts then held in any segregated account with respect to such Lender Group in accordance with Section 2.18(c).

The Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying margin stock, as defined in Regulation U promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from time to time, and no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used to buy or carry any margin stock. (i) Good Title. The Borrower is the legal and beneficial owner of the Contracts, Related Security and the Collections related thereto purchased by it under the Receivables Sale Agreement, free and clear of any Adverse Claim, except such Adverse Claims created pursuant to the terms of the Facility Documents and Permitted Liens. There have been duly filed all financing statements or other similar instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or any comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect the Borrower's ownership interest in each Contract, the Related Security, and the Collections related thereto. 53
(j) Perfection. This Agreement, together with the filing of the financing statements contemplated hereby, is effective to, and shall transfer to the Program Agent for the benefit of the Lenders (and the Program Agent for the benefit of the Lenders shall acquire from the Borrower) a valid and perfected first priority security interest in the Collateral and the proceeds thereof, free and clear of any Adverse Claim, except such Adverse Claims created pursuant to the terms of the Facility Documents and Permitted Liens.

The Borrower is a Nevada corporation and is a "registered organization" (within the meaning of Section 9-102 of the UCC as in effect in the State of Nevada). (l) Collections. The conditions and requirements set forth in Sections 5.01(j) and 6.06 have at all times been satisfied and duly performed by the Borrower. The Borrower has not granted any Person, other than the Program Agent as contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise contemplated in the Lockbox Agreement, "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of the Lock-Box or Lockbox Account, or the right to take "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of such Lock-Box or Lockbox Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event. The Borrower has taken all steps necessary to ensure that the Program Agent has "control" (within the meaning of Section 8-106(d) of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) over the Collection Account and that the Collection Account is not subject to any Adverse Claim other than Permitted Liens and Adverse Claims in favor of the Secured Parties hereunder.

(n) Names. The Borrower has not used any corporate or other names, trade names or assumed names other than the name in which it has executed this Agreement. (o) Ownership of the Borrower. HDCC owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Borrower. Such capital stock is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and there are no options, warrants or other rights to acquire securities of the Borrower. (p) Investment Company Act. The Borrower is not, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, will not be required to register as, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or any successor statute. (q) Compliance with Law. The Borrower has complied in all material respects with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or agency thereof having jurisdiction over the conduct of its businesses or the ownership of its property (including, without limitation, laws, rules and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing, fair credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices and privacy), except where the failure to so comply with any of the foregoing could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Borrower, the Secured Parties' interest in the Collateral, the collectibility or enforceability of the Contracts generally or any material portion of the Contracts, or the Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the other Facility Documents. (r) Compliance with the Contracts and the Collection Policy. The Borrower has (i) fully performed and complied in all material respects with all provisions, covenants and other promises required to be observed by it under the Contracts pledged hereunder as Collateral and (ii) complied (and has at all times instructed the Servicer to comply) in all material respects with the Collection Policy with regard to each such Contract. (s) Payments to HDCC. With respect to each Contract transferred to the Borrower under the Receivables Sale Agreement, (i) the Borrower has given reasonably equivalent value to HDCC in consideration therefor and such transfer was not made for or on account of an antecedent debt and (ii) such Contract was purchased by the Borrower in full compliance with the terms of the Receivables Sale Agreement. No transfer of any Contract under the Receivables Sale Agreement is or may be voidable under any section of the Bankruptcy Code. (t) Eligible Contracts. Each Contract included in the Collateral is an Eligible Contract as of its respective Cutoff Date. Each of the representations and warranties made in Sections 4.01(l), (m), (n) and (o), Section 4.02(d) and Section 4.03 of the Receivables Sale Agreement is hereunder made by the Borrower. There are a sufficient number of Eligible Contracts and Eligible Post-Sale Contracts constituting Collateral such that the Borrowing Base exceeds the Aggregate Principal Balance. 55
(u) Accounting. The Borrower shall treat the transactions contemplated by the Receivables Sale Agreement as a sale or capital contribution for all purposes, although the Borrower acknowledges that the consolidated financial statements of HDCC and the Borrower shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and, as a result of the consolidation required by GAAP, the transfers will be reflected as a financing by HDCC in its consolidated financial statements; provided, however, that (i) appropriate notations shall be made in any such consolidated financial statements (or in the accompanying notes) to indicate that the Borrower is a separate legal entity from HDCC and to indicate that the Borrower's assets and credit are not available to satisfy the debts and obligations of HDCC, (ii) such assets shall also be listed separately on any balance sheet of the Borrower prepared on a stand alone basis, and (iii) following the occurrence of any Insolvency Event in respect of HDCC, the Contracts and other Contract Assets purportedly conveyed to the Borrower pursuant to the Receivables Sale Agreement would not constitute part of HDCC's estate in bankruptcy. (v) Borrowing Notice. The information regarding the Contracts as set forth in the Borrowing Notice is true and correct as of the applicable Borrowing Date. (w) Contract Schedule. The Contract Schedule delivered to the Borrower in connection with the closing of the predecessor to the Receivables Sale Agreement on December 12, 2008 is true, accurate and complete as of November 30, 2008.

The Administrative Agents shall make reasonable efforts to coordinate Audits. Any Audit provided for herein shall be conducted in accordance with the Servicer's rules respecting safety and security on its premises and without materially disrupting operations. Nothing in this Section 5.03(d) shall affect the obligation of the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting the disclosure of information regarding the Obligors, and the failure of the Servicer to provide access to information as a result of such obligation shall not constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(d).

SECTION 5.04. Negative Covenants of the Servicer. Until the date on which the Borrower Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and this Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms, the Servicer hereby covenants that: (a) Change in Payment Instructions to Obligors. Except as may be required by the Program Agent pursuant to Section 6.06, the Servicer will not make any change in the instructions to Obligors regarding payments to be made to the Lock-Box or Lockbox Account, unless such change is necessary to allow the Servicer to comply with Section 5.03(g). (b) Modifications to Business, Contracts and Collection Policy. The Servicer will not (i) make any change in the character of its business or (ii) permit any change to the Collection Policy that could reasonably be likely to adversely affect the collectibility of the Contracts generally, without the prior consent of the Syndication Agents in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in Section 5.03(a)(vi). Except as provided in Section 6.02(d), the Servicer will not extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms of any Contract other than in accordance with the Collection Policy. 73

ARTICLE VI ADMINISTRATION OF CONTRACTS SECTION 6.01. Designation of the Servicer. (a) The servicing, administering and collection of the Contracts shall be conducted by the Person so designated from time to time in accordance with this Section 6.01. Until the Program Agent, with the consent or at the direction of the Required Lenders, gives notice to the Borrower and the Servicer of the designation of a new Servicer as provided in Section 6.01(b) below, HDCC is hereby designated as, and hereby agrees to perform the duties and obligations of, the Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof. The Borrower hereby grants to the Servicer an irrevocable power of attorney, with full power of substitution, coupled with an interest, to take in the name of the Borrower any and all steps which are necessary or advisable to endorse, negotiate or otherwise realize on any writing or other right of any kind in connection with any Contract or other Collateral. (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Servicer Termination Event, the Program Agent may, with the consent or shall at the direction of the Required Lenders, upon written notice to the parties hereto designate as the Servicer any Person to succeed HDCC (or any successor Servicer) subject to the condition that any such Person so designated shall agree to perform, and shall be qualified to perform, the duties and obligations of the Servicer under each of the Facility Documents to which it is a party. The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it except upon the reasonable determination by the Servicer that (x) the performance of its duties hereunder is no longer permissible under applicable law and (y) there is no reasonable action which the Servicer could take to make the performance of its duties hereunder permissible under applicable law. 74
(c) HDCC and any successor Servicer agrees that, upon its resignation or replacement as the Servicer pursuant to Section 6.01(b) above, it will cooperate with the Borrower, the Program Agent and the successor Servicer in effecting the termination of its responsibilities and rights as the Servicer hereunder, including, without limitation, (i) assisting the successor Servicer in enforcing all rights under the Contracts and Related Security, (ii) transferring, promptly upon receipt, to the successor Servicer, any Collections or other amounts related to the Contracts received by such Servicer, (iii) transferring to the successor Servicer all Records held by or under the control of such Servicer and (iv) permitting the successor Servicer to have access to all tapes, discs, diskettes and related property containing information concerning the Contracts and the Records and taking all actions necessary in its control to permit the successor Servicer to use all computer software (to the extent it is permitted to do so) that may facilitate the successor Servicer's access to and use of such information and acting as data processing agent for such successor Servicer if requested. Upon the resignation or replacement of HDCC as the Servicer, HDCC shall no longer be entitled to the Servicer Fee accruing from and after the effective date of such resignation or replacement. If HDCC or a successor Servicer resigns or is replaced, it shall be entitled to reimbursement for all outstanding Servicer Advances at the time and in the order of priority set forth in Section 2.08(b) and 2.08(c), as applicable, notwithstanding its resignation or termination hereunder. (d) The Servicer may (i) delegate to any of the Servicer's Affiliates some or all of the Servicer's duties hereunder, (ii) delegate to a non-Affiliate discrete portions of its duties hereunder, such as, collection, bankruptcy services, repossession, in order to enable the Servicer to maximize Collections on the Receivables, and (iii) to a non-Affiliate all or substantially all of its duties hereunder with the prior consent of the Syndication Agents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall remain primarily liable for any and all duties delegated in accordance with this clause (d). SECTION 6.02. Duties of the Servicer. (a) The Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all such actions as it deems necessary or advisable to collect all amounts due and related to each Contract from time to time, all in accordance with applicable laws, tariffs, rules, regulations and the Collection Policy. Each of the Borrower, each Lender, each Administrative Agent and the Program Agent hereby appoints as its agent the Servicer, from time to time designated pursuant to Section 6.01, to enforce its respective rights and interests in and under the Contracts and the Related Security. The Servicer (so long as it is HDCC) will at all times apply the same standards and follow the same procedures with respect to the decision to commence litigation with respect to the Contracts, and in prosecuting and litigating with respect to the Contracts, as it applies and follows with respect to motorcycle conditional sales contracts and promissory note and security agreements serviced by it which are not Contracts; provided, however, that from and after the Termination Date, the Servicer shall commence or settle any legal action to enforce collection of any Contract or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security with respect thereto as directed by the Program Agent. In no event shall the Servicer be entitled to make the Program Agent, any Administrative Agent or any Lender a party to any litigation without such Person's express prior written consent. (b) The Servicer shall apply all Collections to the Contracts owed by the applicable Obligors in a timely manner in accordance with the business practices of the Servicer as of the date of this Agreement unless mutually agreed otherwise with the Syndication Agents. In the event the Servicer receives any Collections or other proceeds of the Collateral, it shall set aside and hold in trust for the Borrower and the Secured Parties such Collections and other proceeds for application and remittance in accordance with Section 2.08(a), and it shall remit the same to the Collection Account to the extent required hereunder. 75
(c) The Servicer shall, as soon as practicable following receipt, turn over to the Person entitled thereto collections in respect of any receivable which is not a Contract less, to the extent the Servicer performed any collection or enforcement actions which it was authorized by such Person to perform, all reasonable and appropriate out of pocket costs and expenses of such Servicer incurred in collecting and enforcing such receivable. The Servicer's authorization and obligations hereunder shall terminate on the Business Day immediately after the Final Collection Date. After such termination, if HDCC or an Affiliate thereof was not the Servicer on the date of such termination, the Servicer shall promptly deliver to the Borrower, all books, copies of records and related materials that the Borrower previously provided to the Servicer, or that otherwise have been obtained by the Servicer, in connection with this Agreement. (d) The Servicer may, in accordance with the Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Contract as the Servicer determines to be appropriate to maximize Collections thereof; provided, however, that such extension shall not limit the rights of any Secured Party under this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that, in accordance with the Servicer's customary business practices as they relate to the management of its securitization facilities, the Servicer will recognize a given Contract as being a Defaulted Contract and thereupon mark the Outstanding Balance of such Contract to zero in its books and records. Such internal practices will not impair or diminish (i) the claim of the Borrower against the applicable Obligor for payment in full of such Contract, (ii) any right of the Borrower to realize any Recoveries subsequently made on any Contract so recorded or (iii) the obligation of the Servicer and the Borrower to remit in full to the Collection Account for application in accordance with Section 2.08 any and all such Recoveries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, during the existence of any Event of Termination, the Program Agent shall have the absolute and unlimited right to direct the Servicer to commence or settle any legal action with respect to any Contract or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security; provided, further, that the Servicer shall not release or waive the right to collect the Outstanding Balance of any Contract, except that, with respect to a Contract that has become a Defaulted Contract or has been written-off as uncollectible, the Servicer, consistent with its Collection Policy, may release or waive the right to collect the Outstanding Balance of such Contract in an effort to maximize collections thereon. (e) The Servicer shall hold in trust for the Borrower and the Secured Parties all Records that (i) evidence or relate to the Contracts, the related Contracts and Related Security or (ii) are otherwise necessary or desirable to collect the Contracts and shall, as soon as practicable upon demand of any Administrative Agent or the Program Agent, during the existence of any Event of Termination, deliver or make available to the Program Agent all such Records, at a place selected by the Program Agent. (f) If the Servicer shall have repossessed a Motorcycle on behalf of the Program Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, the Servicer shall either (i) maintain at its expense physical damage insurance with respect to such Motorcycle, or (ii) indemnify the Program Agent against any damage to such Motorcycle prior to resale or other disposition. The Servicer shall not allow such repossessed Motorcycle to be used in an active trade or business, but rather shall dispose of the Motorcycle in a reasonable time in accordance with the Servicer's normal business practices. 76
(g) The Servicer will be entitled to recover all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in liquidating a Contract and disposing of the related Motorcycle. SECTION 6.03. Servicer Advances. The Servicer may, in its sole discretion, advance (a "Servicer Advance") with respect to any Contract on any Settlement Date, any scheduled principal and/or interest payment thereunder which became due during any Monthly Period ending prior to such Settlement Date and was not paid by the Obligor of such Contract as of the close of business on that last day of the most recently ended Monthly Period (unless a Servicer Advance with respect to and in the amount of such scheduled payment has previously been made), subject to its determination that any such Servicer Advance is expected to be recoverable from future payments made by such Obligor. Any such Servicer Advance, if made, shall be remitted to the Collection Account on the Settlement Date following such Monthly Reporting Date. The Servicer shall not be entitled to interest or any other fees on or with respect to Servicer Advances. The Servicer shall be reimbursed its respective Servicer Advance as provided in Sections 2.08(b) and 2.08(c), as applicable. SECTION 6.04. Responsibilities of the Borrower. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower shall (i) perform all of its obligations with respect to the Contracts to the same extent as if a security interest in the Contracts had not been granted hereunder and the exercise by the Program Agent of its rights hereunder shall not relieve the Borrower from such obligations and (ii) pay when due any taxes, including without limitation, sales, excise and personal property taxes payable by it in connection with the Contracts. None of the Program Agent, the Administrative Agents, the Lenders or the Liquidity Providers shall have any obligation or liability with respect to any Contracts or other Collateral, nor shall any of them be obligated to perform any of the obligations of the Borrower thereunder. SECTION 6.05. Further Action Evidencing Program Agent's Interest. Each of the Borrower and the Servicer agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all further action that any Administrative Agent or the Program Agent may reasonably request in order to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the interest of the Program Agent or the Secured Parties granted hereunder or to enable the Program Agent to exercise or enforce any of its or the Secured Parties' rights hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Borrower and the Servicer will (i) code its master data processing records evidencing such Contracts to evidence that a security interest therein has been granted to the Program Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties under this Agreement, and (ii) upon the request of any Administrative Agent or the Program Agent, file such financing statements, continuation statements or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and execute and file such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or appropriate or as the Program Agent or any Administrative Agent may reasonably request. If either the Borrower or the Servicer fails to perform any of its respective agreements or obligations under this Agreement, the Program Agent may (but shall not be required to) itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Program Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Borrower or the Servicer, as applicable, upon the Program Agent's demand therefor. 77
SECTION 6.06. Collections. In the case of any remittances received in the Collection Account that shall have been identified, to the satisfaction of the Servicer, to not constitute Collections or other proceeds of the Contracts or the Related Security, the Servicer shall promptly remit such items to the Person identified to it (or determined by it) as being the owner of such remittances. From and after the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event, the Program Agent may request that the Servicer, and the Servicer thereupon promptly shall instruct all Obligors with respect to the Contracts, to remit all payments thereon directly to the Collection Account and, at all times thereafter, the Borrower and the Servicer shall not deposit or otherwise credit, and shall not permit any other Person to deposit or otherwise credit to the Collection Account any cash or payment item other than Collections or other amounts permitted or required to be deposited therein pursuant to this Agreement. SECTION 6.07. Reports. The Servicer shall prepare and forward to each Administrative Agent (i) on each Monthly Reporting Date, a Monthly Report, and the Servicer shall provide a copy thereof to the Deal Rating Agency and the Hedge Counterparties, (ii) at such times as any Administrative Agent shall reasonably request, a listing by Obligor of all Contracts and (iii) if Provisional Settlement Dates are then in effect, a report substantially in the form of a Monthly Report at such times as any Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. The Servicer shall deliver to each Administrative Agent, the Deal Rating Agency and the Hedge Counterparties: (x) on each Monthly Reporting Date as part of the Monthly Report, information regarding loss-to-liquidations on HDFS's U.S. retail Motorcycle managed portfolio and (y) on a quarterly basis, information regarding delinquencies and annual losses on such managed portfolio. SECTION 6.08. Servicer Fees. In consideration of HDCC's agreement to act as the Servicer hereunder, the Lenders hereby agree that, during the period that HDCC shall perform as the Servicer hereunder, the Borrower shall pay over to HDCC a fee (the "Servicer Fee") on each Settlement Date in accordance with Sections 2.08(b) and 2.08(c), as applicable, which Servicer Fee shall be equal, in respect of any Monthly Period (or portion thereof), to: (i) (A) the sum of the aggregate Outstanding Balance of all Contracts constituting Collateral as of the first day of such period and the aggregate Outstanding Balance of all Contracts constituting Collateral as of the last day of such period, divided by (B) two, times (ii) 1.00%, times (ii) the actual number of days during such period divided by 360. The Servicer shall retain all Late Payment Penalty Fees and extension fees paid in the prior Monthly Period, as compensation for its servicing activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Servicer is replaced by the Program Agent, the successor Servicer shall receive a servicing fee in an amount agreed upon by the Program Agent and the successor Servicer which reflects the then-prevailing market rates for servicing similar portfolios of Contracts. 78

(i) The Borrower shall fail, or shall fail to cause the Servicer, to reduce the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Loans to zero on the Maturity Date then in effect. (j) One or more final judgments for the payment of money in excess of $500,000 in the aggregate shall be entered against the Borrower with respect to which (i) enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by any creditor upon such judgments or orders or (ii) there shall be any period of ten (10) consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgments or orders, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect; provided, however, that any such judgment or order shall not be an Event of Termination or included in the calculation of the aggregate amount of judgments or orders under this Section 7.1(j) if and for so long as (A) the amount of such judgment or order is covered by a valid and binding policy of insurance between the defendant and the insurer covering payment thereof and (B) such insurer, which shall be rated at least "A" by A.M.

(p) A Reserve Account Shortfall shall occur on any date and such failure shall continue unremedied as of the immediately following Settlement Date after giving effect to all distributions made on such Settlement Date in accordance with Section 2.08. SECTION 7.02. Remedies. (a) If an Event of Termination has occurred and is continuing, then the Program Agent shall, at the request, or may with the consent of the Required Lenders by notice to the Borrower, declare the Termination Date to have occurred; provided, however, that, in the case of any event described in Section 7.01(e) above, the Termination Date shall be deemed 80
to have occurred automatically upon the occurrence of such event. Upon the declaration or automatic occurrence of the Termination Date in accordance with this Section 7.02, the Loans and all other obligations of the Borrower hereunder shall become and be immediately due and payable, without any presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower. In addition to the foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Termination, (i) all Borrower Obligations hereunder shall bear interest at the Default Rate, (ii) the Program Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may direct the Servicer to deposit to the Collection Account all Collections received by it within two (2) Business Days in accordance with Section 2.08(a), (iii) the Program Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may exercise exclusive dominion and control over the Collection Account in accordance with Sections 5.01(j) and 5.03(g), and the Reserve Account by delivering the requisite notice of control to the applicable account banks, and following such exercise of control, the Program Agent shall direct all withdrawals and distributions from and to the Collection Account, (iv) the Program Agent may, upon the direction of the Required Lenders, notify the Obligors of the Secured Parties' interest in the Collateral (or direct the Servicer to do so pursuant to Section 6.06) and direct such Obligors to make payment of all amounts due under Contracts as designated by the Program Agent, including making payment directly to the Collection Account, (v) the Program Agent may, upon the direction of the Required Lenders, without notice, demand or advertisement of any kind to the Borrower or any other Person, enter the premises of the Borrower where any Collateral is located (through self-help and without judicial process) to collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate, sell, lease, assign, foreclose, grant an option or options to purchase or otherwise dispose of, deliver, or realize upon, the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales (which sales may be adjourned or continued from time to time with or without notice and may take place at the Borrower's premises or elsewhere), for cash, on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk, and upon such other terms as the Required Lenders may deem commercially reasonable, and the Lenders shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase for the benefit of the Lenders, the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right of equity redemption, which equity redemption the Borrower hereby expressly releases; (vi) if such event described in Section 7.01(g) has occurred with respect to the Servicer, the Program Agent may, with the consent or shall at the direction of the Required Lenders, designate as the Servicer any Person to succeed HDCC (or any successor Servicer), and (vii) the Program Agent and the Secured Parties shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies under this Agreement or otherwise, all other rights and remedies provided under the UCC of the applicable jurisdiction and other applicable laws, which rights shall be cumulative. (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Termination, each of the Borrower and the Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary as reasonably requested by the Program Agent (i) to cause the Program Agent to have all of the rights and remedies of a "Trustee" under and as defined in the Lockbox Agreement, (ii) to cause the Borrower to be treated as or deemed a "Trust" and a "Trust Depositor" under and as defined in the Lockbox Agreement, (iii) to cause the Contracts to be treated as or deemed "CFC Contracts" under and as defined in the Lockbox Agreement and (iv) to obligate HDCC, as servicer under the Lockbox Agreement, to remit to the Collection Account any Collections received in any Lockbox Account that is subject to the Lockbox Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Lockbox Agreement. The Borrower hereby grants to the Program Agent an irrevocable power of attorney, with full power of substitution, coupled with an interest, to take in the name of the Borrower, following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Termination, any and all steps which are necessary or advisable to endorse, negotiate or otherwise realize on any writing or other right of any kind in connection with any Contract or other Contract Asset. 81
(c) The Borrower recognizes that the Lenders may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Collateral and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof. The Borrower acknowledges that any private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall not be deemed to have been made in a commercially unreasonable manner solely by virtue of such sale being private. In the event of any sale, assignment or other transfer of all or any portion of the Collateral by the Lenders in the exercise of their remedies under this Agreement, all rights and obligations of the Servicer hereunder in respect of the servicing, collecting or other handling of the Collateral so sold, assigned or otherwise transferred shall thereupon terminate without any requirement that notice be given to or any payment (other than any then accrued and unpaid Servicer Fees) be made to the Servicer or that any other action on the part of any Person be taken to give effect to such termination. SECTION 7.03. Additional Remedies of the Lenders. (a) During an Early Amortization Period, (i) no new Loans shall be extended by the Lenders hereunder, and (ii) on each Settlement Date, the Target Principal Amount shall be an amount equal to the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Loans then outstanding. (b) If (x) the Aggregate Principal Balance at any time exceeds the Borrowing Base and (y) such circumstance does not constitute an Event of Termination under Section 7.01(o) because it arises solely as a result of a change in the Loss-to-Liquidation Ratio causing an increase in the Dynamic Enhancement Percentage, no new Loans will be extended by the Lenders until such time as such deficiency is eliminated by (i) the pledge of additional Collateral by the Borrower to the Program Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties or (ii) the payment of the Total Distribution Amount by the Borrower, or the Servicer on its behalf, in accordance with Section 2.08(b) hereof such that the Aggregate Principal Balance of the Loans is less than the Borrowing Base. ARTICLE VIII INDEMNIFICATION SECTION 8.01. Indemnities by the Borrower. (a) Without limiting any other rights that the Program Agent, any Administrative Agent or any Lender may have hereunder or under applicable law, the Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify (and pay upon demand to) the Program Agent, each Administrative Agent and each Lender and their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns, officers, directors, agents and employees (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all damages, losses, claims, taxes, liabilities, costs, expenses and for all other amounts payable, including reasonable attorneys' fees (which attorneys may be employees of the Program Agent, such Administrative Agent or such Lender) and disbursements (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as "Indemnified Amounts") awarded against or incurred 82

on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to such Administrative Agent or the Program Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except to the extent provided in Section 9.07, the provisions of this Article IX are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agents, the Program Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have any rights as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise under any of the provisions hereof. In performing their functions and duties hereunder, the Administrative Agents shall act solely as the agent for the respective Conduit Lenders and the Committed Lenders in the related Lender Group and do not assume nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of trust or agency with or for the other Lenders, the Borrower, the Servicer, any Originator, any Affiliate thereof or any of their respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 9.04. Lender's Loan Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Program Agent, any Administrative Agent, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own evaluation and decision to enter into this Agreement and, if it so determines, to make Loans hereunder.

SECTION 9.07. Successor Agents. The Program Agent and each Administrative Agent may, upon five (5) days' notice to the Borrower, each Lender and each other party hereto, resign as Program Agent or Administrative Agent, as applicable. If any such party shall resign as Program Agent or Administrative Agent under this Agreement, then, in the case of the 88

All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall, unless otherwise stated herein, be in writing (including communication by facsimile copy) and shall be personally delivered or sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, or by courier or by facsimile or electronic mail, to each party hereto, at its address set forth on Schedule II hereof or at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties hereto (and in the case of any notice to a Hedge Counterparty hereunder, at the address specified in the applicable Hedge Agreement). All such notices and communications shall be effective, upon receipt, or in the case of overnight courier, two (2) days after being deposited with such courier, or, in the case of notice by facsimile or electronic mail, when electronic confirmation of receipt is obtained, in each case addressed as aforesaid. In the event any written notice or other communication is given by the Borrower or the Servicer solely to the Program Agent, the Program Agent shall promptly provide a copy of such notice or other communication to each Administrative Agent. SECTION 10.03. Assignability. (a) Any Conduit Lender may assign at any time all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and interests herein (i) without the consent of or prior notice to any party hereto, to any one or more of the Committed Lenders in its Lender Group, any Affiliate of its Administrative Agent, any Liquidity Provider for such Conduit Lender or any commercial paper conduit that is administered by the Administrative Agent of its Lender Group or such Administrative Agent's Affiliate, and (ii) with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), to any other Person not listed in clause (i) above; provided that the consent of the Borrower shall not be required if an Event of Termination has occurred and is continuing. (b) Any Administrative Agent may, with notice to the Borrower and the Servicer, and with the consent of the Lenders in its Lender Group, assign at any time all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and interests herein to any Lender or to any Affiliate of such Administrative Agent or any Lender. (c) Any Committed Lender may, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and with the consent of the Administrative Agent for the Lender Group of which it is a member, assign at any time all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and interests herein to any Person; provided, however, that the consent of the Borrower shall not be required in connection with any assignment by a Committed Lender (i) if an Event of Termination has occurred and is continuing or (ii) to any other Lender or any Affiliate of such Committed Lender. (d) With respect to any assignment hereunder, the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Program Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register (as defined below), an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $2,500. 91
Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent that rights and obligations under this Agreement have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder and (y) the assigning Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish such rights and be released from such obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). (e) At all times during which any Loan is outstanding, the Program Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.02 of this Agreement (or such other address of the Program Agent notified by the Program Agent to the other parties hereto) a register as provided herein (the "Register"). The Aggregate Principal Balance and any interests therein, and any Assignments and Acceptances of the Aggregate Principal Balance or any interest therein delivered to and accepted by the Program Agent, shall be registered in the Register, and the Register shall serve as a record of ownership that identifies the owners of the Aggregate Principal Balances and any interests therein. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no transfer of the Aggregate Principal Balances or any interest therein shall be effective unless and until such transfer has been recorded in the Register. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Servicer, the Program Agent, the Administrative Agents and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement. This Section 10.03(e) shall be construed so that the Aggregate Principal Balance and any interest therein is maintained at all times in "registered form" within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h) and 881(c) of the IRC. Solely for the purposes of this Section 10.03, the Program Agent will act as an agent of the Borrower. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Servicer or any Administrative Agent at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (f) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance, the Program Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been duly completed, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. (g) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder (including the outstanding Loan); provided, that following the sale of a participation under this Agreement, (i) the obligations of such Lender shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Program Agent, the Servicer and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which such Lender sells such a participation shall provide that the Participant shall not have any right to direct the enforcement of this Agreement or the other Facility Documents or to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Facility Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (i) reduces the amount of principal or Interest that is payable on account of any Loan or delays any 92
scheduled date for payment thereof or (ii) reduces any fees payable by the Borrower to the Program Agent or such Lender's Administrative Agent, as applicable (to the extent relating to payments to the Participant) or delays any scheduled date for payment of such fees. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any Lender's source of funds may derive in part from its Participants. Accordingly, references in Sections 2.11 through 2.15 and the other terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Facility Documents to determinations, reserve and capital adequacy requirements, expenses, increased costs, reduced receipts and the like as they pertain to the Lenders shall be deemed also to include those of its Participants; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be liable to any Participant under Sections 2.11 through 2.15 for an amount in excess of that which would be payable to the applicable Lender under such sections at such time. (h) Neither the Borrower nor the Servicer may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Program Agent and each Administrative Agent. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights (including, without limitation, rights to payment of the principal balance of the Loans made by it and Interest with respect thereto) hereunder pursuant to repurchase transactions or other financing transactions as part of such Lender's ordinary course of business, including to secure obligations of such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank, without notice to or consent of the Borrower or the Program Agent; provided that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or grantee for such Lender as a party hereto. SECTION 10.04. Additional Lender Groups. Upon the Borrower's request with approval of the Syndication Agents, an additional Lender Group may be added to this Agreement at any time by the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement by the members of such proposed additional Lender Group, the Borrower, and the Syndication Agents. Upon the effective date of such Joinder Agreement, (i) each Person specified therein as a "Conduit Lender" shall become a party hereto as a Conduit Lender, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Conduit Lender hereunder, (ii) each Person specified therein as a "Committed Lender" shall become a party hereto as a Committed Lender, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Committed Lender hereunder, (iii) each Person specified therein as an "Administrative Agent" shall become a party hereto as an Administrative Agent, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of an Administrative Agent hereunder and (iv) the Aggregate Commitment shall be increased by an amount equal to the aggregate Commitments of the Committed Lenders party to such Joinder Agreement. SECTION 10.05. Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal court sitting in New York City in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each party hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent they may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. The parties 93
hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. (b) Each party hereto hereby consents to the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to it at its address specified in Section 10.02. Nothing in this Section 10.05 shall affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. SECTION 10.06. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER FACILITY DOCUMENT. SECTION 10.07. Right of Setoff. Each Lender is hereby authorized (in addition to any other rights it may have) at any time after the occurrence of the Termination Date due to the occurrence of an Event of Termination, or at any time that any Borrower Obligation hereunder is due and payable, to set off, appropriate and apply (without presentment, demand, protest or other notice which are hereby expressly waived) any deposits and any other indebtedness held or owing by such Lender to, or for the account of, the Borrower against the amount of the Borrower Obligations owing by the Borrower to such Lender. Each Lender is hereby authorized (in addition to any other rights it may have) at any time after the occurrence of either a Servicer Termination Event or the Termination Date due to the occurrence of an Event of Termination, or at any time that any payment obligation of the Servicer hereunder is due and payable, to set off, appropriate and apply (without presentment, demand, protest or other notice which are hereby expressly waived) any deposits and any other indebtedness held or owing by such Lender to, or for the account of, the Servicer against the amount of such obligations owing by the Servicer to such Lender. SECTION 10.08. Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it with respect to any Borrower Obligations or obligation of the Servicer in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender entitled to receive a ratable share of such amount, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase for cash without recourse or warranty a portion of such Borrower Obligations or Servicer obligation held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of such Borrower Obligations or Servicer obligations, as applicable; provided, that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. SECTION 10.09. Limitation of Liability. (a) Except with respect to any claim arising out of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any Lender, any Administrative Agent, the Program Agent or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agents (each a "Lender Party"), 94
no claim may be made by any Transaction Party or any other Person against any Lender Party for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Facility Document, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection herewith or therewith; and each of the Borrower and the Servicer hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the obligations of the Conduit Lenders under this Agreement are solely the corporate obligations of each such Conduit Lender and shall be payable only at such time as funds are actually received by, or are available to, such Conduit Lender in excess of funds necessary to pay in full all outstanding Promissory Notes issued by such Conduit Lender and, to the extent funds are not available to pay such obligations, the claims relating thereto shall not constitute a claim against such Conduit Lender until such funds for such purpose thereafter become available. Each party hereto agrees that the payment of any claim (as defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code) of any such party shall be subordinated to the payment in full of all Promissory Notes. (c) No recourse under any obligation, covenant or agreement of any Conduit Lender contained in this Agreement shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director, member, manager, employee or agent of such Conduit Lender or any of its Affiliates (solely by virtue of such capacity) by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that this Agreement is solely a corporate obligation of such Conduit Lender, and that no personal liability whatever shall attach to or be incurred by any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director, member, manager, employee or agent of any Conduit Lender or any of its Affiliates (solely by virtue of such capacity) or any of them under or by reason of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements of such Conduit Lender contained in this Agreement, or implied therefrom, and that any and all personal liability for breaches by any Conduit Lender of any of such obligations, covenants or agreements, either at common law or at equity, or by statute, rule or regulation, of every such incorporator, stockholder, officer, director, member, manager, employee or agent is hereby expressly waived as a condition of and in consideration for the execution of this Agreement; provided that the foregoing shall not relieve any such Person from any liability it might otherwise have as a result of fraudulent actions taken or fraudulent omissions made by them. SECTION 10.10. Taxes. The Borrower shall pay any and all stamp, sales, transfer and other taxes (including income and franchise taxes) and fees (including, without limitation, UCC filing fees and any penalties associated with the late payment of any UCC filing fees) payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution, delivery, filing and recording of this Agreement or the other agreements and documents to be delivered hereunder (including any UCC financing statements) and agrees to indemnify the Program Agent, the Administrative Agents, the Lenders and the Liquidity Providers against any liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay by the Borrower in paying or omission to pay such taxes and fees. 95
SECTION 10.11. No Proceedings. The Borrower, the Servicer, each Lender, each Administrative Agent and the Program Agent each hereby agrees that it will not institute against any Conduit Lender any proceeding of the type referred to in Section 7.01(e) so long as any Promissory Notes of such Conduit Lender shall be outstanding or there shall not have elapsed one year plus one day since the last day on which any such Promissory Notes shall have been outstanding. SECTION 10.12. Confidentiality. (a) By accepting delivery of this Agreement, the Borrower agrees not to disclose to any person or entity the contents of any Monthly Report, except (i) to the other parties to this Agreement, (ii) to any Hedge Counterparty, (iii) to its and its Affiliates' officers, directors, employees, agents, accountants, legal counsel and other representatives (collectively, the "Borrower Representatives") who have a need to know for the purpose of assisting in the negotiation, completion and performance of this Agreement, and who agree (or are deemed to agree) to be bound by the provisions of this section applicable to the Borrower, (iii) in connection with any legal or regulatory action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the exercise of any remedies hereunder, (iv) to the extent required by applicable law, regulation, subpoena or other legal process, (v) to the extent requested by any governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Borrower, any Originator or any Borrower Representative, and (vi) to any Rating Agencies.

The Program Agent, the Administrative Agents and each Lender, as the case may be, will be responsible for any failure of any related Lender Representative to comply with the provisions of this clause (b). 96

SECTION 10.13. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Program Agent, any Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Liquidity Provider to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. SECTION 10.14. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. SECTION 10.15. Execution in Counterparts.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns (including any trustee in bankruptcy). Any provisions of this Agreement which are prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Agreement shall create and constitute the continuing obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms and shall remain in full force and effect until the Final Collection Date; provided, however, that the provisions of Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and Article VIII, and the provisions of Sections 10.05, 10.06, 10.08, 10.09, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14, 10.15 and this Section 10.16 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 97

The Borrower shall, out of the proceeds of the initial Advance made under this Agreement repay in full such outstanding "Borrower Obligations" under the Existing Credit Agreement. To give effect to the termination of the Existing Credit Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.18, the parties to the Existing Credit Agreement waive any requirement that any prior notice be provided under the Existing Credit Agreement, or that a prepayment occur on a settlement date thereunder. SECTION 10.19. Third Party Beneficiaries. Each Hedge Counterparty shall be a third party beneficiary to this Agreement solely for purposes of Sections 2.08, 2.16 and 10.02, and shall be entitled to the rights and benefits thereunder.

RATED NOTE $[______] [______], 2009 Harley-Davidson Warehouse Funding Corp., a Nevada corporation (the "Borrower"), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY TO THE ORDER OF [_________] (the "Lender") the principal sum of [_________] DOLLARS ($[______]) or, if less, the unpaid Principal Balance of its portion of the Loans funded or maintained by the Lender to or for the benefit of the Borrower under the below-described Loan and Servicing Agreement. The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid Principal Balance of such Loans for each day outstanding until such Principal Balance is paid in full, at such interest rates, and payable at such times, as are specified in the Loan and Servicing Agreement. All payments of principal and interest by the Borrower hereunder shall be made in immediately available funds for the benefit of the Lender at the designated office of its Administrative Agent under the Loan and Servicing Agreement and on the dates set forth in the Loan and Servicing Agreement.
