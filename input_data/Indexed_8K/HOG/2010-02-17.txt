On February 10, 2010, the Human Resources Committee (the "HR Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (the "Company"), as administrator of the Company's 2009 Incentive Stock Plan (the "Plan"), approved a general form of option award agreement, a general form of restricted stock award agreement and additional related forms of award agreements for particular uses under the Plan. Each of the forms contemplates vesting of the related award on a pro rata basis on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition, if a participant ceases to be employed by the Company and its affiliates on or after age 55 and after the first anniversary of the date of grant, then the award generally vests in full. Also on February 10, 2010, the Committee (and, in the case of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board) approved equity awards to approximately 615 employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, including executive officers and management, of (i) options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company under the Plan for which the general form of option agreement or a substantially similar form of option agreement serves as the award agreement and (ii) restricted shares of common stock of the Company under the Plan for which the general form of restricted stock award agreement or a substantially similar form of restricted stock award agreement serves as the award agreement.
 
Effective February 11, 2010, the Board approved amendments to the By-Laws of the Company, as amended (the "By-Laws"), to enhance financial ownership disclosure by requiring more detailed disclosure about the beneficial share ownership and true financial interests of any shareholder that desires to propose a business matter or director nominee to be considered at a meeting of shareholders. The material amendments to the By-Laws are described below.
Article VI, Section (b) of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles") contains a process by which a shareholder of the Company may propose nominees for election to the Board, and Article IX of the Articles contains a process by which a shareholder of the Company may submit other business before an annual or special meeting of shareholders, other than a matter properly brought under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The amendments to Section 1.01 of the By-Laws and related changes in Section 1.02 of the By-Laws expand the scope of financial ownership information that a shareholder must provide when nominating a person for election as a director or bringing other business before a meeting of shareholders pursuant to the advance notice provisions of the Articles. A shareholder must disclose, among other things, all direct or indirect ownership interests, including dividend and voting rights, in any class or series of equity securities of the Company and any proxy, agreement, arrangement or relationship pursuant to which a shareholder has the right to vote any shares of any equity security of the Company.
The foregoing description of the material amendments to the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-Laws which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A "Soliciting Shareholder" shall also mean each Affiliate of a Soliciting Shareholder described in clause (A) or (B) above who is a member of such Soliciting Shareholder's "group" for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act, and any other Affiliate of such a Soliciting Shareholder, if a majority of the directors then in office determine, reasonably and in good faith, that such Affiliate should be required to sign the written notice described in paragraph (c) of this Section 1.02 and/or the written agreement described in this paragraph (d) in order to prevent the purposes of this Section 1.02 from being evaded.
