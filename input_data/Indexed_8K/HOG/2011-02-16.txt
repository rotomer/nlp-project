Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On February 10, 2011, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment to Section 2.07 of the Company's By-laws to provide that no person may be elected as a director of the Company after such person's 72nd birthday, except as may otherwise be approved by the Board in advance of such election. This amendment replaces the prior provision mandating the automatic retirement of a director upon the commencement of the annual meeting of the Company's shareholders following such director's 72nd birthday. In light of the strategic transformation being undertaken by the Company, the Board believes that retaining the retirement policy for directors while allowing for discretion by the Board to make exceptions to the policy when it deems it to be in the best interests of the Company is a prudent balance of succession planning for members of the Board and ensuring continuity in the leadership of the Company.
The foregoing description of the amendment to the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-Laws which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
 
 
(3.1)    Harley-Davidson, Inc. By-laws, as amended through February 10, 2011.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A "Soliciting Shareholder" shall also mean each Affiliate of a Soliciting Shareholder described in clause (A) or (B) above who is a member of such Soliciting Shareholder's "group" for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act, and any other Affiliate of such a Soliciting Shareholder, if a majority of the directors then in office determine, reasonably and in good faith, that such Affiliate should be required to sign the written notice described in paragraph (c) of this Section 1.02 and/or the written agreement described in this paragraph (d) in order to prevent the purposes of this Section 1.02 from being evaded.
