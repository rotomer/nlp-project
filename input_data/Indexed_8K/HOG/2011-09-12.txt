On September 8, 2011, the Board of Directors of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (the "Company") approved Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Restated Articles") for the Company. The restatement included an amendment to the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended through May 3, 2011 (the "Current Articles"), removing Section (c) of Article IV of the Current Articles to eliminate the Company's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred"). The terms of the Series A Preferred provided for 500,000 shares of preferred stock, each share of which was entitled to 10,000 votes per share (subject to adjustment) and other rights such that the value of a one ten-thousandth interest in a share of Series A Preferred would approximate the value of one share of the Company's common stock. No shares of Series A Preferred had been issued. Under applicable law, it was not necessary for shareholders of the Company to approve the amendment or the restatement.
The Company filed the Restated Articles with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions on September 9, 2011, and the Restated Articles became effective upon the date of filing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
The name of the Corporation is Harley-Davidson, Inc.
The registered agent and registered office of the Corporation is CT Corporation System, 8040 Excelsior Dr., Suite 200, Madison, Wisconsin 53717.
The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law.
(a) AUTHORIZED SHARES. The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is eight hundred two million (802,000,000), consisting of (i) eight hundred million (800,000,000) shares of Common Stock of $.01 par value ("Common Stock"), and (ii) two million (2,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock of $1.00 par value.
All cross references in each Subdivision of this ARTICLE IV refer to other paragraphs in such subdivision unless otherwise indicated.
(i) Voting Rights. The holders of Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by the Corporation's shareholders.
(ii) Registration of Transfer. The Corporation shall keep at its principal office (or such other place as the Corporation reasonably designates) a register for the registration of shares of Common Stock. Upon the surrender of any certificate representing shares of Common Stock at such place, the Corporation shall, at the request of the registered holder of such certificate, execute and deliver (at the Corporation's expense) a new certificate or certificates in exchange therefor representing in the aggregate the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the surrendered certificate (and the Corporation forthwith shall cancel such surrendered certificate), subject to the requirements of applicable securities laws. Each such new certificate shall be registered in such name and shall represent such number of shares as shall be requested by the holder of the surrendered certificate and shall be substantially identical in form to the surrendered certificate.
(iii) Replacement.
(A) Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation (an affidavit of the registered holder without bond shall be satisfactory) of the ownership and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any certificate evidencing one or more shares of Common Stock and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender of such certificate, the Corporation shall, at the expense of the registered holder, execute and deliver in lieu of such certificate a new certificate of like kind representing the number of shares of Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate and dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate.
(B) The term "outstanding" when used in this ARTICLE IV with reference to the shares of Common Stock as of any particular time shall not include any such shares represented by any certificate in lieu of which a new certificate has been executed and delivered by the Corporation in accordance with paragraph (ii) or this paragraph (iii), but shall include only those shares represented by such new certificate.
(iv) DISSOLUTION. Upon the dissolution of the Corporation, after there shall have been paid to or set aside for the holders of shares of Preferred Stock the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled, if any, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive pro rata the remaining net assets of the Corporation.
(b) PREFERRED STOCK. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series in any manner permitted by law and the provisions of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuances thereof, prior to the issuances of any shares thereof. Unless otherwise provided in the resolution establishing a series of Preferred Stock, prior to the issue of any shares of a series so established or to be established, the Board of Directors may, by resolution, amend the relative rights and preferences of the shares of such series.
The designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of each class of stock shall be governed by the following provisions:
(i) The Board of Directors is expressly authorized at any time, and from time to time, to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, with such voting powers, full or limited, or without voting powers and with such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue thereof adopted by the Board of Directors, including (but not limiting the generality thereof) the following:
(A) The number of shares to constitute each such series, and the designation of each such series.
 
(B) The dividend rate of each such series, the conditions and dates upon which such dividends shall be payable, the relation which such dividends shall bear to the dividends payable on any other class or classes or on any other series of any class or classes of stock, and whether such dividends shall be cumulative or non-cumulative.

(D) The terms and amount of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of the shares of each such series.
(E) Whether or not the shares of each such series shall be convertible into or exchangeable for shares of any other class or classes or any other series of any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation, and, if provision be made for conversion or exchange, the times, prices, rates of exchange, adjustments, and other terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange.
(F) The extent, if any, to which the holders of the shares of each such series shall be entitled to vote with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.
(G) The restrictions, if any, on the issue or reissue of any additional Preferred Stock.
(H) The rights of the holders of the shares of each such series upon the dissolution of, or upon the distribution of the assets of, the Corporation.

(whether or not an Interested Shareholder) which is, or after such merger or consolidation would be, an Affiliate (as hereinafter defined) of an Interested Shareholder; or
(B) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or in a series of transactions) to or with any Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Shareholder of all or a Substantial Part of the assets of the Corporation (including, without limitation, any securities of a Subsidiary) or any Subsidiary; or

(E) any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split), or recapitalization of the Corporation, or any merger of the Corporation with any of its Subsidiaries or any share exchange to which the Corporation is a party or any self tender offer for or repurchase of securities of the Corporation by the Corporation or any Subsidiary or any other transaction (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving an Interested Shareholder) which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity or convertible securities of the Corporation or any Subsidiary which is directly or indirectly owned by any Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate of any Interested Shareholder,
shall require a vote of the holders of the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Voting Stock") (it being understood that for purposes of this ARTICLE V, each share of the Voting Stock shall have the number of votes granted to it pursuant to ARTICLE IV of these Restated Articles of Incorporation) where the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required, or that a lesser percentage may be specified, by law or by these Restated Articles of Incorporation or in any agreement with any national securities exchange or otherwise.
(ii) The term "Business Combination" as used in this ARTICLE V shall mean any transaction which is referred to in any one or more of subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (i) of this Section (a).
(b) WHEN VOTE UNDER ARTICLE V IS NOT REQUIRED. The provisions of Section (a) of this ARTICLE V shall not be applicable to any particular Business
 
Combination, and such Business Combination shall require only such affirmative vote as is required by law, any other provision of these Restated Articles of Incorporation or any agreement with any national securities exchange, if, in the case of a Business Combination that does not involve any cash or other consideration being received by the shareholders of the Corporation, solely in their respective capacities as shareholders of the Corporation, the condition specified in the following paragraph (i) is met, or, in the case of any other Business Combination, the conditions specified in either of the following paragraphs (i) and (ii) are met:
(i) The Business Combination shall have been approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined).
(ii) Each of the five conditions specified in the following subparagraphs (A) through (E) shall have been met:
(A) The aggregate amount of the cash and the Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) as of the date of consummation of the Business Combination of consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders of each class of Voting Stock in such Business Combination shall be at least equal to the higher of the following:
(I) (if applicable) the Highest Per Share Price (as hereinafter defined) (including the brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid in order to acquire any shares of such class of Voting Stock beneficially owned by the Interested Shareholder which were acquired beneficially by such Interested Shareholder (x) within the two-year period immediately prior to the first public announcement of the proposal of the Business Combination (the "Announcement Date") or (y) in the transaction in which it became an Interested Shareholder, whichever is higher; or
(II) the Fair Market Value per share of such class of Voting Stock on the Announcement Date or on the date on which the Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder (such latter date is referred to in this ARTICLE V as the "Determination Date"), whichever is higher; or
(III) an amount which bears the same or greater percentage relationship to the Fair Market Value of such class of Voting Stock on the Announcement Date as the Highest Per Share Price determined in (ii) (A) (I) above bears to the Fair Market Value of such class of Voting Stock on the date of the commencement of the acquisition of Voting Stock by such Interested Shareholder.
(B) The consideration to be received by holders of the outstanding Voting Stock shall be in cash or in the same form as was previously paid in order to acquire beneficially shares of Voting Stock that are beneficially owned by the Interested Shareholder. If the Interested Shareholder beneficially owns shares of
 
Voting Stock that were acquired with varying forms of consideration, the form of consideration to be received by holders of Voting Stock shall be either cash or the form used to acquire beneficially the largest number of shares of Voting Stock beneficially acquired by it prior to the Announcement Date.
(C) After such Interested Shareholder has become an Interested Shareholder and prior to consummation of such Business Combination: (I) there shall have been (x) no reduction in the annual rate of dividends paid on the Voting Stock (except as necessary to reflect any subdivision of the Voting Stock), except as approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, and (y) an increase in such annual rate of dividends as necessary to reflect any reclassification (including any reverse stock split), recapitalization, reorganization or any similar transaction which has the effect of reducing the number of outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, unless the failure so to increase such annual rate is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors; and (II) such Interested Shareholder shall have not become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of Voting Stock except as part of the transaction which resulted in such Interested Shareholder becoming an Interested Shareholder.
(D) After such Interested Shareholder has become an Interested Shareholder, such Interested Shareholder shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by the Corporation, whether in anticipation of or in connection with such Business Combination or otherwise.
(E) A proxy or information statement describing the proposed Business Combination and complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations) shall be mailed to shareholders of the Corporation at least 30 days prior to the consummation of such Business Combination (whether or not such proxy or information statement is required to be mailed pursuant to such Act or subsequent provisions).

(e) NO EFFECT ON FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS OF INTERESTED SHAREHOLDERS. Nothing contained in this ARTICLE V shall be construed to relieve any Interested Shareholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.
(a) BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
(i) NUMBER, TERM AND QUALIFICATION. The authorized number of directors of the Corporation which shall constitute the entire Board of Directors shall be such as from time to time shall be determined by a majority of the then authorized number of directors, but in no case shall the authorized number of directors be less than six nor more than fifteen. Until the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation held in 2010, the directors shall be divided with respect to the time for which they severally hold office into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible (but with not less than two directors in each class), as determined by the Board of Directors, with the members of each class to hold office until their successors have been elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of shareholders prior to the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation held in 2010, the successors of the members of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders held in the third year following the year of their election. Commencing with the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation held in 2010, directors shall hold office for terms as follows: (i) at the 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, directors for whom such annual meeting is the annual meeting of shareholders held in the third year following the year of their election (or such directors' successors) shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified, (ii) at the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, directors for whom such annual meeting is the annual meeting of shareholders held in the third year following the year of their election and directors elected at the 2010 annual meeting of shareholders (or such directors' successors) shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified, and (iii) at the 2012 annual meeting of shareholders and each annual meeting of shareholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
 
(ii) REMOVAL. Any director may be removed from office by the shareholders, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes then entitled to be cast in an election of directors.
(iii) VACANCIES. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, including, but not limited to, a vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors or the removal of a director, shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even if such majority is less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by a sole remaining director. If no director remains in office, any vacancy may be filled by the shareholders. Any director elected to fill a vacancy prior to the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation held in 2010 shall serve until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen. Any director elected to fill a vacancy after the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation held in 2010 shall serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders, except that any director who is replacing a director who was in the course of serving a three-year term shall serve for the remainder of the predecessor's term.
(b) NOMINATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS OF DIRECTORS. Nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. However, any shareholder entitled to vote generally in the election of directors may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such shareholder's intent to make such nominations has been given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Corporation not later than (i) with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of shareholders, 60 calendar days in advance of the date in the current fiscal year of the Corporation corresponding to the date the Corporation released its proxy statement to shareholders in connection with the annual meeting for the immediately preceding year and (ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, the close of business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first given to shareholders. Each such notice shall set forth: (A) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated, (B) a representation that the shareholder is entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (C) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder, (D) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the then current proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, if the nominee were to be nominated by the Board and (E) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected. The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure. The directors shall be at least twenty-one years of age. Directors need not be shareholders. At each meeting of shareholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, the persons receiving a plurality of the votes cast shall be elected directors.
 
The shareholders shall not be entitled to take action without a meeting by less than unanimous consent. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the express rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, annual and special meetings of the shareholders shall be called, the record date or dates shall be determined and notice shall be sent as set forth in the By-laws of the Corporation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Restated Articles of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser affirmative vote may be specified by law), the affirmative vote of shareholders possessing at least eighty percent of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of all classes of stock of the Corporation generally possessing voting rights in elections of directors, considered for this purpose as one class, shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, sections 1.02, 1.04 and 1.05 of Article I of the By-laws, or this ARTICLE VII or any provision thereof or hereof; provided, however, that the Board of Directors, may amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, sections 1.02, 1.04 and 1.05 of Article I of the By-laws, or any provision thereof, without a vote of shareholders.
Annual meetings of shareholders shall be held, at a date, time and place fixed by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of meeting, to elect a Board of Directors and to transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting. Special meetings of shareholders may be called only in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE VII of these Restated Articles of Incorporation. At each meeting of shareholders only such business may be conducted as is (a) specified in the written notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) in the case of an annual meeting, brought before the meeting by the Board of Directors or by the chairman of the meeting or (c) in the case of an annual meeting, specified in a written notice given by or on behalf of a shareholder of record, provided that written notice of such shareholder's intent to make a proposal or proposals has been given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Corporation not later than 60 calendar days in advance of the date in the current fiscal year of the Corporation corresponding to the date the Corporation released its proxy statement to shareholders in connection with the annual meeting for the immediately preceding year. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the proposal and the number of shares of the Corporation's capital stock owned or controlled by such shareholder, (b) a representation that the shareholder is entitled to vote at such annual meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to make the proposal specified in the notice and (c) such other information regarding each proposal made by such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the then current proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to such proposals. The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge any proposal not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.
