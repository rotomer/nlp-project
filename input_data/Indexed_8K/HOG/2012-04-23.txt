Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 20, 2012, the Motorcycle Industry Council released to its members certain information regarding the motorcycle industry in the United States, including Harley-Davidson, Inc. (the "Company"), subject to terms of applicable restricted use agreements. The Company learned that one of the members of the Motorcycle Industry Council, in apparent violation of those terms, disclosed information in a research update, presumably based on the contents of the Motorcycle Industry Council report. While the Company will not confirm the contents of the research report, the Company is confirming that U.S. retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles by independent dealers were up 25.5% for the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. The Company must rely on information that its dealers supply concerning retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and this information is subject to revision.
As previously disclosed, the Company is scheduled to release its first quarter 2012 financial results before market hours on Wednesday, April 25, 2012. The public is invited to attend a webcast conference call and downloadable slide presentation with Keith Wandell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Olin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Harley-Davidson, Inc. from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM (Central Time) on April 25, 2012.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
