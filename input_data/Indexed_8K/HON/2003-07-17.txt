Exhibit 99 [HONEYWELL LETTERHEAD] News Release Contact: Media Investors Rich Silverman Dan Gallagher 973-455-4732 973-455-2222 richard.silverman@honeywell.com an.gallagher@honeywell.com HONEYWELL'S SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE 37 CENTS; CASH FROM OPERATIONS $553 MILLION o Revenues of $5.7 billion, up 2% vs. 2002 o Free cash flow of $382 million equals 120% of net income o More than $1.3 billion in new Aerospace contracts announced at Paris Air Show o Continued progress on Specialty Materials portfolio MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., July 17, 2003 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced second-quarter earnings per share of 37 cents, in line with prior earnings guidance. The results are 19 cents below the same period last year, due to nine cents worth of higher pension expense, including the effect of dilution from the prior year's contribution of shares to the company's pension plans; four cents from lower sales in higher margin businesses; and four cents from increased product development and other expenses. Revenues of $5.7 billion were up 2% from the previous year, driven by 4% of foreign currency translation. Free cash flow of $382 million includes the impact of a $170 million voluntary pension contribution. "The results for the second quarter represent solid performance for Honeywell with good revenues, earnings and cash flow in a difficult economic environment," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. "We continue to be focused on executing key strategies, improving customer service, reducing cycle times and investing to support our growth initiatives. The results from the quarter reflect the determination of our management team and the efforts of Honeywell employees worldwide." Segment profit margins were 8.8%, compared with 12.2% in the same period last year. The increase in pension costs accounted for 1.5 percentage points of the change with the remainder primarily due to declines in commercial aerospace and increased product development and administrative expenses. Free cash flow equaled 120% of net income with working capital contributing approximately $100 million in the quarter after adjusting for the non-cash impact of foreign currency translation. Cash and cash equivalents reached $2.6 billion, resulting in net debt of $2.8 billion, or 22% of net capital. -MORE-
2-results "The second quarter also featured significant progress in each of our businesses," Mr. Cote said. "In addition to the $1.3 billion in new contracts announced at the Paris Air Show, Honeywell's Aerospace business received an order for Primus Epic integrated cockpits for 85 to 135 new Embraer regional jets purchased by US Airways. In another highlight, Primus Epic obtained its first government approval as part of the Bell/Agusta AB139 helicopter's certification in Italy. "During the quarter in our Automation and Control Solutions business (ACS), cumulative orders climbed above $240 million for the Experion PKS'TM' process control system. Our turbocharger business had its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, exhibiting strength in all geographic regions. And, we took an important step in the reorganization of our Specialty Materials business by completing transactions with BASF. "We also named a highly regarded financial professional to be our new Chief Financial Officer. Dave Anderson's credibility and experience in global corporate finance will help Honeywell chart its course for the future." * * * * * Second-Quarter Segment Highlights Aerospace o Revenues were down 2% compared with the second quarter of 2002, primarily as a result of commercial aerospace. o Segment margins were 10.4%, down from 16.5%, due to lower sales of commercial original equipment and higher-margin commercial spare parts, as well as higher pension costs. o The company announced more than $1.3 billion in new orders at the Paris Air Show, including contract wins to supply avionics, auxiliary power units, and wing anti-ice valves on easyJet's 120 Airbus A319 aircraft; Primus Epic integrated cockpits for 100 to 200 new Embraer regional aircraft purchased by JetBlue; avionics for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; pneumatics for General Electric's GP7200 engine for the Airbus A380 as well as engine accessories and valves for GE engines that power the U.S. Air Force C5 transport; and weather radar for the U.S. Air Force's fleet of C-17 "Globemaster" transport aircraft. o The Federal Aviation Administration selected the company to provide development, manufacturing, airport installation, training and support for the new satellite-based precision approach and landing system known as the Local Area Augmentation System, a program with a lifetime value that, with the exercise of contract options, could exceed $350 million. -MORE-
3-results Automation and Control Solutions o Revenues were up 4% compared with the second quarter of 2002, due mostly to acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation. o Segment margins were 9.6%, compared with 12.5% in the second quarter of 2002, driven by increased pension costs, a decline in higher margin sales in ACS' service business and increased research and development and other expenses. o ACS' service business announced a new contract to supply and install advanced fire detection and life safety systems at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport - the latest in a series of integrated offerings to airport authorities worldwide. o Frost & Sullivan, a global leader in market research, named ACS the 2003 Industrial Controls Solutions Company of the Year, attributing the success to products such as the Experion PKS'TM' process control system that automates, controls and monitors manufacturing operations. Transportation Systems o Revenues increased 15% year-over-year driven by continued strong growth in turbochargers and favorable foreign currency translation. o Turbocharger sales continued to be strong in all regions as Europe increased 34%, North America increased 30% and Asia increased 17%. o Segment margins were 12.1%, compared with 12.9% a year ago, primarily reflecting increased pension costs and new product development and introduction expenses. o The company announced a $29.1 million agreement with BorgWarner to extend the current license agreement on Honeywell's innovative variable geometric turbocharger technology in order to avoid any disruptions to automotive customers, bringing the aggregate settlement agreement to $54.1 million. Specialty Materials o Revenues were down 5%, compared with the second quarter of 2002, due largely to the disposition of Advanced Circuits and Pharmaceutical Fine Chemicals. o Segment margins of 3.4% were down slightly from the prior year as the benefits of cost actions and divestitures of non-core businesses partially offset lower prices and higher pension and raw material costs. o The group completed two transactions with BASF in which Honeywell sold its engineering plastics business to BASF in exchange for BASF's nylon fiber business and $90 million in cash. o Complementing Honeywell's already strong position in barrier technologies, the company completed its acquisition of Kolon Industries Inc.'s biaxally oriented nylon films facility in Dangjin, South Korea. o Specialty Materials announced an agreement to sell its Metglas Solutions business to Hitachi Metals, Ltd. * * * * * -MORE-

The company also purchased the assets under leases qualifying as variable interest entities resulting in the assumption of $268 million of debt.

10-results Honeywell International Inc. (Dollars in Millions) Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (Unaudited) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and and equipment. We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity. Reconciliation of Operating Income to Segment Profit (Unaudited) We evaluate segment and company performance based on segment profit, which excludes (gains) losses on sales of non-strategic businesses, equity (income) loss, other (income) expense, interest and other financial charges and repositioning, litigation, business impairment and other charges.
