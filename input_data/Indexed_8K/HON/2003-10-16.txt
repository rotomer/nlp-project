[HONEYWELL LOGO] News Release Exhibit 99 Contact: Media Investors Michael Holland Dan Gallagher 973-455-2728 973-455-2222 michael.holland@honeywell.com dan.gallagher@honeywell.com HONEYWELL'S THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE 40 CENTS; CASH FROM OPERATIONS $670 MILLION o Revenues of $5.8 billion, up 3.6% vs. 2002 o Record third-quarter free cash flow of $539 million o Revenues increase in three of Honeywell's four operating segments o Defense & Space and Turbochargers deliver double-digit revenue growth MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., October 16, 2003 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced third-quarter earnings per share of 40 cents, in line with prior earnings guidance. The results are 10 cents below the same period last year, primarily due to higher pension expense, including the effect of dilution from the prior year's contribution of shares to the company's pension plans. Revenues of $5.8 billion were up 3.6% from the previous year, driven primarily by favorable foreign currency translation. Year-to-date cash flow from operations reached $1.7 billion and year-to-date free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) reached $1.3 billion. "We delivered another solid quarter, with revenues and earnings on target and record free cash flow, despite difficult market conditions," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. "We had revenue increases in three of our four operating segments, and our Defense & Space and Turbochargers businesses, which represent about a quarter of our portfolio, posted double-digit revenue growth. These results demonstrate that our management teams and employees around the globe are focused on creating a stronger, more growth-focused Honeywell." Net income was $344 million for the quarter. Free cash flow of $539 million was positively impacted by inventory reductions, lower capital expenditures relative to depreciation expense and favorable cash tax payments. Total debt minus cash and cash equivalents resulted in net debt of $2.3 billion, or 19% of net capital, versus 22% at the end of the second quarter. Net capital is defined as shareowners' equity plus net debt. -MORE-
2-results "We continue to demonstrate technological leadership across the portfolio," Mr. Cote said. "Our Aerospace business was selected to develop integrated software for the U.S. Army's Future Combat System program, and received its first Federal Aviation Administration approval for the Primus Epic[SYMBOL] integrated cockpit. In Automation and Control Solutions (ACS), Experion PKS'TM' process control system was recognized by START magazine and Microsoft with a Vision Award for innovation. Our Turbocharger business delivered another quarter of impressive growth in all geographic regions and successfully completed development of its third-generation Variable Nozzle Turbocharger. "We also continued steady progress on rationalizing the Specialty Materials portfolio by completing the sale of two non-core businesses." * * * * * Third-Quarter Segment Highlights Aerospace o Revenues were up 1.1% compared with the third quarter of 2002, as a result of strong sales in Defense & Space, which offset declines in Commercial Aerospace. o Segment margins were 13.6%, down from 15.3% a year ago, due primarily to higher pension costs and commercial aftermarket sales mix. o The company was selected by Boeing Co. and Science Applications International Corp. to develop integrated software for the U.S. Army's Future Combat System program. Estimated value of the contracts could be more than $200 million during the program development phase. o Aerospace's Primus Epic[SYMBOL] integrated avionics system received its first Federal Aviation Administration approval for Gulfstream's G550 ultra-long-range business jet. Automation and Control Solutions o Revenues were up 8.6% compared with the third quarter of 2002, due to acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation. o Segment margins were 10.9%, compared with 13.5% in the third quarter of 2002, driven by pricing, higher pension costs, Building Solutions' sales mix and increased research and development and other expenses. o ACS' Process Solutions business received a 2003 Technology & Business Award from START Magazine and Microsoft for Experion PKS[SYMBOL], the company's process control system. o The Honeywell Round[SYMBOL] thermostat celebrated its 50th anniversary during the third quarter. The Round[SYMBOL], part of a Smithsonian Institution collection of pioneering designs, has sold 85 million units since 1953. -MORE-
3-results Specialty Materials o Revenues were down 2.5%, compared with the third quarter of 2002, due to the disposition of Advanced Circuits and Metglas, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation. o Segment margins were (1.0%), compared with 1.3% in the prior year, due to higher pension costs, plant disruptions and raw materials, partially offset by divestitures and cost actions. o Specialty Materials completed the sale of its Metglas business to Hitachi Metals, Ltd and its European textile operations to Glaeser Textile. Transportation Systems o Revenues increased 8.2%, compared with the third quarter of 2002, driven by continued strong growth in turbochargers and favorable foreign currency translation. o Turbocharger sales were up 16% and continued to be strong in all regions as Europe increased 17%, Americas 12% and Asia 7%. o Segment margins were 10.3%, compared with 11.2% a year ago, primarily reflecting higher pension costs and lower volume and unfavorable mix in Friction Materials, partially offset by margin expansion in Turbochargers. o Our Turbocharger business successfully completed development of its third-generation Variable Nozzle Turbocharger to maintain its leadership in the diesel car segment. Also, the Shanghai manufacturing facility produced its one-millionth turbocharger during the quarter. Honeywell will discuss its results during its investor webcast at 8:30 am ET today. The webcast and related presentation materials will be available at www.honeywell.com/investor. * * * * * Honeywell is a $22 billion diversified technology and manufacturing leader, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes and industry; turbochargers; automotive products; specialty chemicals; fibers; and electronic and advanced materials.

9-results Honeywell International Inc. Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment. We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
