ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. The previously announced letter of intent regarding a transaction in which Federal-Mogul Corp. would acquire Honeywell's automotive Bendix friction materials business, and Honeywell would receive a permanent channeling injunction shielding it from all current and future Bendix-related personal injury asbestos liabilities, expired on November 15, 2003. The parties remain engaged in active negotiations regarding a possible transaction. No assurances can be given, however, as to the completion or terms of any transaction. Whether or not the transaction is completed, we do not believe that the Bendix-related asbestos claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our potential exposure, our prior experience in resolving these claims, and our insurance coverage and existing reserves. 2
