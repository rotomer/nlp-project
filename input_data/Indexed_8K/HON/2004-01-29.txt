Exhibit 99 [HONEYWELL LETTERHEAD] NEWS RELEASE Contact: Media Investors Victoria Streitfeld Dan Gallagher 973-455-5281 973-455-2222 victoria.streitfeld@honeywell.com dan.gallagher@honeywell.com HONEYWELL'S 2003 EARNINGS $1.3 BILLION; CASH FROM OPERATIONS $2.2 BILLION; FOURTH-QUARTER REVENUE UP 5.7% o Full-year earnings per share of $1.54 o 2003 revenues of $23.1 billion o Full-year free cash flow of $1.5 billion, including $670 million pension contribution o Fourth-quarter revenues increase in all four operating segments MORRIS TOWNSHIP, NJ, January 29, 2004 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced full-year earnings per share of $1.54, in line with prior earnings guidance. The results are $1.81 above the same period last year, due to 2002 net charges of $2.27 partially offset by higher 2003 pension expense. Revenues of $23.1 billion were up 3.7% from the previous year, driven primarily by favorable foreign currency translation. Full-year cash flow from operations reached $2.2 billion, including a contribution of $670 million to the company's pension fund, and full-year free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) reached $1.5 billion. "2003 was a year of significant progress," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Dave Cote. "Revenue grew nearly 4% despite difficult market conditions and we reported earnings of $1.3 billion, in line with our previous guidance. Free cash flow of $1.5 billion was very strong and included $670 million of contributions to the pension plan, which significantly mitigates future funding requirements. The balance sheet strengthened, and we finished the year with $3 billion of cash on hand. We continued our focus on productivity and also made improvements in cycle time, quality and delivery. We improved our acquisition process and continued to make progress on the portfolio. Most importantly, we made progress on our growth initiatives with significant investments in new products and services that will benefit us in 2004 and beyond." Fourth-quarter earnings per share were 47 cents, in line with prior earnings guidance. The results are $2.25 above the same period last year, due to 2002 net charges of $2.28 partially offset by higher 2003 pension expense. Fourth quarter results include an after-tax increase of $129 million in reserves for environmental and litigation matters, substantially offset by a one-time tax -MORE-
2-2003 results benefit of $108 million associated with the termination of plans to sell the company's Friction Materials business. Revenues of $6.2 billion were up 5.7% from the previous year, driven primarily by favorable foreign currency translation and organic growth in the Transportation and Specialty Materials segments. Cash flow from operations was $503 million, including a contribution of $500 million in the quarter to the company's pension fund, and free cash flow reached $255 million. "We see positive momentum in each of our four business segments as we begin 2004," Mr. Cote said. "In the fourth quarter, we saw double-digit growth in Turbochargers and core businesses in Specialty Materials. In our Commercial Aerospace business we saw signs of recovery as global flying hours showed the greatest year-over-year quarterly improvement since 2001. The downturn in Commercial Construction has slowed and our Fire and Security businesses continue to perform well. We are also encouraged by early indications of economic recovery and are expecting year-over-year growth in revenues and margins in each business segment." * * * * * Fourth-Quarter Segment Highlights Aerospace o Revenues were up 0.1%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002, as a result of higher sales in Defense and Space offset by weakness in Commercial Aerospace. o Segment margins reached 15.9%, compared with 14.3% a year ago, due to higher productivity net of inflation and other expenses. o The Primus Epic'r' cockpit was certified for Dassault's Falcon 900EX EASy business jet. o The HTF7000 engine entered service on Bombardier's Super-Midsize Challenger 300 Business Jet. o Engines, Systems & Services won a $400 million contract to supply its RE220 APU to Sukoi Civil Aircraft for use on its RRJ regional aircraft. Automation and Control Solutions o Revenues were up 8.0%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002, as a result of acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation. o Segment margins were 12.3%, compared with 12.0% in the fourth quarter of 2002, with productivity gains offsetting increased investment. o Honeywell's "Instant Alert'TM' for Schools," a new automated emergency notification and communication system for parents and guardians, was introduced. o The company continues to grow its position in Commercial Security and Home Networking by acquiring Silent Witness and the assets of FutureSmart Systems. o Asset Locator'TM', the company's new real-time tracking and monitoring service, was used for the first time for school bus tracking; and has continued to be installed as a hospital infant security system. o Process Solutions' orders increased 24% over the same period last year driven by Experion PKS'TM' wins. -MORE-
3-2003 results Specialty Materials o Revenues were up 1.5%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002, with 8.2% organic growth partially offset by the disposition of non-core assets. o Segment margins were 4.7%, compared with 1.7% in 2002, with higher volume, price increases and synergies from the nylon transaction offsetting higher raw material costs. o The Spectra'r' business saw strong demand from the U.S. military for small arms protective insert plates. o Increasing demand for HFCs, a key component of many non-ozone depleting refrigerants and foam blowing agents, resulted in a 26% increase in Fluorocarbon revenue, versus the prior year. Transportation Systems o Revenues increased 19.8%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002, driven by unit volume and favorable foreign currency translation. o Segment margins were 13.2%, compared with 11.5% a year ago, driven by unit volume. o The Turbocharger business grew 34% primarily due to increased European diesel penetration and higher AVNT sales for commercial vehicles. o Consumer Products Group introduced FRAM AirHog, a high performance air filter that expanded its leading brand into a new market segment.

Total pretax charges were $214 million (after-tax $19 million, or $0.02 per share). The after-tax charge includes a tax benefit associated with the redesignation of our Friction Materials business from held for sale to held and used. (B) Represents adjustments to sales of non-strategic businesses in the third quarter of 2003 (after-tax loss $2 million, with no effect on earnings per share). (C) Cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and other (income) expense include provisions of $388, $41 and $15 million, respectively, for net repositioning and other charges. Including the asbestos litigation and business impairment charges, total net pretax charges were $2,826 million (after-tax $1,897 million, or $2.30 per share). (D) Represents the pretax loss on the sale of our Advanced Circuits business (after-tax gain $18 million, or $0.02 per share).

(E) Dilutive securities issuable in connection with stock plans have been excluded from the calculation of loss per share because their effect would reduce the loss per share.
Honeywell International Inc. Consolidated Statement of Operations (Unaudited) (In millions except per share amounts) (A) Cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and equity in (income) loss of affiliated companies include provisions of $272, $4 and $2 million, respectively, for legacy environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable in 2003 and net repositioning and other charges. Total net pretax charges were $278 million (after-tax $41 million, or $0.05 per share). The after-tax charge includes tax benefits from the redesignation of our Friction Materials business from held for sale to held and used and a tax settlement related to a prior year asset impairment.

(D) Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143). SFAS No. 143 requires recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. This adoption resulted in an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment of expense of $20 million, or $0.02 per share. (E) Cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, equity in (income) loss of affiliated companies and other (income) expense include provisions of $561, $45, $13 and $15 million, respectively, for net repositioning and other charges.

(F) Represents the net pretax loss on the dispositions of our Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems, Pharmaceutical Fine Chemicals, Automation and Control's Consumer Products and Advanced Circuits businesses (after-tax gain $195 million, or $0.24 per share). The after-tax gain is due to the higher deductible tax basis than book basis in the shares sold for the Fine Chemicals, Consumer Products and Advanced Circuits businesses. (G) Dilutive securities issuable in connection with stock plans have been excluded from the calculation of loss per share because their effect would reduce the loss per share.
Honeywell International Inc. Segment Data (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions) (A) Amounts included in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. Honeywell's Senior Management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment profit is business unit income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expenses, gains (losses) on sales of non-strategic businesses, equity income (loss), other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense) income, and repositioning, environmental, litigation, business impairment and other charges and the cumulative effect of accounting changes. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Honeywell changed the definition of segment profit to exclude pension and other postretirement benefits (expense) income. Pension and other postretirement benefits (expense) income is significantly impacted by external factors such as investment returns, interest rates and other actuarial factors that Honeywell does not consider indicative of the underlying business segment operating performance under the control of business unit management. All periods presented have been restated to reflect this change.
Honeywell International Inc. Consolidated Balance Sheet (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions) Certain prior year amounts, principally related to deferred income taxes and prepaid pension benefit cost, have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Honeywell International Inc. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions)
Honeywell International Inc. Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment. We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
