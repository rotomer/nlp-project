Sales of $6.4 billion were up 11% compared to 2003, primarily due to strong volume growth in all four operating segments. Cash flow from operations was $505 million and free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) was $357 million. "In the second quarter, all four Honeywell businesses saw increases in sales and improving end markets," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. "Double digit net income growth was driven by strong conversion on higher volume. We are benefiting from the depth and breadth of our technology, our strong customer relationships and the actions taken to prepare for the market turnaround we are now experiencing. We continue to fund growth initiatives that will translate into future opportunities across our businesses." Net income increased to $361 million for the quarter, with volume driven profitability partially offset by the impact of higher non-cash pension expense. Free cash flow of $357 million equals approximately 100% of net income. Net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) was $1.9 billion, or 15% of net capital (shareowners' equity plus net debt). -MORE-
2-results "Order rates continue to be strong in all of our businesses," Mr. Cote said. "The Aerospace business was awarded its third major contract on Boeing's 7E7 Dreamliner. With the addition of the Flight Control Electronics contract, the estimated total program value is now in excess of $2.5 billion. Automation and Control Solutions introduced a new touch screen programmable thermostat and won significant new contracts in its Building and Process Solutions businesses. Transportation System's Garrett'r' turbo technology was introduced on the new diesel Mercedes Benz E320 in the United States with very positive reviews. In Specialty Materials, our Spectra'r' bullet-resistant fiber and our broad fluorines product offerings continue to experience double digit orders growth." During the quarter the company continued to make progress divesting non-core businesses and improving its cost base. Divestitures (principally Security Monitoring) resulted in gains of $233 million. Additionally, the company recorded a $40 million impairment charge relating to the planned disposition of its Polyester business and a $170 million charge in connection with environmental and other litigation matters. Productivity projects resulted in a $32 million charge for repositioning and other actions. * * * * * Second-Quarter Segment Highlights Aerospace o Sales were up 14%, compared with the second quarter of 2003, led by 20% growth in Commercial sales.

(F) Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143). SFAS No. 143 requires recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. This adoption resulted in an after-tax cumulative effect expense adjustment of $20 million, or $0.02 per share. We report our quarterly financial information using a calendar convention; that is, the first, second and third quarters are consistently reported as ending on March 31, June 30 and September 30, respectively. It has been our practice to establish actual quarterly closing dates using a predetermined "fiscal" calendar, which requires our businesses to close their books on a Saturday in order to minimize the potentially disruptive effects of quarterly closing on business processes. The effects of this practice are generally not significant to reported results for any quarter and only exist within a reporting year. In the event that differences in actual closing dates are material to year-over-year comparisons of quarterly or year-to-date results, we will provide appropriate disclosures. Our actual closing dates for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 were July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, respectively. Our fiscal closing calendar for the years 2000 through 2012 is available on our website at www.honeywell.com under the heading "Investor Relations". -MORE-

10-results Honeywell International Inc. Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment. We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
