Sales of $6.4 billion were up 11% compared to 2003, resulting from organic sales growth in all four operating segments. Cash flow from operations was $645 million and free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) was $525 million. "These results reflect another quarter of strong sales and earnings, due to solid operational execution and continued business improvement," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. "Each of our operating segments experienced increased orders and organic sales growth. Segment profit increased 20% due to good volume conversion, offset by higher raw material costs in the non-core businesses of Specialty Materials. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and drive free cash flow while at the same time investing in productivity and growth initiatives across the company." Net income increased to $372 million for the quarter, including the impact of $105 million of pre-tax pension expense. Free cash flow of $525 million equals 141% of net income. Also, subsequent to quarter end, Standard and Poor's Ratings Services affirmed its `A/A-1' corporate credit rating on Honeywell and revised its outlook to stable from negative. -MORE-
2-results "Growth initiatives in each operating segment are gaining momentum and driving new business," Mr. Cote said. "During the quarter, Aerospace's Primus Epic'r' integrated cockpit system was certified on the Gulfstream G450. Automation and Control Solutions introduced FocusPRO 5000, a digital thermostat, and experienced double-digit orders growth in both its Building and Process Solutions businesses. Transportation Systems continued to advance turbo technology, and introduced next generation VNT'TM' on the new BMW 1 Series platform at the Paris Motor Show. In Specialty Materials, the Chemicals business continued to expand its Asian presence by breaking ground on a new refrigerant manufacturing facility in China." During the quarter, the company initiated repositioning actions resulting in a charge of $37 million. Additionally, the company recorded a $64 million charge in connection with environmental and other litigation matters, which was partially offset by $32 million in gains from legal settlements and previously divested businesses. * * * * * Third-Quarter Segment Highlights Aerospace o Sales increased 11% over the third quarter of 2003, led by 17% growth in Commercial sales. Defense & Space sales grew 3% in the quarter. o Segment margin increased to 15.4%, compared with 14.6% a year ago, due primarily to strong commercial aftermarket sales growth, which was driven by increased global flying hours. o Primus Epic'r' integrated avionics suite was certified on the Gulfstream G450, the third Gulfstream certification for Primus Epic'r' and the eighth Primus Epic'r' certification overall. o Aircraft Landing Systems was awarded a $60 million contract with Lufthansa to provide wheel and brake products for its fleet of 30 747-400 aircraft. o Honeywell was selected by Lockheed Martin as Supply Services Provider for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

(G) Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143). SFAS No. 143 requires recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. This adoption resulted in an after-tax cumulative effect expense adjustment of $20 million, or $0.02 per share. We report our quarterly financial information using a calendar convention; that is, the first, second and third quarters are consistently reported as ending on March 31, June 30 and September 30, respectively. It has been our practice to establish actual quarterly closing dates using a predetermined "fiscal" calendar, which requires our businesses to close their books on a Saturday in order to minimize the potentially disruptive effects of quarterly closing on business processes. The effects of this practice are generally not significant to reported results for any quarter and only exist within a reporting year. In the event that differences in actual closing dates are material to year-over-year comparisons of quarterly or year-to-date results, we will provide appropriate disclosures. Our actual closing dates for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 were October 2, 2004 and September 27, 2003, respectively. Our fiscal closing calendar for the years 2000 through 2012 is available on our website at www.honeywell.com under the heading "Investor Relations". -MORE-

9-results Honeywell International Inc. Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment. We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
