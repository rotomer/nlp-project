ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On January 7, 2005, Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell) announced that Robert J. Gillette has been appointed President and CEO of Honeywell Aerospace, effective immediately. Honeywell also announced that Robert D. Johnson plans to retire in January of 2006, and will serve as the Non-executive Chairman of Honeywell Aerospace during 2005 to facilitate an orderly leadership succession.
Mr. Johnson's annual incentive compensation target for work performed in 2005 has been reduced from one-hundred percent (100%) to fifty percent (50%) of his base salary in light of the changed nature of his role.
Under Honeywell's Growth Plan (a long-term, cash-based compensation program), fifty percent (50%) of earned awards for the two-year performance period January 1, 2003  December 31, 2004 will be paid to participants in the first quarter of 2005, with the remaining fifty percent (50%) to be paid one year later, provided that participants are employed by Honeywell on the payment date.  In recognition of his willingness to facilitate an orderly leadership succession, Mr. Johnson will be entitled to receive the cash award payable in the first quarter of 2006.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
