Sales of $25.6 billion were up 11% compared to 2003, resulting from organic growth in all four operating segments. Full-year cash flow from operations was $2.3 billion and free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) was $1.6 billion. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.49 per share, in line with prior guidance and up 4% versus 2003. Sales of $6.6 billion were up 7% from 2003, including the impact of fewer reporting days in the fourth quarter versus prior year. Free cash flow was $540 million. "In 2004, Honeywell experienced strong organic growth in each of its operating segments, exceeded its sales, earnings and cash targets, and executed on key acquisitions and divestitures," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. "We announced a 10% increase in our dividend, our first increase in five years, and moved to bolster our Automation and Control Solutions business with our announced offer to acquire the shares of Novar plc. Overall, 2004 was a year of significant progress across the company." "In the fourth quarter, we continued to experience improvements in our end markets and results from our investments in growth initiatives," continued Cote. "Aerospace won new contracts on Boeing's 7E7 Dreamliner, continued to grow its strong defense business and benefited from another quarter of increased global flying hours. Automation and Control Solutions continued to experience orders growth in both Building and Process Solutions, with key installation, energy retrofit and overseas contract wins.

Specialty Materials continued to grow its core portfolio and completed the divestiture of its non-core Performance Fibers business." Honeywell increased its 2005 EPS range to $1.95-$2.05, in light of strong order rates, as well as lower than anticipated 2005 non-cash pension expense. Honeywell will review its results during its investor webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET today.

9-results Honeywell International Inc. Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment. We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
