ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On February 18, 2005, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals denied Honeywell's appeal of a May 2003 decision by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in the matter entitled Interfaith Community Organization et al. v. Honeywell International, Inc., et al., ordering Honeywell to conduct the excavation and transport for offsite disposal of approximately one million tons of chromium residue present at a predecessor Honeywell site located in Jersey City, New Jersey. As disclosed in prior SEC filings, Honeywell believed that the District Court-ordered remedy would be remanded, reversed or replaced and, accordingly, provisions previously made in Honeywell's financial statements for remedial costs at this site did not assume excavation and offsite removal of chromium. In light of the Appeals Court decision, Honeywell will record a before tax charge of $278 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, which reflects the incremental cost of implementing the remedy. The charge will reduce Honeywell's reported 2004 earnings per share from the previously announced $1.68 per share to $1.49 per share. Implementation of the excavation and offsite removal remedy is expected to take place over a five-year period, and the cost of implementation is expected to be incurred evenly over that period. Honeywell does not expect implementation of the remedy to have a material adverse effect on its future consolidated results of operations, operating cash flows or consolidated financial position. ITEM 8.01. Other Events On February 18, 2005, Honeywell International Inc. issued a press release announcing the appeal decision. A copy of the press release is attached on this Report as an exhibit.

[HONEYWELL LETTERHEAD] NEWS RELEASE Contacts: Media Investor Relations Robert C. Ferris Nicholas Noviello 973-455-3388 973-455-2222 rob.ferris@honeywell.com nicholas.noviello@honeywell.com HONEYWELL'S RESPONSE TO UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT DECISION: INTERFAITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION v. HONEYWELL MORRIS TOWNSHIP, NJ, February 18, 2005 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today issued the following statement in response to the denial by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit of Honeywell's appeal in the matter: Interfaith Community Organization et al. v. Honeywell International, Inc. et al. "In May 2003, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ordered the excavation of approximately one million tons of chromium residue at a predecessor company site in Jersey City, New Jersey. "The company appealed the court's decision because it believes that capping the site is a better long-term environmental solution that will allow for productive redevelopment sooner than the court-ordered excavation. "While Honeywell disagrees with today's decision, the company will take a before tax charge of $278 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, reflecting the anticipated incremental costs associated with implementing the district court's order. Estimated complete implementation of the excavation remedy will take about five years. The charge will reduce the company's reported 2004 earnings per share from the previously announced $1.68 per share to $1.49 per share. "The company is maintaining its previously announced guidance for 2005 EPS of $1.95 - $2.05 and cash flow from operations of $2.4 - $2.5 billion (free cash flow of $1.6 - $1.7 billion). Given the expected five-year implementation, the incremental cash costs of the remedy will not significantly affect previous guidance regarding total future cash commitments for pension, environmental, asbestos, and repositioning expenditures." # # #
