Honeywell Acquisitions Limited (Honeywell Acquisitions), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell), has received final clearance from the European Commission to acquire the entire ordinary and preference share capital of Novar plc (Novar) and has declared its offers for such shares wholly unconditional.
 
As of 3:00 p.m. (London time) on March 30, 2005, Honeywell Acquisitions had received valid acceptances of the Offers with respect to approximately 87.01% of Novar's issued ordinary share capital and approximately 95.42% of Novar's issued preference share capital.
 
Honeywell Acquisitions intends to exercise its right under Sections 428 to 430F of the Companies Act 1985 to acquire compulsorily all of the remaining outstanding Novar preference shares and, as soon as practicable after receiving valid acceptances (pursuant to the offers, which presently remain open) in respect of at least 90% of the Novar ordinary shares, all of the remaining outstanding Novar ordinary shares.
 
No offer to acquire any securities of Novar is being, or will be, made in the United States or to U.S. persons. Securities may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons absent registration or an exemption from registration. Neither Honeywell nor Honeywell Acquisitions intends to register or offer securities in the United States or to U.S. persons in connection with Honeywell Acquisitions' offers to acquire the entire ordinary and preference share capital of Novar.
