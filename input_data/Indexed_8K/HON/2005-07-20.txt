HONEYWELL SECOND QUARTER SALES UP 10% TO $7.0 BILLION; EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 29% BEFORE TAX CHARGE TO REPATRIATE $2.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS
 
Raises Forecast 10 Cents From Prior Guidance, Excluding Tax Charge For Repatriation
 
MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., July 20, 2005 -- Honeywell (
NYSE: HON
) today announced a 10% increase in second quarter sales to $7.0 billion compared to $6.4 billion in 2004, primarily due to organic sales growth in each of its four businesses. The company reported earnings of 36 cents per share, including a tax charge of 18 cents per share for the repatriation of $2.7 billion of foreign earnings related to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Excluding this tax charge, earnings increased 29% to 54 cents per share (including 3 cents per share from discontinued operations) versus 42 cents per share in the second quarter of 2004. Net income was $306 million for the quarter ($461 million before the aforementioned tax charge) versus $361 million last year. Cash flow from operations was $569 million and free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) was $410 million.
"Second quarter performance was excellent, driven by organic sales growth and operational execution in each of our businesses," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. "We are confident that this performance will continue for the remainder of the year and are increasing guidance accordingly."
The company increased its previously announced 2005 sales guidance by $400 million to $27.8  $28.0 billion and earnings per share guidance (excluding the abovementioned tax charge) 10 cents to $2.05  $2.15 ($1.87 - $1.97 per share on a reported basis). Free cash flow guidance was increased $100 million to $1.7  $1.8 billion (cash flow from operations of $2.5 - $2.6 billion).
Cote concluded, "Each of our businesses demonstrated strong first half performance. Orders are up, pricing and productivity actions are offsetting higher commodity and raw materials costs, we introduced great new products and won important new contracts. We are repatriating $2.7 billion of foreign earnings to enhance the flexibility of our already strong balance sheet."

We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment.
We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
