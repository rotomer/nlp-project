HONEYWELL ANNOUNCES CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR AEROSPACE CUSTOMER INCENTIVES
 
No Impact on Company's Previously Announced 2006 Guidance
 
MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- February 16, 2006 -- Honeywell (
NYSE: HON
) announced today that it is changing its accounting policy for incentives provided to customers of its Aerospace segment, beginning in 2006. While the existing policy is considered acceptable, the company believes that the new policy is preferable and will improve decision-making and controls for customer incentives.
Like other suppliers to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines, the company provides incentives principally in the form of free or deeply discounted products in order to secure the selection of its equipment for installation on commercial aircraft. Historically, the company in certain circumstances has capitalized the costs of these customer incentives and amortized them as a charge to earnings over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft being serviced. While management of the company and its independent auditors believe that this existing accounting treatment is acceptable under generally accepted accounting principles, it has decided to change its method of accounting in the first quarter of 2006 to recognize the cost of these incentives as incurred.
As a result of this change, current accounting standards require the company to apply the new policy retrospectively to certain previously issued financial statements as if it had been in force during those historical periods. Had this new accounting policy been in effect, it would have reduced net income previously reported (or to be reported) for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 by approximately $20 million (1.0%), $35 million (2.7%) and $35 million (2.6%), respectively, or $0.02 per share in 2005, $0.04 per share in 2004 and $0.04 per share in 2003. Additionally, application of the new policy would have

reduced shareowners' equity as of the beginning of 2003 by approximately $400 million (4.5%). There is no impact on previously reported cash flows.
The change to the preferable method of accounting will have no impact on the company's financial guidance for the full year or first quarter 2006.  Full year guidance remains at sales of approximately $30 billion, earnings of $2.40-$2.50 per share and cash flow from operations of $2.9-$3.1 billion (free cash flow of $2.1-$2.3 billion).  First quarter 2006 guidance remains at sales of $7.1-$7.2 billion and earnings of $0.47-$0.49 per share.  In addition, there will be no impact on 2006 guidance for Aerospace segment sales, segment profit or margins.  Guidance for Aerospace remains at sales of approximately $11.1 billion, segment profit of $1.9-$2.0 billion and margins of 17.5-18%.
