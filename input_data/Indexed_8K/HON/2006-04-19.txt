HONEYWELL REPORTS FIRST QUARTER SALES UP 12% TO $7.2 BILLION; EARNINGS UP 24% TO 52 CENTS PER SHARE
 
More Than a Full Point of Margin Expansion in the Quarter
 
MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., April 19, 2006 -- Honeywell (
NYSE: HON
) today announced first-quarter 2006 sales of $7.2 billion, up 12% over the prior year. Earnings per share were $0.52, a 24% increase versus 2005. Cash flow from operations was $239 million and free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) was $117 million.
 
"Honeywell is off to a terrific start in what we expect to be another great year," said Honeywell Chairman and CEO Dave Cote. "The quarter's highlights include strong organic growth, margin expansion and better than expected earnings. Our first-quarter performance builds on the company's growing track record of strong operational execution and financial results. Honeywell's businesses are well positioned in attractive industries, and we remain confident in our outlook for 25 to 30 percent earnings growth in 2006."
 
"We also completed the acquisition of First Technology plc at the end of the quarter and expect to complete the divestiture of the non-core First Technology Safety & Analysis business in the second quarter," continued Cote. "Together with last year's acquisition of Zellweger Analytics, First Technology positions our Automation and Control Solutions business as a global leader in gas sensing and detection technologies."

We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment.
We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
