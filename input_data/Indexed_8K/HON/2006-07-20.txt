News Release
          MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., July 20, 2006 -- Honeywell () today announced second-quarter 2006 sales of $7.9 billion, up 12% over the prior year, and earnings per share of $0.63 versus $0.36 last year. Earnings per share growth was 27%, after taking into account a tax charge for cash repatriation ($0.18) and income from discontinued operations ($0.03) in the second-quarter of 2005, and stock options expense ($0.02) in 2006. Cash flow from operations was $935 million and free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) was $786 million versus $410 million in the second quarter of 2005.

          "We feel very good about the first half of 2006 and are confident about the remainder of the year," said Honeywell Chairman and CEO Dave Cote. "Our strong second-quarter results were driven by favorable organic growth, margin expansion and a significant increase in free cash flow. As part of our disciplined cash deployment philosophy, we repurchased 12 million shares of stock in the second quarter and have repurchased 20 million shares since the beginning of this year."
          "As a result of this strong performance and our confidence in the second half of 2006, we have raised our full-year earnings guidance to $2.48 - $2.53 per share from the previous $2.40 - $2.50 per share," continued Cote.
          "We believe that end market conditions will remain favorable and macro trends will support our long-term business growth," concluded Cote. "Honeywell's breadth of technologies, products and services, combined with great positions in good industries, will continue to drive our performance."

We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment.
We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
