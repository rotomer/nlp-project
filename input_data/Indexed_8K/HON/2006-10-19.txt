News Release
 
HONEYWELL THIRD QUARTER SALES UP 15% TO $8.0 BILLION;
EARNINGS UP 22% TO 66 CENTS PER SHARE
2006 EPS Guidance Moves to High End of Range
MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., October 19, 2006  Honeywell (
NYSE: HON
) today announced that third quarter 2006 sales increased 15% to $8.0 billion, driven by 9% organic sales growth. Earnings were $0.66 per share versus $0.54 last year, an increase of 22%. Earnings per share growth was 36%, after taking into account income from discontinued operations ($0.04) in the third quarter of 2005, and stock options expense ($0.02) in 2006. Cash flow from operations was $796 million versus $705 million last year, and free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) was $634 million versus $543 million in the third quarter of 2005.
"We are pleased with our double-digit sales and earnings growth in the third quarter," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. "These results demonstrate the progress Honeywell has made in building a global multi-industry portfolio that continues to perform in dynamic business conditions. We are confident in our ability to deliver 13% sales growth, more than a 30% increase in earnings, and 25% growth in free cash flow this year."
Honeywell re-affirmed its previously stated 2006 sales guidance of more than $31 billion. The company now expects earnings per share of $2.51 - 2.53, the high end of its previously stated range, and free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion (cash flow from operations of approximately $3.0 billion).
"While we anticipate slightly lower global economic growth next year, overall macro-trends remain favorable to our multi-industry portfolio," concluded Cote. "In 2007, we expect continued healthy organic sales growth, a double-digit increase in earnings, and strong free cash flow. We will continue to deploy cash effectively to grow our businesses and to return value to shareowners through share repurchases and dividends."

Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (Unaudited)
(Dollars in millions)
 
We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment.
We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
