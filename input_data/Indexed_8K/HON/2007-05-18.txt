On May 14, 2007, Honeywell entered into a $2.8 billion Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (the "
Credit Agreement
") with the banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders party to the Credit Agreement (the "
Lenders
"), Citicorp USA, Inc., as administrative agent for the Lenders, Citibank International PLC, as swing line agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and UBS Loan Finance LLC, as documentation agents, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as joint lead arrangers and co-book managers. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $3.5 billion.
The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the previously reported $2.3 billion five year credit agreement dated as of April 27, 2006 (the "
Prior Agreement
"). No borrowings were outstanding at any time under the Prior Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes a $700 million sub-limit for the potential issuance of letters of credit. Approximately $109 million of letters of credit under the Prior Agreement are deemed to have been issued under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement has substantially the same material terms and conditions as the Prior Agreement. Loans under the Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than May 14, 2012, unless such date is extended pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement does not restrict Honeywell's ability to pay dividends, nor does it contain financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the Credit Agreement would prevent any further borrowings and would generally require the repayments of any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Such events of default include, among other things, (a) non-payment of Credit Agreement debt, interest or fees; (b) non-compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement covenants; (c) cross-default with other debt in certain circumstances; (d) bankruptcy; and (e) defaults upon obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Additionally, each of the banks has the right to terminate its commitment to lend additional funds or issue additional letters of credit under the Credit Agreement if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of Honeywell's voting stock, or, during any 12-month period, individuals who were directors of Honeywell at the beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors.
Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreement would be determined, at Honeywell's option, by (a) an auction bidding procedure; (b) the highest of the floating base rate publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., 0.5 percent above the average CD rate, or 0.5 percent above the Federal funds rate; or (c) the average Eurocurrency rate plus 0.15 percent (applicable margin).
Honeywell has agreed to pay a facility fee of .05 percent per annum on the aggregate commitment for the Credit Agreement. The facility fee, the applicable margin over the Eurocurrency rate on the Credit Agreement, and the letter of credit issuance fee, are subject to change, based upon a grid determined by Honeywell's long-term debt ratings. The Credit Agreement is not subject to termination based upon a decrease in Honeywell's debt ratings or a Material Adverse Change (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
The description of the Credit Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing when such Revolving Credit Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. The Borrower requesting a Swing Line Borrowing shall indemnify each Swing Line Bank against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Swing Line Bank as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Swing Line Borrowing for such Swing Line Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Swing Line Bank to fund the Swing Line Advance to be made by such Swing Line Bank as part of such Swing Line Borrowing when such Swing Line Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.
     
(e) (i) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower proposing such Revolving Credit Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (x) in the case of such Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (y) in the case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in any Major Currency.

If and to the extent that such Swing Line Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Swing Line Agent such Swing Line Bank and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Swing Line Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Swing Line Agent at (x) in the case of such Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to Swing Line Advances comprising such Swing Line Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Swing Line Agent in respect of such amount, and (y) in the case of such Swing Line Bank, the cost

(f) (i) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing.

Each such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "Notice of Issuance") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or facsimile, specifying therein the requested (A) date of such issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (B) Available Amount and currency (which shall be a Major Currency or Dollars) of such Letter of Credit, (C) expiration date of such Letter of Credit (which shall not be later than the Termination Date), (D) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (E) form of such Letter of Credit, and shall be accompanied by such customary application and agreement for letter of credit as such Issuing Bank may specify to the Borrower requesting such issuance for use in connection with such requested Letter of Credit (a "

In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender's Ratable Share of each drawing made under a Letter of Credit funded by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date made, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to any Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such Lender's Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit at each time such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment is amended pursuant to the operation of Sections 2.06(b), (c) or (d), an assignment in accordance with Section 9.06 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement.
                         
(c)
Drawing and Reimbursement

Each Issuing Bank shall give prompt notice (and such Issuing Bank will use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such notice within one Business Day) of each drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it to the Company, the applicable Borrower (if not the Company) and the Agent. Upon written demand by such Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the Agent and the Company, each Lender shall pay to the Agent such Lender's Ratable Share of such outstanding Revolving Credit Advance, by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Credit Advance to be funded by such Lender,
provided
that the Lenders shall not be required to fund such Revolving Credit Advances resulting from drawings under a Letter of Credit denominated in any Major Currency until such Advance is exchanged for the Equivalent in Dollars and is a Base Rate Advance. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make Revolving Credit Advances pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving
Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent shall transfer such funds to such Issuing Bank. Each Lender agrees to fund its Ratable Share of an outstanding Revolving Credit Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by such Issuing Bank,
provided
that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Revolving Credit Advance available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by any such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account of such Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the Agent such amount for the account of any such Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Revolving Credit Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day. "
Overnight Eurocurrency Rate
" means the rate per annum applicable to an overnight period beginning on one Business Day and ending on the next Business Day equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Rate Advances and the rate per annum quoted by the Applicable Issuing Bank to the Agent as the rate at which it is offering overnight deposits in the relevant currency in amounts comparable to such Issuing Bank's Advances resulting from drawings on Letters of Credit denominated in a Major Currency.

A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to such Borrower and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
               
(b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority including, without limitation, any agency of the European Union or similar monetary or multinational authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of this type or the issuance of or participation in the Letters of Credit (or similar contingent obligations) hereunder, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
               
(c) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall, upon the written request of the Company delivered to such Lender and the Agent, assign, pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.06, all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the Notes to an Eligible Assignee selected by the Company;

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date
that such Lender notifies the Company of the change or circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further

SECTION 2.12.
Illegality
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or any Major Currency, LIBO Rate Advances in Dollars or in any Foreign Currency or Swing Line Advances in Euros or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or in any Major Currency, LIBO Rate Advances in Dollars or in any Foreign Currency or Swing Line Advances in Euros hereunder, (a) each such Eurocurrency Rate Advance, such LIBO Rate Advance or Swing Line Advance, as the case may be, will automatically, upon such demand, (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.08(a)(i), as the case may be, and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance, LIBO Rate Advance or Swing Line Advance is denominated in any Foreign Currency, be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.08(a)(i), as the case may be, and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make such Eurocurrency Rate Advances, such LIBO Rate Advances or such Swing Line Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
               
SECTION 2.13.

Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.18 or an extension of the Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.19, and upon the Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Increase Date or Extension Date, as the case may be, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the
interest assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.06(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
     
(c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, facility fee or Letter of Credit fee, as the case may be;
provided
,
however
, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
     
(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Foreign Currencies.
     
SECTION 2.14.

(a) Any and all payments by or on behalf of any Borrower (including the Company in its capacity as a guarantor under Article VII hereof) hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.13, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding
, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, net income taxes imposed by the United States or any State thereof and taxes imposed on its overall net
income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to as "
Taxes
"). If any Borrower (including the Company in its capacity as a guarantor under Article VII hereof) shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
     
(b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "
Other Taxes
").
     
(c) Each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.14) imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto;
provided
,
however
, that a Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any amounts in respect of penalties, interest or expenses pursuant to this paragraph that are payable solely as a result of (i) the failure on the part of the pertinent Lender or the Agent to pay over those amounts received from the Borrowers under this clause (c) or (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the pertinent Lender or the Agent. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. Each Lender agrees to provide reasonably prompt notice to the Agent, the Company and any Borrower of any imposition of Taxes or Other Taxes against such Lender;
provided
that failure to give such notice shall not affect such Lender's rights to indemnification hereunder. Each Lender agrees that it will, promptly upon a request by the Company or a Borrower having made an indemnification payment hereunder, furnish to the Company or such Borrower, as the case may be, such evidence as is reasonably available to such Lender as to the payment of the relevant Taxes or Other Taxes, and that it will, if requested by the Company or such Borrower, cooperate with the Company or such Borrower, as the case may be, in its efforts to obtain a refund or similar relief in respect of such payment.
     
(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes by a Borrower under subsection (a) above, each Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes by or on behalf of any Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of any Borrower by a payor that is not a
United States person, if such Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, such Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms "
United States
" and "
United States person
" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.
     
(e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender, on the date of the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender and on the date it changes its Applicable Lending Office in the case of any Lender, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by any Borrower (unless a change in law renders such Lender unable lawfully to do so), shall provide the Agent and each Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service forms W-8ECI or W-8BEN, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes. In addition, each Lender further agrees to provide any Borrower with any form or document as any Borrower may reasonably request which is required by any taxing authority outside the United States in order to secure an exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, withholding tax in such jurisdiction, if available to such Lender. If the forms provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement or changes its Applicable Lending Office indicate a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form;
provided
,
however
, that, in the case of a Lender that initially becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to an assignment in accordance with Section 9.06 or a Lender that undertakes a change in its Applicable Lending Office, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable on the date of such assignment or change with respect to the assignee Lender or Lender after the change in Applicable Lending Office, but only to the extent of United States withholding tax included in Taxes, if any, applicable on the date of such assignment or change with respect to the assignor Lender or Lender prior to such change in Applicable Lending Office. If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, that a Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, such Lender shall give notice thereof to each Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.
     
(f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide each Borrower with the appropriate form described in Section 2.14(e) (
other
than
if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.14(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure;
provided
,
however
, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, each Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.
     
(g) If any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or to the Agent or on behalf of any of them to any taxing authority pursuant to this Section 2.14, such Lender shall, upon the written request of the Company delivered to such Lender and the Agent, assign, pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.06, all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the Notes to an Eligible Assignee selected by the Company;
provided
,
however
, that (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such request and at the time of such assignment; (ii) the assignee shall have paid to the assigning Lender the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the date of such assignment on, the Note or Notes of such Lender; (iii) the Company shall have paid to the assigning Lender any and all facility fees and other fees payable to such Lender and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Lender under any provision of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any increased costs or other additional amounts owing under Section 2.11, any break funding costs under Section 9.04(c) and any indemnification for Taxes under this Section 2.14) as of the effective date of such assignment; and (iv) if the assignee selected by the Company is not an existing Lender, such assignee or the Company shall have paid the processing and recordation fee required under Section 9.06(a) for such assignment;
provided
further
that the assigning Lender's rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 8.05, shall survive such assignment as to matters occurring prior to the date of assignment.
     
SECTION 2.15.
Sharing of Payments, Etc
. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, if any, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Credit Advances or Swing Line Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.04(c), 2.06(b), 2.06(c), 2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(c)) in excess of its Ratable Share of payments on account of the Revolving Credit Advances or Swing Line Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Credit Advances or Swing Line Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided
,
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, if any) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
     
SECTION 2.16.
Use of Proceeds
. The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and each Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) for general corporate purposes of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, backstop of commercial paper.
     
SECTION 2.17.

time hereunder in respect of Revolving Credit Advances. Each Borrower agrees that upon request of any Lender to such Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) that such Lender receive a Revolving Credit Note to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Revolving Credit Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, such Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Revolving Credit Note payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount up to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender.
     
(b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.06(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from each Borrower hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.
     
(c) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement.
     
SECTION 2.18.
Increase in the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments
. (a) The Company may, at any time but in any event not more than once in any calendar year prior to the Termination Date, by notice to the Agent, request that the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments be increased by an amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a "

If the Lenders notify the Agent that they are willing to increase the amount of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested Commitment
Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be allocated among the Lenders willing to participate therein in such amounts as are agreed between the Company and the Agent.
     
(c) Promptly following each Commitment Date, the Agent shall notify the Company as to the amount, if any, by which the Lenders are willing to participate in the requested Commitment Increase. If the aggregate amount by which the Lenders are willing to participate in any requested Commitment Increase on any such Commitment Date is less than the requested Commitment Increase, then the Company may extend offers to one or more Eligible Assignees to participate in any portion of the requested Commitment Increase that has not been committed to by the Lenders as of the applicable Commitment Date;
provided

however
, that the Revolving Credit Commitment of each such Eligible Assignee shall be in an amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof.
     
(d) On each Increase Date, each Eligible Assignee that accepts an offer to participate in a requested Commitment Increase in accordance with Section 2.18(c) (each such Eligible Assignee and each Eligible Assignee that agrees to an extension of the Termination Date in accordance with Section 2.19(c), an "
Assuming Lender
") shall become a Lender party to this Agreement as of such Increase Date and the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Increasing Lender for such requested Commitment Increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such Lender pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.18(b)) as of such Increase Date;
provided
,
however
, that the Agent shall have received on or before such Increase Date the following, each dated such date:

(New York City time), by telecopier, of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase to be effected on such Increase Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall, before 2:00 P.M.

amount equal to the excess of (i) such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Revolving Credit Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Revolving Credit Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) over (ii) such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Revolving Credit Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Revolving Credit Commitment (without giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) as a percentage of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments (without giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase).

SECTION 2.19.
Extension of Termination Date
. (a) At least 45 days but not more than 60 days prior to any anniversary of the Effective Date, the Company, by written notice to the Agent, may request an extension of the Termination Date in effect at such time by one year from its then scheduled expiration. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall in turn, in its sole discretion, not later than 20 days prior to such anniversary date, notify the Company and the Agent in writing as to whether such Lender will consent to such extension. If any Lender shall fail to notify the Agent and the Company in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the Termination Date at least 20 days prior to the applicable anniversary date, such Lender shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender with respect to such request. The Agent shall notify the Company not later than 15 days prior to the applicable anniversary date of the decision of the Lenders regarding the Company's request for an extension of the Termination Date.
     
(b) If all the Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, the Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable anniversary date (the "
Extension Date
"), be extended for one year;
provided
that on each Extension Date the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.03 shall be satisfied. If fewer than all of the Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, the Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable Extension Date and subject to subsection (d) of this Section 2.19, be extended as to those Lenders that so consented (each a "
Consenting Lender
") but shall not be extended as to any other Lender (each a "
Non-Consenting Lender
"). To the extent that the Termination Date is not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19 and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c) of this Section 2.19 on or prior to the applicable Extension Date, each Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Company, such Lender or any other Person;
provided
that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 8.05, shall survive the Termination Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date. It is understood and agreed that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the Company for any requested extension of the Termination Date.
     
(c) If fewer than all of the Lenders consent to any such request pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, the Agent shall promptly so notify the Consenting Lenders, and each Consenting Lender may, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Agent not later than 10 days prior to the Termination Date of the amount of the Non-Consenting Lenders' Commitments for which it is willing to accept an assignment. If the Consenting Lenders notify the Agent that they are willing to accept assignments of Commitments in an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the Commitments of the Non-Consenting Lenders, such Commitments shall be allocated among the Consenting Lenders willing to accept such assignments in such amounts as are agreed between the Company and the Agent. If after giving effect to the assignments of Commitments described above there remain any Commitments of Non-Consenting Lenders, the Company may arrange for one or more Consenting Lenders or other Eligible Assignees as Assuming Lenders to assume, effective as of the Extension Date, any Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment and all of the obligations of such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement thereafter arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Non-Consenting Lender;
provided
,
however
, that the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $25,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is less than $25,000,000, in which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; and
provided
further
that:
provided
further
that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 8.05, shall survive such substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date of substitution. At least three Business Days prior to any Extension Date, (A) each such Assuming Lender, if any, shall have delivered to the Company and the Agent an Assumption Agreement, duly executed by such Assuming Lender, such Non-Consenting Lender, the Company and the Agent, (B) any such Consenting Lender shall have delivered confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Company and the Agent as to the increase in the amount of its Commitment and (C) each Non-Consenting Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall have delivered to the Agent any Note or Notes held by such Non-Consenting Lender. Upon the payment or prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, each such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender, as of the Extension Date, will be substituted for such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement and shall be a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other
Lenders, and the obligations of each such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged.
     
     (d) If (after giving effect to any assignments or assumptions pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.19) Lenders having Revolving Credit Commitments equal to at least 50% of the Revolving Credit Commitments in effect immediately prior to the Extension Date consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an Assumption Agreement or otherwise) not later than one Business Day prior to such Extension Date, the Agent shall so notify the Company, and, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions in Section 3.03, the Termination Date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period as described in subsection (a) of this Section 2.19, and all references in this Agreement, and in the Notes, if any, to the "
Termination Date
" shall, with respect to each Consenting Lender and each Assuming Lender for such Extension Date, refer to the Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each Extension Date, the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) of the extension of the scheduled Termination Date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each such Consenting Lender and each such Assuming Lender.

,

Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Lender hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each Lender contained in this Section 8.05 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes. Each of the Agents and each Issuing Bank agrees to return to the Lenders their respective Ratable Shares of any amounts paid under this Section 8.05 that are subsequently reimbursed by the Company or any Borrower.

provided
,
however
, that such assigning Lender's rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 8.05, shall survive such assignment as to matters occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment).
     
(b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by such Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

SECTION 9.07.
Designated Subsidiaries
. (a)
Designation
. The Company may at any time, and from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days' notice in the case of any Subsidiary so designated after the Effective Date, notify the Agent that the Company intends to designate a Subsidiary as a "Designated Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement. On or after the date that is 15 Business Days after such notice, upon delivery to the Agent and each Lender
of a Designation Letter duly executed by the Company and the respective Subsidiary and substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, such Subsidiary shall thereupon become a "Designated Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement and, as such, shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Borrower hereunder. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Company's notice of such pending designation by the Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary. Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 9.07(a), if the designation of such Designated Subsidiary obligates the Agent or any Lender to comply with "know your customer" or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Agent or any
Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lender in order for the Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations.
     
If the Company shall designate as a Designated Subsidiary hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Agent and the Company, fulfill its Commitment by causing an Affiliate of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of such Designated Subsidiary (and such Lender shall, to the extent of Advances made to and participations in Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Designated Subsidiary, be deemed for all purposes hereof to have
pro tanto
assigned such Advances and participations to such Affiliate in compliance with the provisions of Section 9.06) .
     
As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Agent of the Company's intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Designated Borrower, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, for a Designated Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Designated Subsidiary directly or through an Affiliate of such Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph (a "Protesting Lender") shall so notify the Company and the Agent in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Designated Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated;
provided
that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances and/or Letter of Credit reimbursement obligations, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Designated Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate such Subsidiary as a "Designated Subsidiary" hereunder.
     
(b)
Termination
. Upon the payment and performance in full of all of the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes of any Designated Subsidiary then, so long as at the time no Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing or Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing in respect of such Designated Subsidiary is outstanding, such Subsidiary's status as a "Designated Subsidiary" shall terminate upon notice to such effect from the Agent to the Lenders (which notice the Agent shall give promptly upon its receipt of a request therefor from the Company). Thereafter, the Lenders shall be under no further obligation to make any Advance hereunder to such Designated Subsidiary.
     
SECTION 9.08.
Confidentiality
. Each of the Lenders and the Agent hereby agrees that it will use reasonable efforts (e.g., procedures substantially comparable to those applied by such Lender or the Agent in respect of non-public information as to the business of such Lender or the Agent) to keep confidential any financial reports and other information from time to time supplied to it by the Company hereunder to the extent that such information is not and does not become publicly available and which the Company indicates at the time is to be treated confidentially,
provided
,
however
, that nothing herein shall affect the disclosure of any such information (i) by the Agent to any Lender, (ii) to the extent required by law (including statute,
rule, regulation or judicial process), (iii) to counsel for any Lender or the Agent or to their respective independent public accountants, (iv) to bank examiners and auditors and appropriate government examining authorities, (v) to the Agent or any other Lender, (vi) in connection with any litigation to which any Lender or the Agent is a party, (vii) to actual or prospective assignees and participants as contemplated by Section 9.06(f), (viii) to any Affiliate of the Agent or any Lender or to such Affiliate's officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors,
provided
that, prior to any such disclosure, such Affiliate or such Affiliate's officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors, as the case may be, shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the Company received by it or (ix) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any securitization, swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrowers, any Subsidiary of the Company, and the Obligations; a determination by a Lender or the Agent as to the application of the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i)-(viii) being conclusive if made in good faith; and each of the Lenders and the Agent agrees that it will follow procedures which are intended to put any transferee of such confidential information on notice that such information is confidential.
     
SECTION 9.09.
Mitigation of Yield Protection
. Each Lender hereby agrees that, commencing as promptly as practicable after it becomes aware of the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.11(a), 2.12 or 2.14 with respect to such Lender, such Lender will give notice thereof through the Agent to the respective Borrower. A Borrower may at any time, by notice through the Agent to any Lender, request that such Lender change its Applicable Lending Office as to any Advance or Type of Advance or that it specify a new Applicable Lending Office with respect to its Commitment and any Advance held by it or that it rebook any such Advance with a view to avoiding or mitigating the consequences of an occurrence such as described in the preceding sentence, and such Lender will use reasonable efforts to comply with such request unless, in the opinion of such Lender, such change or specification or rebooking is inadvisable or might have an adverse effect, economic or otherwise, upon it, including its reputation. In addition, each Lender agrees that, except for changes or specifications or rebookings required by law or effected pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the result of any change or change of specification of Applicable Lending Office or rebooking would, but for this sentence, be to impose additional costs or requirements upon the respective Borrower pursuant to Section 2.11(a), Section 2.12 or Section 2.14 (which would not be imposed absent such change or change of specification or rebooking) by reason of legal or regulatory requirements in effect at the time thereof and of which such Lender is aware at such time, then such costs or requirements shall not be imposed upon such Borrower but shall be borne by such Lender. All expenses incurred by any Lender in changing an Applicable Lending Office or specifying another Applicable Lending Office of such Lender or rebooking any Advance in response to a request from a Borrower shall be paid by such Borrower. Nothing in this Section 9.09 (including, without limitation, any failure by a Lender to give any notice contemplated in the first sentence hereof) shall limit, reduce or postpone any obligations of the respective Borrower under Section 2.11(a), Section 2.12 or Section 2.14, including any obligations payable in respect of any period prior to the date of any change or specification of a new Applicable Lending Office or any rebooking of any Advance.
     
SECTION 9.10.

Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
     
SECTION 9.12.
Jurisdiction, Etc
. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each Designated Subsidiary hereby agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding brought in the any such New York State court or in such federal court may be made upon the Company at its address specified in Section 9.02, and each Designated Subsidiary hereby irrevocably appoints the Company its authorized agent to accept such service of process, and agrees that the failure of the Company to give any notice of any such service shall not impair or affect the validity of such service or of any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. Each Borrower hereby further irrevocably consents to the service of process in any action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing thereof by any parties hereto by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Borrower at its address specified pursuant to Section 9.02. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction. To the extent that each Designated Subsidiary has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, each Designated Subsidiary hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement.
     
(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New York State or federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
     
SECTION 9.13.
Substitution of Currency
. If a change in any Foreign Currency occurs pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental, monetary or multi-national authority, this Agreement (including, without limitation, the definitions of Eurocurrency Rate and LIBO Rate) will be amended to the extent determined by the Agent (acting reasonably and in consultation with the Company) to be necessary to reflect the change in currency
and to put the Lenders and the Borrowers in the same position, so far as possible, that they would have been in if no change in such Foreign Currency had occurred.
     
SECTION 9.14.
Final Agreement
. This written agreement represents the full and final agreement between the parties with respect to the matters addressed herein and supersedes all prior communications, written or oral, with respect thereto. There are no unwritten agreements between the parties.
     
SECTION 9.15.
Judgment
. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under the Notes in any currency (the "
Original Currency
") into another currency (the "
Other Currency
"), the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency at 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the first Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.

__________ __, 2007
To each of the Lenders parties      to the Credit Agreement      (as defined below),      and to Citicorp USA, Inc.,      as Agent for said Lenders
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(e)(iv) of the Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement dated as of May 14, 2007, among Honeywell International Inc. (the "
Company
"), the Lenders parties thereto, and Citicorp USA, Inc., as Agent for said Lenders (the "
Credit Agreement
"). Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are, unless otherwise defined herein, used herein as therein defined.
          
I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
          
In that connection I have examined:
     
          
     (1) The Credit Agreement
(2) The documents furnished by the Company pursuant to Article III of the Credit Agreement, including the Certificate of Incorporationof the Company and all 
     
amendments thereto (the "
Charter
") and the By-laws of the Company and all amendments
thereto (the "
By-laws
").
(3) A certificate of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, dated as of a  
     
recent date, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the
Company in that State.
          
I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company (including resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company), certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter
expressed. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of the Company or its officers or of public officials.
          
In rendering the opinions set forth below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. I have also assumed the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all natural persons and, with respect to all parties to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company, that such parties had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding, and enforceable obligations of such parties.
          
I am qualified to practice law in the State of New York, and I do not purport to be expert in, or to express any opinion herein concerning, any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States.
          
Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:
     1. The Company (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (b) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation in each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases property or in which the conduct of its business requires it to so qualify or be licensed, except where the failure to be so qualified would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect and (c) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted.
     2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes of the Company, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Company's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not (i) contravene the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) violate any law (including, without limitation, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Chapter of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970), rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or any material order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or award or (iii) conflict with or result in the breach of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, loan or credit agreement, lease, mortgage, security agreement, bond, note or any similar document. The Credit Agreement and the Notes of the Company have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company.
     
3. No authorization, approval, or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority, administrative agency or regulatory body, or any third party is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Company, or for the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
     4. The Credit Agreement is, and each Note of the Company when delivered under the Credit Agreement will be, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or other similar laws relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except that I express no opinion as to (i) the subject matter jurisdiction of the District Courts of the United States of America to adjudicate any controversy relating to the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Company or (ii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction (other than the State of New York) wherein any Lender or Applicable Lending Office may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Company may be sought which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected by such Lender.
     
5. There is no action, suit, investigation, litigation or proceeding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator now pending or, to the best of my knowledge, Threatened that is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (other than as disclosed in public filings prior to the date hereof) or that purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any Note of the Company or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and there has been no adverse change in the status, or financial effect on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of the matters disclosed in public filings prior to the date hereof.
     
6. The Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
          
In connection with the opinions expressed by me above in paragraph 4, I wish to point out that (i) provisions of the Credit Agreement that permit the Agent or any Lender to take action or make determinations may be subject to a requirement that such action be taken or such determinations be made on a reasonable basis and in good faith, (ii) that a party to whom an advance is owed may, under certain circumstances, be called upon to prove the outstanding amount of the Advances evidenced thereby, (iii) the rights of the Agent and the Lenders provided for in Section 9.04(b) of the Credit Agreement may be limited in certain circumstances and (iv) I express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any indemnity against loss in converting into a specified currency the proceeds or amount of a court judgment in another currency.
          
I do not express any opinion on any matter not expressly addressed above. The opinions set forth herein are delivered based solely upon the examinations, assumptions and other matters described herein as of the date hereof, and I undertake no obligation to modify or
supplement this opinion letter or otherwise to communicate with you with respect to changes in law or matters which occur or come to my attention after the date hereof.
          
This opinion letter is given for the sole and exclusive benefit of the addressees hereof and may not be relied upon by or delivered or disclosed to any other person, except that any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement after the date hereof may rely on these opinions as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such Lender on the date hereof. In addition, this opinion letter relates only to the matters, the opinions and the transaction specifically referred to or provided herein, and no other opinions should be implied therefrom.

The Credit Agreement and the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary are, and each Note of the Designated Subsidiary when delivered under the Credit Agreement will be, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Designated Subsidiary enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or other similar laws relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except that I express no opinion as to (i) the subject matter jurisdiction of the District Courts of the United States of America to adjudicate any controversy relating to the Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary or (ii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction (other than the State of New York) wherein any Lender or Applicable Lending Office may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary may be sought which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected by such Lender.
     
4. There is no action, suit, investigation, litigation or proceeding at law or in equity before any court, governmental agency or arbitration now pending or, to the best of my knowledge and belief, Threatened against the Designated Subsidiary that is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or that purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary, the Credit Agreement or any Note of the Designated Subsidiary or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
     
5. No authorizations, consents, approvals, licenses, filings or registrations by or with any governmental authority or administrative body are required for the due
execution, delivery and performance by the Designated Subsidiary of its Designation Letter, the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary except for such authorizations, consents, approvals, licenses, filings or registrations as have heretofore been made, obtained or affected and are in full force and effect.
    6. The Designated Subsidiary is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
          
In connection with the opinions expressed by me above in paragraph 3, I wish to point out that (i) provisions of the Credit Agreement which permit the Agent or any Lender to take action or make determinations may be subject to a requirement that such action be taken or such determinations be made on a reasonable basis and in good faith, (ii) a party to whom an advance is owed may, under certain circumstances, be called upon to prove the outstanding amount of the Advances evidenced thereby, (iii) the rights of the Agent and the Lenders provided for in Section 9.04(b) of the Credit Agreement may be limited in certain circumstances and (iv) I express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any indemnity against loss in converting into a specified currency the proceeds or amount of a court judgment in another currency.
          
I do not express any opinion on any matter not expressly addressed above. The opinions set forth herein are delivered based solely upon the examinations, assumptions and other matters described herein as of the date hereof, and I undertake no obligation to modify or supplement this opinion letter or otherwise to communicate with you with respect to changes in law or matters which occur or come to my attention after the date hereof.
          
This opinion letter is given for the sole and exclusive benefit of the addressees hereof and may not be relied upon by or delivered or disclosed to any other person, except that any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement after the date hereof may rely on these opinions as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such Lender on the date hereof.

__________ __, 2007
To the Initial Lenders party to the Credit Agreement referred to below and to Citicorp USA, Inc., as Agent
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     
We have acted as counsel to Citicorp USA, Inc., as Agent (the "
Agent
"), in connection with the Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement, dated as of May 14, 2007 (the "
Credit Agreement
"), among Honeywell International Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
Borrower
"), and each of you. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
     
In that connection, we have reviewed originals or copies of the following documents:
     (a)
The Credit Agreement.
     (b)
The Notes executed by the Borrower and delivered on the date hereof.
The documents described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) are collectively referred to herein as the "
Opinion Documents
."
     
We have also reviewed originals or copies of such other agreements and documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinion expressed below.
     In our review of the Opinion Documents and other documents, we have assumed:
     We have not independently established the validity of the foregoing assumptions.
     
"
Generally Applicable Law
" means the federal law of the United States of America, and the law of the State of New York (including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto), that a New York lawyer exercising customary professional
diligence would reasonably be expected to recognize as being applicable to the Borrower, the Opinion Documents or the transactions governed by the Opinion Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Generally Applicable Law, the term "Generally Applicable Law" does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Borrower, the Opinion Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Opinion Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
     
Based upon the foregoing and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that each Opinion Document is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.
     Our opinion expressed above is subject to the following qualifications:
     
(a) Our opinion is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers).
     
(b) Our opinion is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     
(c) We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of indemnification provisions, or of release or exculpation provisions, contained in the Opinion Documents to the extent that enforcement thereof is contrary to public policy regarding the indemnification against or release or exculpation of criminal violations, intentional harm or violations of securities laws.
     
(d) We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any indemnity against loss in converting into a specified currency the proceeds or amount of a court judgment in another currency.
     (e) Our opinion is limited to Generally Applicable Law.
     
A copy of this opinion letter may be delivered by any of you to any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any such person may rely on the opinion expressed above as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof.
     
This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Opinion Documents. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you or any person entitled to rely on this opinion pursuant to the preceding paragraph for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
     
This opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise you of any development or circumstance of any kind, including any change of law or fact, that may occur after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinion expressed herein.
