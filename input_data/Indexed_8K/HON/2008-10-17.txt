HONEYWELL THIRD QUARTER SALES UP 6% TO $9.3 BILLION; EARNINGS UP 20% TO $0.97 PER SHARE
 
 
MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., October 17, 2008 -- Honeywell (
NYSE: HON
) today announced third quarter 2008 sales of $9.3 billion, an increase of 6% versus the prior year. Earnings per share of $0.97 compares to $0.81 in the prior year, up 20%. Cash flow from operations was $769 million versus $910 million last year, and free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) was $556 million versus $736 million in the third quarter of 2007, primarily due to increased cash tax payments in the quarter. In the third quarter, Honeywell completed the sale of its Consumables Solutions business resulting in a pre-tax gain of $0.6 billion. Also during the third quarter, the company executed approximately $0.6 billion of repositioning, environmental and other actions across its businesses.
"We believe that demand for Honeywell's differentiated technologies and solutions, combined with our great positions in good industries, will help the company outperform despite tougher global economic conditions. We continue to benefit from our large installed base, emerging regions presence and balance of long-and-short-cycle businesses," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. "In a more difficult environment, our conservative planning, proactive cost management, and common systems, processes and productivity initiatives are helping the company to deliver sustained earnings growth."
Honeywell forecasts 2008 sales of approximately $37.2 billion, up 8% and narrowed its earnings per share range to $3.76 - 3.80, up 19% - 20% versus the prior year. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $3.2 billion (cash flow from operations of $4.1 billion).

We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment.
We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
