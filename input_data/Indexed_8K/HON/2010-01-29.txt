Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
 
Honeywell International Inc. (the "Company") held an investor conference call and webcast this morning on which it provided guidance regarding estimated first quarter 2010 sales and earnings per share (EPS). The Company is clarifying that the first quarter 2010 EPS guidance presented on the call/webcast included planning assumptions related to a potential negative $0.04-$0.05 per share impact from proposed health care legislation that would repeal federal tax deductions related to certain employee medical benefits, which would result in a reversal of a deferred tax asset and a one-time expense in the quarter in which such legislation is enacted. No assurances can be given that proposed health care legislation will be enacted in its current form or as to the timing of enactment of any such legislation.
