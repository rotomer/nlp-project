Exhibit 99.1
     
MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., February 14, 2011 - Honeywell

today announced that it has commenced a cash tender offer (the "Offer") for any and all of its $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% notes due 2012 (CUSIP No. 438516AV8) (the "Notes").
     
The Offer is being made upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated February 14, 2011 (the "Offer to Purchase") and related letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which collectively set forth the terms of the Offer. The Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 22, 2011, unless such date is extended (the "Expiration Date"). Tendered Notes may not be withdrawn after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date, unless such date is extended. Settlement of each validly tendered Note is expected to be the first business day after the Expiration Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter. The following table sets forth certain terms of the Offer.
     
Holders of Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 22, 2011 and accepted for purchase will receive the tender offer consideration described in the Offer and the table above for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase, calculated by the Dealer Managers as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 22, 2011. Holders whose Notes have been accepted for purchase will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on
Tender of Notes - 2
the purchased Notes from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, the date of payment for purchased Notes.
     
Honeywell's obligation to accept and pay for the Notes validly tendered in the Offer is conditioned on, among other things, the concurrent successful offering of new senior notes (the "New Notes") and that the net proceeds of the New Notes are sufficient to purchase the Notes validly tendered in the Offer.
     
Honeywell intends to finance the payment for the Notes tendered pursuant to the Offer with a portion of the proceeds raised from the New Notes. Honeywell has reserved the right to terminate, withdraw, amend or extend the Offer in its discretion.
     
BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, and Citi are acting as dealer managers (the "Dealer Managers"), and Global Bondholder Services Corporation is acting as information agent (the "Information Agent"), each for the Offer. Holders of the Notes can obtain copies of the Offer to Purchase and related materials from Global Bondholder Services Corporation, 65 Broadway, Suite 404, New York, New York 10006, Attn: Corporate Actions. Banks and Brokers may call: (866) 470-3900 (toll-free) or (212) 430-3774 (collect).

Holders must make their own decisions as to whether to tender the Notes, and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender.
This press release is not an offer to purchase, a solicitation of an offer to purchase, or an offer to sell any New Notes. The Offer is being made only pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Purchase, and the related letter of transmittal. In any jurisdiction where the laws require the Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer will be deemed made on behalf of Honeywell by the Dealer Managers, or one or more registered broker or dealers under the laws of such jurisdiction.
