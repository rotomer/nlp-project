On March 31, 2011, Honeywell entered into a $2.8 billion Five Year Credit Agreement (the ) with the banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders party to the Credit Agreement, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent , Citibank International PLC, as swing line agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Morgan Stanley MUFG Loan Partners, LLC and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, as documentation agents, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and co-book managers. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $3.5 billion.
Credit Agreement
 
The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper. The Credit Agreement replaces the previously reported $2.8 billion five year credit agreement dated as of May 14, 2007 (the ), which is now terminated. No borrowings were outstanding at any time under the Prior Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes a $700 million sublimit for the potential issuance of multi currency letters of credit and a EUR200 million sublimit for swing line advances.
Prior Agreement
 
The Credit Agreement has substantially the same material terms and conditions as the Prior Agreement. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than March 31, 2016, unless such date is extended pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.
 
The Credit Agreement does not restrict Honeywells ability to pay dividends, nor does it contain financial covenants. The failure to comply with customary conditions or the occurrence of customary events of default contained in the Credit Agreement would prevent any further borrowings and would generally require the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Such events of default include, among other things, (a) non-payment of Credit Agreement debt, interest or fees; (b) non-compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement covenants; (c) cross-default with other debt in certain circumstances; (d) bankruptcy or insolvency; and (e) defaults on certain obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Additionally, each of the lenders has the right to terminate its commitment to lend additional funds or issue additional letters of credit under the Credit Agreement if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30 percent or more of Honeywells voting stock, or, during any 12-month period, individuals who were directors of Honeywell at the beginning of the period cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors.
 
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement would bear interest, at Honeywells option, either at (A) a variable annual rate equal to the highest of (1)(a) the base rate publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., (b)  of 1.00% per annum above the Federal funds rate, and (c) the London interbank offered rate applicable to dollars for a period of one month, as determined by reference to Reuters LIBOR01 Page, plus 1.00%, plus (2) a rate based on Honeywells credit default swap mid-rate spread for a period equal to the remaining term of the lenders commitment or, if such term is longer than one year, a one-year period, and subject to a floor and a cap as set forth in the Credit Agreement (the Applicable Margin) minus 1.00% provided such total exceeds zero; or (B) a rate equal to (1) London interbank offered rate (adjusted upward to reflect bank reserve costs) for a period of one, two, three, six, nine or 12 months, plus (2) the Applicable Margin.
 
Honeywell has agreed to pay a commitment fee for the aggregate commitment for the Credit Agreement, which is subject to change, based upon a grid determined by Honeywells long-term debt ratings. The Credit Agreement is not subject to termination based upon a decrease in Honeywells debt ratings or a Material Adverse Change (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
 
The description of the Credit Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

No Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date (including all rights of the applicable Borrower or the beneficiary to require renewal) of later than the Termination Date, that no Letter of Credit may expire after the Termination Date of any Non-Consenting Lender if, after giving effect to such issuance, the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of the Consenting Lenders (including any replacement Lenders) for the period following such Termination Date would be less than the Available Amount of the Letters of Credit expiring after such Termination Date.

                    (d) Each Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing and Notice of Swing Line Borrowing of any Borrower shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower. In the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that the related Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Borrower requesting such Revolving Credit Borrowing shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure by such Borrower to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing for such Revolving Credit Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing when such Revolving Credit Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. The Borrower requesting a Swing Line Borrowing shall indemnify each Swing Line Bank against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Swing Line Bank as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Swing Line Borrowing for such Swing Line Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Swing Line Bank to fund the Swing Line Advance to be made by such Swing Line Bank as part of such Swing Line Borrowing when such Swing Line Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.
                    (e) (i) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower proposing such Revolving Credit Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (x) in the case of such Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (y) in the case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in any Major Currency. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Credit Advance as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.
                    (ii) Unless the Swing Line Agent shall have received notice from a Swing Line Bank prior to 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the day of any Swing Line Borrowing that such Swing Line Bank will not make available to the Swing Line Agent such Swing Line Bank's ratable portion of such Swing Line Borrowing, the Swing Line Agent may assume that such Swing Line Bank has made such portion available to the Swing Line Agent on the date of such Swing Line Borrowing in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 2.02 and the Swing Line Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower proposing such Swing Line Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Swing Line Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Swing Line Agent such Swing Line Bank and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Swing Line Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Swing Line Agent at (x) in the case of such Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to Swing Line Advances comprising such Swing Line Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Swing Line Agent in respect of such amount, and (y) in the case of such Swing Line Bank, the cost of funds incurred by the Swing Line Agent in respect of such amount. If such Swing Line Bank shall repay to the Swing Line Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Swing Line Bank's Swing Line Advance as part of such Swing Line Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.
                    (f) (i) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing.
                    (ii) The failure of any Swing Line Bank to make the Swing Line Advance to be made by it as part of any Swing Line Borrowing shall not relieve any other Swing Line Bank of its obligation hereunder to make its Swing Line Advance on the date of such Swing Line Borrowing, but no Swing Line Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Swing Line Bank to make the Swing Line Advance to be made by such other Swing Line Bank on the date of any Swing Line Borrowing.
                    (g) If the respective Unused Commitments of the Lenders on the first day of an Interest Period for any Revolving Credit Borrowing are different from the respective Unused Commitments of the Lenders on the last day of such Interest Period, the Agent shall so notify the Lenders and the respective Revolving Credit Advances shall be reallocated among the Lenders so that, after giving effect to such reallocation, the Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing and continuing into the subsequent Interest Period are funded by the Lenders ratably according to their respective Unused Commitments on such last day. Each Lender agrees that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.03 shall not apply to any additional amounts required to be funded by such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.02(g).
                    SECTION 2.03. . (a) Each Lender severally agrees that any Borrower may request Competitive Bid Borrowings under this Section 2.03 from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the date hereof until the date occurring seven days prior to the Termination Date in the manner set forth below; that, following the making of each Competitive Bid Borrowing, the aggregate amount (based in respect of any Advance denominated in a Foreign Currency on the Equivalent in Dollars on such Business Day) of the Advances and the aggregate Available Amount of Letters of Credit then outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Competitive Bid Borrowing may be made in a Foreign Currency if, after giving effect to the making of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, the Equivalent in Dollars of the aggregate amount of outstanding Competitive Bid Advances denominated in Foreign Currencies, together with the Equivalent in Dollars of the aggregate amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Major Currencies, would exceed $500,000,000.

                    (c) Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this Section 2.03, any Borrower may from time to time borrow under this Section 2.03, repay or prepay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this Section 2.03, that a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall not be made within three Business Days of the date of any other Competitive Bid Borrowing.
provided
                    (d) Any Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall repay to the Agent for the account of each Lender that has made a Competitive Bid Advance, on the maturity date of such Competitive Bid Advance (such maturity date being that specified by such Borrower for repayment of such Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above and provided in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance), the then unpaid principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance. Such Borrower shall have no right to prepay any principal amount of any Competitive Bid Advance unless, and then only on the terms, specified by such Borrower for such Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above and set forth in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance.
                    (e) Each Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance comprising such Competitive Bid Borrowing from the date of such Competitive Bid Advance to the date the principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such Competitive Bid Advance specified by the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance in its notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) above, payable on the interest payment date or dates specified by such Borrower for such Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above, as provided in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance.

                    (f) The indebtedness of any Borrower resulting from each Competitive Bid Advance made to such Borrower as part of a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be evidenced by a separate Competitive Bid Note of such Borrower payable to the order of the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance.

If (A) the requested form of such Letter of Credit, in the reasonable judgment of the Issuing Bank, conforms to standard practices of financial institutions that regularly issue letters of credit, (B) the issuance of a letter of credit to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Issuing Bank, violate or conflict with (y) any regulatory or legal restriction applicable to the Issuing Bank, or (z) any internal policy, procedure or guideline of, the Issuing Bank that is consistent with standard practices of financial institutions that regularly issue letters of credit and (C) the Issuing Bank has not received written notice form any Lender, the Agent or any Borrower, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Section 3.03 shall not be satisfied, then such Issuing Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, make such Letter of Credit available to the Borrower requesting such issuance at its office referred to in Section 9.02 or as otherwise agreed with such Borrower in connection with such issuance. In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Application shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. An Issuing Bank that issues a Letter of Credit which expires prior to the Termination Date but provides for automatic extension of the expiry date will not exercise its right to prevent the automatic extension of the expiry date unless (i) the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.03 are not satisfied as to the date of such Issuing Bank's required notice of non-extension, or (ii) such automatic extension would extend the expiry date beyond the Termination Date.

Each Issuing Bank shall give prompt notice (and such Issuing Bank will use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such notice within one Business Day) of each drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it to the Company, the applicable Borrower (if not the Company) and the Agent. Upon written demand by such Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the Agent and the Company, each Lender shall pay to the Agent such Lender's Ratable Share of such outstanding Revolving Credit Advance, by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Credit Advance to be funded by such Lender, that the Lenders shall not be required to fund such Revolving Credit Advances resulting from drawings under a Letter of Credit denominated in any Major Currency until such Advance is exchanged for the Equivalent in Dollars and is a Base Rate Advance. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make Revolving Credit Advances pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent shall transfer such funds to such Issuing Bank. Each Lender agrees to fund its Ratable Share of an outstanding Revolving Credit Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by such Issuing Bank, that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Revolving Credit Advance available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by any such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account of such Issuing Bank,

In addition, each Lender further agrees to provide any Borrower with any form or document as any Borrower may reasonably request which is required by any taxing authority outside the United States in order to secure an exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, withholding tax in such jurisdiction, if available to such Lender. If the forms provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement or changes its Applicable Lending Office indicate a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; , , that, in the case of a Lender that initially becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to an assignment in accordance with Section 9.06 or a Lender that undertakes a change in its Applicable Lending Office, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable on the date of such assignment or change with respect to the assignee Lender or Lender after the change in Applicable Lending Office, but only to the extent of United States withholding tax included in Taxes, if any, applicable on the date of such assignment or change with respect to the assignor Lender or Lender prior to such change in Applicable Lending Office.

such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

Company
Credit Agreement
                    I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement. I have also acted as special counsel for ___________, ___________, ___________ and ___________ (each, a "") in connection with the Credit Agreement.
Designated Subsidiary
                    In that connection I have examined:
                    I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company and the Designated Subsidiaries (including resolutions adopted by the respective Board of Directors of each of the Company and the Designated Subsidiaries), certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company and the Designated Subsidiaries, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of the Company and the Designated Subsidiaries or their respective officers or of public officials.
                    In rendering the opinions set forth below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. I have also assumed the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all natural persons and, with respect to all parties to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company, that such parties had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding, and enforceable obligations of such parties.

                    Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:
                    In connection with the opinions expressed by me above in paragraph 4, I wish to point out that (i) provisions of the Credit Agreement that permit the Agent or any Lender to take action or make determinations may be subject to a requirement that such action be taken or such determinations be made on a reasonable basis and in good faith, (ii) that a party to whom an advance is owed may, under certain circumstances, be called upon to prove the outstanding amount of the Advances evidenced thereby, (iii) the rights of the Agent and the Lenders provided for in Section 9.04(b) of the Credit Agreement may be limited in certain circumstances and (iv) I express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any indemnity against loss in converting into a specified currency the proceeds or amount of a court judgment in another currency.
                    I do not express any opinion on any matter not expressly addressed above. The opinions set forth herein are delivered based solely upon the examinations, assumptions and other matters described herein as of the date hereof, and I undertake no obligation to modify or supplement this opinion letter or otherwise to communicate with you with respect to changes in law or matters which occur or come to my attention after the date hereof.
                    This opinion letter is given for the sole and exclusive benefit of the addressees hereof and may not be relied upon by or delivered or disclosed to any other person, except that any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement after the date hereof may rely on these opinions as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such Lender on the date hereof.

                    We have not independently established the validity of the foregoing assumptions.
                    "" means the federal law of the United States of America, and the law of the State of New York (including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto), that a New York lawyer exercising customary professional
Generally Applicable Law
diligence would reasonably be expected to recognize as being applicable to the Borrower, the Opinion Documents or the transactions governed by the Opinion Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Generally Applicable Law, the term "Generally Applicable Law" does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Borrower, the Opinion Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Opinion Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
                    Based upon the foregoing and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that each Opinion Document is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.
                    Our opinion expressed above is subject to the following qualifications:
                    (a) Our opinion is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers).
          (b) Our opinion is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          (c) We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of indemnification provisions, or of release or exculpation provisions, contained in the Opinion Documents to the extent that enforcement thereof is contrary to public policy regarding the indemnification against or release or exculpation of criminal violations, intentional harm or violations of securities laws.
          (d) We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any indemnity against loss in converting into a specified currency the proceeds or amount of a court judgment in another currency.
          (e) We express no opinion with respect to Section 9.12 of the Credit Agreement to the extent that such Section (i) implies that a federal court of the United States has subject matter jurisdiction or (ii) purports to grant any court exclusive jurisdiction.
                    (f) Our opinion is limited to Generally Applicable Law.
                    A copy of this opinion letter may be delivered by any of you to any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any such person may rely on the opinion expressed above as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof.
                    This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Opinion Documents. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you or any
person entitled to rely on this opinion pursuant to the preceding paragraph for any other purpose without our prior written consent.

We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise you of any development or circumstance of any kind, including any change of law or fact, that may occur after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinion expressed herein.
