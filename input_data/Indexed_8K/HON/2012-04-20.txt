HONEYWELL FIRST QUARTER SALES UP 7% TO $9.3 BILLION;

MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., April 20, 2012 -- Honeywell () today announced its results for the first quarter of 2012:
NYSE: HON
 
 
Honeywell had a terrific start to the year highlighted by higher than expected organic sales, 70 basis points of margin expansion, and strong double-digit earnings growth, said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. Weve seen good momentum in the U.S. and our key high growth regions, which is more than offsetting softness in Europe impacting our short-cycle businesses. Our long-cycle businesses, namely commercial aerospace and UOP, had particularly strong growth, overdriving expectations in the quarter. As a result of our strong first quarter and continued favorable outlook for our major markets, were raising our 2012 earnings per share outlook. Our continued seed planting, coupled with great positions in good industries and the Five Initiatives  growth, productivity, cash, people, and our enablers - will remain the keys to our continued outperformance in 2012 and over the long-term.

We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment.
We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, repay debt obligations prior to their maturities, or make cash pension contributions. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
Q1'12 Results - 10
We believe EPS, excluding mark-to-market pension expense and third quarter 2011 repositioning and other actions funded by CPG gain, is a metric that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.
EPS utilizes weighted average shares outstanding of 791.6 million and the effective tax rate for the period. Mark-to-market uses a blended tax rate of 36.9%.
