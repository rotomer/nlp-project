     SECTION 5. . The Corporation may issue uncertificated shares, or if requested by the registered owner, a new certificate or cause a new certificate to be issued, in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed.

Registered Owners
     SECTION 8. The Corporation will seek shareowner approval prior to its adoption of a Rights Plan, unless the Board, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties and with the concurrence of a majority of its independent directors, determines that, under the circumstances existing at the time, it is in the best interests of the Stockholders of the Corporation to adopt a Rights Plan without delay. If a Rights Plan is adopted by the Corporation without prior approval of the Stockholders of the Corporation, such plan must provide that it shall expire unless ratified by the Stockholders of the Corporation within one year of adoption. For purposes of this by-law, the term "Rights Plan" refers generally to any plan providing for the distribution of preferred stock, rights, warrants, options or debt instruments to the Stockholders of the Corporation, designed to deter non-negotiated takeovers by conferring certain rights on the Stockholders of the Corporation upon the occurrence of a "triggering event" such as a tender offer or third party acquisition of a specified percentage of stock.

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
          These By-laws or any of them may be amended or supplemented in any respect at any time, either (a) at any meeting of Stockholders, provided that any amendment or supplement proposed to be acted upon at any such meeting shall have been described or referred to in the notice of such meeting, or (b) at any meeting of the Board, provided that any amendment or supplement proposed to be acted upon at any such meeting shall have been described or referred to in the notice of such meeting or an announcement with respect thereto shall have been made at the last previous Board meeting.
