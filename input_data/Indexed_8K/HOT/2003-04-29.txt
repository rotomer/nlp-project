Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 29, 2003
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT) ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported results for the first quarter of 2003.
WHITE PLAINS, NY, April 29, 2003
First Quarter 2003 Financial Highlights
 
First Quarter Ended March 31, 2003
EPS was a loss of $0.58 in 2003, compared to income of $0.16 in 2002. EPS excluding special items was a loss of $0.08 in 2003 and income of $0.09 in 2002, and excludes net charges of approximately $100 million (after-tax) in 2003 primarily related to the impairment charge associated with the expected sale of the 18 Hotel Portfolio and net benefits of approximately $15 million (after-tax) in 2002 primarily associated with the foreign exchange gain related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Gains associated with the sales of the Principe and Sardinia Assets will be recognized when the sales are closed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Total Revenues declined slightly to $883 million when compared to $884 million in the same period of 2002. Total revenues, including other revenues from managed and franchised properties, were down slightly to $1.073 billion. EPS including discontinued operations was also a loss of $0.58 in the first quarter of 2003 compared to income of $0.16 in the same period of 2002
.
Comments from the CEO
"It is obvious that the travel environment in the first quarter of this year, traditionally our weakest quarter, was at maximum distress, in large part due to factors beyond our control," said Barry S. Sternlicht, Chairman and CEO. "In addition to revenue challenges, small increases in expenses (in areas like snow removal and energy) on a low revenue base exacerbated margin pressures. Furthermore, we are exposed to markets most impacted by the global slowdown, notably New York City and the Boston corridor."
"Nonetheless, there were some important bright notes in the quarter. The W, Westin and Sheraton brands posted industry leading full-service REVPAR results which helped the Company generate a nearly 1% gain in overall market share. In addition, our previously announced wage freeze will only begin to positively impact year over year comparisons as of April 1 and beyond. There are also signs that spiraling fixed costs may be moderating in areas like property insurance, terrorism insurance, energy and real estate taxes. Our brand
 
development pipeline remains strong and growing, despite worldwide turmoil. I remain optimistic for the back half of this year, assuming the SARS crisis dissipates."
Concluding, Mr. Sternlicht said, "Most significantly, in the quarter we placed over $600 million of assets under contract for sale and expect additional sales as well. Together, these sales will provide significant debt reduction, allow us to take advantage of external opportunities as they may arise, or fund accretive capital projects."
Hotel Operating Results
At the Company's Same-Store Owned Hotels worldwide, revenues for the first quarter of 2003 decreased approximately $7 million to $730 million from $737 million in 2002 and EBITDA for the period decreased 18.8% to $156 million from $193 million in 2002. EBITDA at the Company's Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America decreased 19.6% to $124 million in the first quarter of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002, primarily due to the impact of lower ADR, increased energy and insurance costs, reduced cancellation fees in 2003, and increased spending behind incremental sales hiring and marketing. EBITDA at the Company's Same-Store Owned Hotels internationally decreased 15.6% to approximately $32 million in the first quarter of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002. The positive effects of foreign exchange in Europe and Asia Pacific were partially offset by the weakening of currencies in South America. Excluding the net favorable effects of foreign exchange, EBITDA at the Company's Same-Store Owned Hotels internationally decreased 19.8% in the first quarter of 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002.
REVPAR at Same-Store Owned Hotels worldwide decreased 1.7% in the first quarter of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002 as a result of a decrease in occupancy rates of 40 basis points to 60.0% and a decrease in ADR of 1.1% from the prior year. REVPAR at Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America decreased 3.0% to $90.15 when compared to the same period of 2002 as a result of a decrease in ADR of 3.1% to $147.16, offset by a slight increase in occupancy rates to 61.3% from 61.2% in the prior year. REVPAR at system-wide operated hotels (Same-Store Owned and managed) in North America decreased 1.3% when compared to the same period of 2002 as a result of a decrease in ADR of 3.1%, offset by increases in occupancy rates to 62.6% from 61.4%. Internationally, Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 3.1%, with Europe up 9.6% and Asia Pacific up 23.6%, offset by declines in Latin America of 14.0% when compared to 2002.
EBITDA margins at Same-Store Owned Hotels worldwide were 21.4% in the first quarter of 2003 when compared to 26.1% in the same period of 2002. In North America, EBITDA margins at Same-Store Owned Hotels were 22.0% when compared to 26.7% in the same period of 2002. Internationally, EBITDA margins at Same-Store Owned Hotels were 19.6% when compared to 24.1% in the same period of 2002. The decline in North America EBITDA margins was due to the decrease in ADR while occupancy increased as well as difficult year-over-year comparisons as a result of the lease of the Sheraton Manhattan and portions of the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers to a major tenant for office use. Further, the Company's margins were significantly impacted by higher energy costs due to the extreme cold and snow storms that hit the East Coast in the first quarter of 2003 as well as increased insurance costs and reduced cancellation fees in 2003.
 
During the first quarter of 2003, the Company signed six hotel management and franchise contracts and opened seven new hotels and resorts including: The Sheraton Sanya Resort (Sanya, China, 511 rooms), the Sheraton and Westin at Our Lucaya Beach & Golf Resort (Lucaya, Bahamas, 1260 rooms), The Sheraton Krabi Resort (Krabi, Thailand, 246 rooms), and the Westin Leipzig Hotel (Leipzig, Germany, 447 rooms). Three new hotel openings scheduled for the second quarter of 2003 include: The Sheraton Saigon (Ho Chi Min, Vietnam, 383 rooms), and the Westin Charlotte, (Charlotte, North Carolina, 700 rooms). Including these properties, through the end of 2003, the Company expects to open 23 new full service hotels and resorts around the world. An additional 12 W Hotel projects are in the development pipeline as well as 20 Sheratons and 15 Westins, based on their flexible prototypes.
Vacation Ownership Operating Results
The Company's vacation ownership division, Starwood Vacation Ownership, Inc. (SVO), is currently selling VOI inventory at 11 resorts and engaged in pre-opening sales at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas in Maui, Hawaii currently under construction. For the first quarter of 2003, revenues from the timeshare business increased 14.4% to $93 million when compared to the same period in 2002 and EBITDA increased 20.1% to $22 million compared to $18 million in the same period of 2002. EBITDA margin in the first quarter of 2003 increased approximately 110 basis points to 23.2%. The average price of units sold during the quarter increased 28.9% to $19,820 per unit. Contract sales in the first quarter increased approximately 14.0% when compared to the same period in 2002, as sales were particularly strong at the Maui and Mission Hills resorts. There were no gains on sale of vacation ownership receivables during the first quarter of 2003 or 2002. The Company began construction of its fourth Westin-branded interval ownership resort in late 2002. The resort will feature 158 villas located adjacent to the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa in Scottsdale and pre-opening sales have begun.
Dispositions
The Company continues to review its worldwide portfolio for disposition candidates and is focused on restructuring and enhancing real estate returns and monetizing investments. During the first quarter, the Company entered into binding agreements to sell the Principe and the Sardinia Assets for 275 million Euro and 290 million Euro, respectively ($617 million combined based on exchange rates as of March 31, 2003). The Company expects to record a gain of approximately $130 million (after tax) upon closing of these sales. The Company plans to pay down debt with the net proceeds from these sales. The Company will continue to manage the Sardinia Assets after the sale is consummated under long term contracts and will participate through a 49% interest in future development of nearly 6,000 acres of land. The operating results of the Principe, together with interest expense related to debt that will be retired with the sales proceeds, have been classified as discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2003 and 2002. These transactions, which exceed the Company's initial goal of selling $500 million of assets by the end of 2003, are expected to close in mid-2003.
In April 2003, the Company approved a plan to sell the 18 Hotel Portfolio, the majority of which will be sold subject to management and/or franchise agreements. As a result, the Company classified these hotels as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $170 million (pre tax)
 
to reflect the current fair value of this portfolio. This impairment charge is roughly equal to the step-up of these assets recorded in connection with the merger with ITT Corporation in 1998. The Company expects to sign a definitive agreement in the coming months, and expects to close this sale in the second half of 2003.
Capital
During the first quarter of 2003, the Company invested approximately $22 million in hotel assets; $40 million in VOI capital assets, including VOI construction at Westin Mission Hills Resort Villas in Rancho Mirage, California, Sheraton's Mountain Vista in Avon, Colorado and Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas in Maui, Hawaii and the acquisition of land for the second phase of the Ka'anapali project; and $25 million in other development/corporate capital, including the ongoing development of the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco (269 rooms and 102 condominium units).
Financing
On March 31, 2003, the Company had total debt of $5.505 billion and cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of $304 million, or net debt of $5.201 billion, compared to net debt of $5.103 billion at the end of 2002. The debt balance at March 31, 2003 was unfavorably impacted, compared to year end 2002, by the annual dividend for 2002 of $170 million which was paid in January 2003 and approximately $37 million due to foreign currency translation, primarily due to the appreciation of the Euro. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company amended its credit facility related to its leverage covenant for that quarter. The Company expects that further amendments may be necessary but expects to obtain them.
At March 31, 2003, the Company's debt was approximately 54% fixed rate and 46% floating rate and its weighted average maturity was 5.8 years. As of March 31, 2003, the Company had cash (including restricted cash) and availability under its domestic and international revolving credit facilities of approximately $801 million and the Company's debt had a weighted average interest rate of 5.44%.
At March 31, 2003, Starwood had approximately 203 million shares outstanding (including partnership units and exchangeable preferred shares).
Dividend
On January 21, 2003, the company paid its annual dividend for 2002 of $0.84 per share to shareholders of record on December 31, 2002.
Special Items
The Company recorded net charges of $100 million (after-tax) for special items in the first quarter of 2003 when compared to a net benefit of $15 million (after-tax) in the same period of 2002.
The net charges in the first quarter of 2003 primarily represent an impairment charge relating to the 18 Hotel Portfolio to reflect their current fair value less selling costs due to the classification of these assets as held for sale, offset by benefits of $4 million related to
 
various adjustments to tax liabilities due to successful settlement of certain foreign and domestic tax matters.
The following represents a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations before special items to income (loss) from continuing operations after special items (in millions, except per share data):
 
Future Performance
All comments in the following paragraphs and certain comments in this release above are deemed to be forward-looking statements. These statements reflect expectations of the Company's performance given its current base of assets and its current understanding of external economic and political environments. Actual results may differ materially.
The situation in the Middle East, continued weakness in global economies, the outbreak of SARS and the threat of terrorist events and their consequent impact on travel make it extremely difficult to predict future results with any degree of precision. As a result, the Company is providing one possible scenario, rather than official guidance, to help the investment community gauge possible second quarter and full year financial results.
For the second quarter of 2003, after excluding results from the Principe under contract for sale and classified as a discontinued operation, if REVPAR at Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America was approximately 4% below the second quarter of 2002:
For the full year 2003, assuming the closings of the sales at the end of the second quarter of the Principe and Sardinia Assets currently under contract for sale and the 18 Hotel Portfolio, if REVPAR at Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America declined approximately 1-2% versus the full year 2002:
Starwood will be conducting a conference call to discuss the first quarter financial results at 10:30 a.m. (ET) today. The conference call will be available through simultaneous webcast in the Investor Relations/Press Releases section of the Company's website at www.starwood.com. A replay of the conference call will also be available from 1:30 p.m. (ET) today through 8:00 p.m. (ET) Tuesday, May 6, on both the Company's website and via telephone replay at 719-457-0820 (access code: 476110).
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings (losses) per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to Total Revenues, unless otherwise specified,
 
exclude other revenues from managed and franchised properties. EBITDA represents operating income before interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. All references to total Company EBITDA and EBITDA margins exclude other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties. The Company believes that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness and because such metric can be used to measure the Company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and pay cash distributions. EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and such metric should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding hotels under significant renovation or for which comparable results are not available. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
