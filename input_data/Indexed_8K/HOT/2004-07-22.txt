FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
JULY 22, 2004
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT):
WHITE PLAINS, NY, July 22, 2004
Second Quarter 2004 Highlights:
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2004 of $0.56 compared to $0.42 in the second quarter of 2003. Excluding special items, EPS from continuing operations was $0.50 for the second quarter of 2004 compared to $0.28 in the second quarter of 2003. Income from continuing operations was $120 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared to $87 million in 2003. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $107 million for the second quarter of 2004 compared to $57 million in 2003. Net income (including discontinued operations) was $154 million and EPS was $0.72 in the second quarter of 2004 compared to $290 million and EPS of $1.41 in the second quarter of 2003, which included a $193 million gain on the sale of the Hotel Principe di Savoia in Milan, Italy in June 2003. Selling, general, administrative and other in the second quarter of 2004 includes cost of sales from our new Bliss spa and beauty products business (the revenue from this business is included in management fees, franchise fees and other income) and an accrual, not payment, for Mr. Sternlicht's contractual separation payment. The normalized tax rate for the second quarter of 2004 and 2003 was 14.5% and 0%, respectively, excluding a $12 million net benefit in 2004 related to the reversal of a reserve as a result of a change in a Federal tax rule and a $24 million net benefit in 2003 resulting from the favorable settlement of certain tax matters.
Barry S. Sternlicht, Chairman and CEO, said "We are very pleased with our results this quarter and are increasingly excited by the significant momentum our company is building as the economic recovery strengthens and spreads globally. For the third quarter in a row we are delighted to be able to raise EPS and EBITDA guidance despite the industry leading revenue estimates we have provided each quarter going back nearly a year. Our new guidance suggests our EBITDA will increase nearly $200 million on a year-over-year basis, clearly the strongest EBITDA growth not only among lodging companies but among most any real estate company."
"While we expect REVPAR growth to slow as we pass the anniversary of the war, we remain confident in producing superior results well into 2006. We do so on the strength of many engines of growth. First, our brands continue to gain meaningful market share. Second, supply growth in our core markets remains very modest. Third, our development pipeline is the best in the company's history and is global. Our recent selection as the operator of the new 1,200 room Sheraton Phoenix convention center hotel, the new Ws in the Maldives, Scottsdale, Hoboken, and Europe's first W in Barcelona, along with the announcement of our 25th hotel in China, are the latest in the growing stream of important new external growth victories. Fourth, despite our success, we have maintained our focus on our cost structure and have made major progress in workers compensation and will launch a critical set of productivity initiatives that we are confident will lead to further expansion in margins beginning in the third quarter. Fifth, we have absorbed many unusual charges to our earnings this year that are not expected
 
to be repeated in 2005. Sixth, we are secure in the growth and rapid expansion of our vacation ownership group. Seventh, we are looking forward to the further recovery of the lagging European and Latin American markets where we own significant assets. Eighth, our accelerated expansion of our retail and spa businesses, led by Bliss, will add to our growth profile as they roll out around the world. Ninth, we are announcing today that we intend to sell an additional $500 million of assets over the next twelve months as we move aggressively in this climate to rationalize our portfolio. This is the next stage in our efforts to unlock the very significant real estate values in our asset base. Tenth, our strong balance sheet gives us enormous flexibility. With net debt of approximately $4.0 billion and expected proceeds from the sale of the St. Regis San Francisco condominiums in 2005 and the restructuring/resolution of the Le Meridien investment, all else being equal, our debt balance will fall significantly further. This flexibility affords us the opportunity to pursue high return investments and/or to continue the share repurchases we began to pursue more aggressively last quarter. Eleventh, we are making significant progress redeveloping our unique asset base. Finally, the commitment and passion of our management team and each and every associate will continue to drive the innovative Starwood culture."
Concluding, Mr. Sternlicht said, "With all this momentum, I am growing ever more confident that the EBITDA and earnings growth we're experiencing in 2004 can be repeated in 2005."

Definitions:
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" means gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory less cash inflows from the sale of inventory and receivables. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay income taxes and pay cash distributions. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e. "Adjusted EBITDA" and "Adjusted EBITDA excluding assets sold in 2003") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as the special items described on page 7 of this release and/or revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to recent guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA, however the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding hotels sold to date and under significant renovation or for which comparable results are not available. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
 
All references to contract sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made.
