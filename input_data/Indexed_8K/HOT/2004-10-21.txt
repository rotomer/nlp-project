FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT):
WHITE PLAINS, NY, October 21, 2004
Third Quarter 2004 Highlights:
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2004 of $0.49 compared to $0.23 in the third quarter of 2003. Excluding special items, which primarily relate to a $37 million (pre-tax) reversal of a reserve as a result of the favorable outcome of a litigation matter, EPS from continuing operations was $0.40 for the third quarter of 2004 compared to $0.24 in the third quarter of 2003. Income from continuing operations was $105 million in the third quarter of 2004 compared to $47 million in 2003. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $85 million for the third quarter of 2004 compared to $49 million in 2003. Net income (after discontinued operations) was $107 million and EPS was $0.50 in the third quarter of 2004 compared to $48 million and EPS of $0.23 in the third quarter of 2003. Selling, general, administrative and other in the third quarter of 2004 includes cost of sales from our new Bliss spa and beauty products business (the revenue from this business is included in management fees, franchise fees and other income). The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2004 was 19.5%.
Barry S. Sternlicht, Executive Chairman, said: "I am pleased with our industry leading results in the quarter, particularly at the property margin level and the 8.5% gain in average rates in North America. For the fourth quarter in a row, we are delighted to be able to raise our EBITDA and earnings guidance for the year once again. The travel markets, both group and transient, remain strong. We remain optimistic. On the strength of our six brands, our global development pipeline is gaining momentum. Starwood Vacation Ownership is producing superior results. Europe and Latin America are beginning to join Asia in the global rebound. Based on our confidence in this year and next, we repurchased significant stock in the quarter bringing total repurchases to $230 million year-to-date and through careful capital spending, were still able to pay down our debt at the same time. Our company's balance sheet is in its best shape ever."
"Entering 2005, our prospects remain bright, particularly given that several material one time costs absorbed in 2004 are unlikely to be repeated. Most importantly, I am excited by the arrival of our new CEO, Steve Heyer, who will take our great company to new places as he builds our team and our brands."
Steven J. Heyer, CEO, said "Clearly our brands, bolstered by our innovation leadership, have captured the imagination and loyalty of travelers around the globe. Two years of uninterrupted share gains are a tribute to Barry's leadership and our associate's dedication to excellence. And after just a short period of time here, I already see an excitement level and a passion for creating even greater shareholder value and marketplace strength. I look forward to working with Barry and the team to take our game to the next level."
Operating Results:
Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2004
 
Cash flow from operations was $195 million compared to $289 million in 2003. The decrease primarily relates to the increase in restricted cash from pre-sales of vacation ownership interests. Total Company Adjusted EBITDA was $291 million compared to $233 million in 2003.

Starwood Vacation Ownership
Vacation ownership revenue, which excludes gains on sales of notes receivable, was up $46 million, or 36% to $175 million in the third quarter of 2004 when compared to 2003 primarily due to sales at our resorts in Aspen, Maui, Orlando and Scottsdale.

The average price per timeshare unit sold increased approximately 7.9% to $20,049, and the number of contracts signed increased approximately 21.0% in the third quarter of 2004 when compared to 2003. In May 2004, the Company began selling fractional units at the St. Regis in Aspen, Colorado. The Company is in the process of converting 98 guest rooms at this hotel into 25 fractional units, which will be sold in four week intervals, and 20 new hotel rooms. The fractional project is expected to be completed towards the end of 2004. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company sold $25 million of notes receivable
 
and recognized a gain on sale of $3 million. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company did not have any sales of vacation ownership receivablesNew development planning continues for the owned Sheraton Kauai, the owned land at the Princeville resort in Kauai, the owned Sheraton Cancun, as well as other Mexico properties, and a second phase at the Westin Mission Hills Resort.

Definitions:
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" means gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory less cash inflows from the sale of inventory and receivables. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay income taxes and pay cash distributions. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e. "Adjusted EBITDA" and "Adjusted EBITDA excluding assets sold in 2003") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as the special items described on page 7 of this release and/or revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to recent guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA, however the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding hotels sold to date and under significant renovation or for which comparable results are not available. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
