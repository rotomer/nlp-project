FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 3, 2005
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT):
WHITE PLAINS, NY, February 3, 2005
Fourth Quarter 2004 Highlights:
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2004 of $0.51 compared to $0.42 in the fourth quarter of 2003. Excluding special items, primarily related to a $15 million (after-tax) net loss on the sale of assets and the impairment of a hotel and an investment, EPS from continuing operations was $0.57 for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $0.42 in the fourth quarter of 2003. Income from continuing operations was $111 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $88 million in 2003. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $123 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $87 million in 2003. Net income (after discontinued operations) was $100 million and EPS was $0.46 in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $87 million and EPS of $0.42 in the fourth quarter of 2003. Selling, general, administrative and other in the fourth quarter of 2004 includes cost of sales from our new Bliss spa and beauty products business (the revenue from this business is included in management fees, franchise fees and other income). The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 1.7%. The tax rate and thereby income from continuing operations benefited from the reversal of $13 million of tax reserves as a result of the resolution of certain tax matters during the quarter.
Steven J. Heyer, CEO, said: "I'm very pleased with our industry-leading top and bottom line performance. Clearly the top line was helped in part by our well-located urban concentration of owned assets, but it is just as clear that we are enjoying significant share gains versus our competitive set, beyond that explained by location, owing to the resurgence and effectiveness of our brands. The top line gains are broad based, throughout North America and around the world, and ADR increases were more than 70% of our REVPAR increase.
Flow-through increased markedly as a result of the strong ADR increases, our productivity initiatives and a turnaround in the workers compensation issues of last year. Workers comp incidents were down more than 30% in 2004 versus 2003.
Meanwhile, our brand composition, innovation, identity and positioning efforts continue as we work to increase their value. The strength, value and potential of our brands is something we must capitalize on in the future."
Operating Results:
Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2004
Cash flow from operations was $201 million compared to $260 million in 2003. The decrease primarily relates to the increase in restricted cash of $60 million primarily related to cash in escrow from pre-sales of vacation ownership interests. Total Company Adjusted EBITDA was $327 million compared to $271 million in 2003.
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
REVPAR for Same-Store Owned Hotels worldwide and in North America increased 11.1% and 11.0%, respectively, when compared to 2003. REVPAR at Same-Store
 
Owned Hotels in North America increased 11.7% at W, 11.4% at Sheraton, 10.8% at St. Regis/Luxury Collection, and 8.7% at Westin. REVPAR growth was particularly strong at the Company's owned hotels in New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Miami and Washington D.C. Revenue from transient travel was up 12.3% in North America when compared to 2003. Internationally, Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 11.6%, with Latin America up 24.3% (REVPAR in owned hotels in Argentina and Mexico were particularly strong), Europe up 9.1% and Asia Pacific up 4.1%. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign exchange, REVPAR increased 4.9% internationally.
Total revenues at Same-Store Owned Hotels worldwide increased 9.7%, to $867 million when compared to $790 million in 2003 while costs and expenses at the hotels increased 6.1% to $643 million in 2004 compared to $606 million in 2003. Total revenues at Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 8.7% to $631 million in 2004 when compared to $580 million in 2003 while costs and expenses at these hotels increased 3.4% to $464 million when compared to $449 million in 2003, resulting in increased margins of approximately 380 basis points.
System-wide REVPAR; Management/Franchise Fees
System-wide (owned, managed and franchised) branded REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels in North America increased 10.4%; Westin 11.8%, W Hotels 11.0%, Sheraton 9.7%, St. Regis/Luxury Collection 8.2%, and Four Points by Sheraton 8.9%. For the ninth quarter in a row, total Company market share in North America increased for the Company's owned and managed hotels as well as for system-wide hotels. Total third-party management and franchise fees were $80 million, up $7 million, or 9.2%, from last year.
Distribution
Starwood's central distribution systems gross bookings increased approximately 10% and 12% for the fourth quarter and full year 2004 when compared to the same periods in 2003. Gross online bookings through proprietary branded websites increased 29% in 2004 as compared to 2003, with gross dollar bookings from the proprietary branded sites increasing 38%. Gross online dollar bookings represented approximately 10% of the overall gross dollar bookings, with 72% of that coming from our proprietary branded websites.
Vacation Ownership and Residential
Vacation ownership and residential revenue, which excludes gains on sales of notes receivable, was up $85 million, or 75.9% to $197 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 when compared to 2003 primarily due to residential sales at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco and vacation ownership sales at our resorts in Aspen, Maui, Orlando and Scottsdale. Contract sales, excluding fractional sales at the St. Regis Aspen and residential sales at the St. Regis in San Francisco, were up 28.4%. The average price per timeshare unit sold increased approximately 3.9% to $20,447, and the number of contracts signed increased approximately 23.6% in the fourth quarter of 2004 when compared to 2003.
 
In December 2004, the Company completed the conversion of 98 guest rooms at the St. Regis in Aspen, Colorado into 25 fractional units, which are being sold in four week intervals, and 20 new hotel rooms. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company began selling condominiums at the St. Regis Museum Tower which is under construction in San Francisco, and recognized revenues of approximately $15 million.
In addition to its robust pipeline of existing vacation ownership inventory, the Company continues to evaluate its existing owned real estate for potential conversion to vacation ownership, fractional, or residential projects. The Company is also working with its business partners to develop similar conversion opportunities at managed hotels. The Company has identified a significant number of projects which could supply the vacation ownership and residential pipeline with sales at or above its current levels for at least ten years.
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company sold $25 million of notes receivable and recognized gains of $3 million as compared to gains of $9 million in the same period of 2003. New development planning continues for the owned Sheraton Kauai, the owned land at the Princeville resort in Kauai, the owned Sheraton Cancun, as well as other Mexico properties, and a second phase at the Westin Mission Hills Resort.
Brand Development/Unit Growth
During the fourth quarter, the Company signed 20 full service hotel management and franchise contracts (representing approximately 5,200 rooms) including the Westin Bellevue (Bellevue, Washington, 337 rooms), W LA Sunset (Los Angeles, California , 164 rooms), Sheraton Oran (Oran, Algeria, 321 rooms) and Sheraton Haikou Resort (China, 330 rooms), and opened 9 new hotels and resorts, including Sheraton Keauhou Bay Resort (Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, 521 rooms), Sheraton Read House Chattanooga Hotel (Chattanooga, Tennessee, 249 rooms), and Sheraton Old San Juan (San Juan, Puerto Rico, 240 rooms). Additionally during the fourth quarter 11 properties (representing approximately 2,800 rooms) were removed from the system (6 Four Points and 5 Sheratons.) The Company expects to open approximately 40 new full-service hotels and resorts (approximately 9,000 rooms) around the world in 2005. The Company had approximately 160 full service hotels and approximately 42,000 rooms in its active global development pipeline at December 31, 2004, with roughly half of that number in international locations. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, the Company opened the new Bliss spa at the W New York (20,000 square feet) and our first Remede Spa at the St. Regis in Aspen (15,000 square feet). In 2005, the Company plans to open 3 new Bliss spas in W hotels in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago and 2 new Remede Spas in St. Regis hotels in San Francisco and New York with several others in various planning stages.
Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004:
EPS from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $1.72 compared to $0.51 in the same period of 2003.

Cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $578 million compared to $771 million in the same period of 2003. The decrease primarily relates to the increase in restricted cash of $257 million, primarily related to pre-sales of vacation ownership interests. A substantial portion of this restricted cash will be released upon issuance of the certificate of occupancy for Phase 2 of the Westin Ka'anapali project which is expected to be received in the third quarter of 2005. Total Company Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $1.150 billion, compared to $917 million (excluding sold hotels) in the same period in 2003.
Capital:
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $81 million in renovations of hotel assets including construction capital at the St. Regis in Aspen, Colorado, the Boston Park Plaza, the Westin St. John, and the Sheraton Hotel and Towers in New York.

Additionally during the quarter, further investment spending of $44 million included the ongoing development of the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco (260 hotel rooms and 102 condominium units). To date, the Company has invested $221 million in the St. Regis Museum Tower project, which is expected to open in the summer of 2005. The Company expects to realize gross proceeds of approximately $200 million from the sale of the project's condominiums.

Outlook:
All comments in the following paragraphs and certain comments in this release above are deemed to be forward-looking statements. These statements reflect expectations of the Company's performance given its current base of assets and its current understanding of external economic and geo-political environments. Actual results may differ materially.
For the three months ended March 31, 2005, excluding the effects of the Share-Based Payment amendment to FASB Statement No. 123, if REVPAR at Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increases approximately 6%  8% versus the same period in 2004 (in January 2005 REVPAR at Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 9.5% when compared to the same period in 2004):
First quarter REVPAR is currently expected to increase less than full year 2005 REVPAR due primarily to the timing of the Easter and Passover holidays. In 2005 both holidays are in March, while in 2004 both holidays were in April.
For the full year 2005, excluding the effects of the Share-Based Payment amendment to FASB Statement No. 123, if REVPAR at Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increases approximately 8% - - 10% versus the full year 2004:
 
Special Items:
The Company recorded net charges of $12 million (after-tax) for special items in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $1 million of net benefit (after-tax) in the same period of 2003.
Special items in the fourth quarter of 2004 primarily relate to the net loss or impairment on hotels and an investment totaling $15 million (after-tax), offset in part by the $3 million reversal of tax reserves no longer deemed necessary.
The following represents a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before special items to income from continuing operation after special items (in millions, except per share data):

Definitions:
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" means gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay income taxes and pay cash distributions. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA" and "Adjusted EBITDA excluding assets sold in 2003") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as the special items described on page 7 of this release and/or revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also used Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to recent guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA; however, the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding hotels sold to date, and under significant renovation or for which comparable results are not available. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
