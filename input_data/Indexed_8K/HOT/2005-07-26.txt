FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 26, 2005
- Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT):
WHITE PLAINS, NY, July 26, 2005
Second Quarter 2005 Highlights:
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2005 of $0.65 compared to $0.56 in the second quarter of 2004. Excluding special items of $11 million (after-tax) in the 2005 period related to the partial demolition of the Sheraton in Cancun, Mexico where we will build vacation ownership units, EPS from continuing operations was $0.70 for the second quarter of 2005 compared to $0.50 in the second quarter of 2004. Income from continuing operations was $145 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $120 million in 2004. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $156 million for the second quarter of 2005 compared to $107 million in 2004. Net income (after discontinued operations) was $145 million and EPS was $0.65 in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $154 million and EPS of $0.72 in the second quarter of 2004. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2005 was 24.7%.
Steven J. Heyer, CEO, said: "Our results this quarter were outstanding and we are pleased to be raising our guidance for the remainder of the year. For the eleventh quarter in a row we've gained market share. I am thrilled with the progress we are making on our brand-building efforts and service innovation, which I believe will continue to keep us ahead of our competition and will accelerate our market share growth. The marketing and service programs we have and are developing will help us secure an emotional connection with our guests and cement our position as brand leader in the upper upscale and luxury segments."
"Our global development pipeline remains stronger than ever and new brand launches like Project XYZ should capture the lion's share of new select serve opportunities. The strength of our brands should also enable Starwood to capture share of wallet both inside and outside of the four walls of the hotel. Already, the Westin Heavenly Bed ensemble available at Nordstrom's, the Bliss catalogue business and the W Stores are adding to our top and bottom lines."
"During the quarter we announced several additional asset sales including the legendary Hotel Danieli in Venice, moving us in line to achieve our goal of $500
 
million in asset sales. We continue to evaluate our current portfolio of owned assets with a focus on harvesting previously unrecognized assets either through additional asset sales or redevelopment opportunities."
"Business continues to be robust and supply remains constrained. Our team is excited about the work we are doing and the direction we are heading."

Distribution
Starwood's central distribution systems gross bookings increased approximately 10% when compared to 2004. Gross online bookings through proprietary branded websites increased 30% as compared to 2004, with gross dollar bookings from the proprietary branded sites increasing 45%. Gross online dollar bookings represented approximately 12% of the overall gross dollar bookings, with 74% of that coming from our proprietary branded websites, as compared to 10% of overall gross dollar bookings, with 72% of that from proprietary branded websites in 2004.
Vacation Ownership and Residential
Vacation ownership and residential revenue, which excludes gains on sales of notes receivable (there were no sales of notes receivable in the second quarter of 2005), was up $93 million, or 66.4% to $233 million when compared to 2004 primarily due to residential sales at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco and vacation ownership sales at our resorts in Maui, Orlando and Scottsdale. Contract sales, excluding fractional sales at the St. Regis Aspen and residential sales at the St. Regis in San Francisco, were up 15.1% when compared to 2004. The average price per timeshare unit sold increased approximately 12.0% to $22,480, and the number of contracts signed increased approximately 2.7% when compared to 2004.
In December 2004, the Company completed the conversion of 98 guest rooms at the St. Regis in Aspen, Colorado into 25 fractional units, which are being sold in four week intervals, and 20 new hotel rooms. In the second quarter of 2005, the Company recognized revenues of $4 million related to this project. Also, in the second quarter of 2005, the Company continued selling condominiums at the St. Regis Museum Tower which is under construction in San Francisco, and recognized revenues of approximately $40 million.
In addition to its robust pipeline of existing vacation ownership inventory, the Company continues to evaluate its existing owned real estate for potential conversion to vacation ownership, fractional, or residential projects. For example, as discussed earlier, the Company has partially demolished the Sheraton in Cancun, Mexico where it will build a timeshare development that is expected to have up to 73 units upon completion. The Company is also working with its business partners to develop similar conversion opportunities at managed hotels.
Currently, the Company is working on new phases at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas in Maui, Hawaii, the Westin Kierland Villas in Scottsdale, Arizona, the Sheraton Broadway Plantation in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, the
 
Harborside Resort at Atlantis, Nassau, Bahamas, and the Sheraton Vistana Villages in Orlando, Florida.
In addition to the expansion at the existing properties above, Starwood Vacation Ownership is in the predevelopment phase of several new vacation ownership resorts including one in Princeville on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The Company is also working on its second St. Regis-branded fractional resort in Punta Mita, Mexico.
As discussed earlier, the Company did not sell any notes receivable and thereby did not recognize any gains during the second quarter of 2005 compared to gains of $8 million in the same period of 2004.
Brand Development/Unit Growth
During the second quarter, the Company signed 26 full service hotel management and franchise contracts (representing approximately 6,200 rooms) including the Westin Orlando Convention Center (Orlando, Florida, 492 rooms), Westin North Shore (Wheeling, Illinois, 440 rooms), Sheraton Urumqi (Urumqi, China, 410 rooms) and Westin Guangzhou (Guangzhou, China, 400 rooms) and opened nine new hotels and resorts, including the Sheraton Los Angeles Downtown Hotel (Los Angeles, California, 485 rooms) and Sheraton Miami Mart Hotel (Miami, Florida, 332 rooms). Nine properties (representing approximately 2,600 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter (5 Four Points and 4 Sheratons). Including openings during the first six months of 2005, the Company expects to open approximately 50 new full-service hotels and resorts (approximately 10,000 rooms) around the world in 2005. The Company had approximately 190 full service hotels and approximately 48,000 rooms in its active global development pipeline at June 30, 2005, with roughly half of that number in international locations.
In July 2005, the Company opened a new Bliss spa at the W San Francisco hotel. Later in 2005 and in 2006, the Company plans to open 3 new Bliss spas in W hotels in Dallas, Los Angeles and Chicago and 2 new Remede Spas in St. Regis hotels in San Francisco and New York with several others in various planning stages.

Definitions:
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay income taxes and pay cash distributions. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as the special items described on page 7 of this release and/or revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also used Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA; however, the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding hotels sold to date, undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not
 
available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality.) REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
