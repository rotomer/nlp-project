Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 26, 2005
 
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT):
WHITE PLAINS, NY, October 26, 2005
Third Quarter 2005 Highlights:
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 of $0.18 compared to $0.49 in the third quarter of 2004. Excluding special items of $91 million, which primarily relate to tax expense on the adoption of a plan to repatriate foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and additional tax expense related to the 1998 disposition of ITT World Directories, EPS from continuing operations was $0.58 for the third quarter of 2005 compared to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2004. Income from continuing operations was $40 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared to $105 million in 2004. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $131 million for the third quarter of 2005 compared to $85 million in 2004. Net income (after discontinued operations) was $39 million and EPS was $0.17 in the third quarter of 2005 compared to $107 million and EPS of $0.50 in the third quarter of 2004. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2005, including the two special tax items discussed above, was 72.3%.
Steven J. Heyer, CEO, said "Our Third Quarter performance was outstanding. Our operators remain committed to industry leading top line growth, while at the same time driving industry leading margin expansion through productivity initiatives. We remain focused on developing differentiated brand specific service excellence and emotional content. With strong brands comes significant opportunity to expand our footprint  particularly given that our brands are currently underrepresented versus our competitive set.
At the same time, we are working hard to unlock the inherent value of our owned real estate portfolio through aggressive portfolio management. We believe there will always be an important role for real estate if that real estate has significant upside development potential via timeshare, residential or repositioning.
 
Assets that do not fit our strategic criteria will be marketed for sale and we are in various stages of discussions with numerous interested parties. We expect that between today and twelve months from now we will likely enter into agreements for the sale of $2  $4 billion of assets. In most cases we expect to retain long term management or franchise contracts, maintaining our footprint while unlocking value for reinvestment in the business and for share repurchase  a core strategic principle.
Our core lodging businesses remain strong. The time is right to harvest previously unrecognized assets, build on our innovative culture, build world class brands, drive related growth and secure our position as the premier owned, management and franchise hotel and resort company."
Operating Results:
Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2005
Cash flow from operations was $588 million compared to $195 million in 2004. Total Company Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million compared to $291 million in 2004.
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
REVPAR for Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America and worldwide increased 13.2% and 11.9%, respectively, when compared to 2004. REVPAR at Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 24.5% at W, 21.6% at St. Regis/Luxury Collection, 10.8% at Sheraton, and 10.5% at Westin. REVPAR growth was particularly strong at the Company's owned hotels in New York, Seattle, Chicago, Los Angeles, Maui, Toronto, San Diego, San Francisco, and Atlanta. Revenue from transient travel was up 17.4% in North America when compared to 2004. Internationally, Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 8.4%, with Latin America up 18.2% (REVPAR in owned hotels in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and resort areas in Mexico was particularly strong), Europe up 6.9%, and Asia Pacific up 5.6%. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign exchange, REVPAR increased 6.4% internationally.
Total revenues at Same-Store Owned Hotels worldwide increased 10.3% to $848 million when compared to $769 million in 2004 while costs and expenses at the hotels increased 7.0% to $624 million in 2005 compared to $583 million in 2004. Total revenues at Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 10.9% to $613 million in 2005 when compared to $553 million in 2004 while costs and expenses at these hotels increased 7.4% to $454 million when compared to $423 million in 2004.
 
System-wide REVPAR; Management/Franchise Fees
System-wide (owned, managed and franchised) REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels in North America increased 11.7%; W Hotels 23.8%, St. Regis/Luxury Collection 18.2%, Sheraton 11.5%, Four Points by Sheraton 10.7%, and Westin 9.3%. For the twelfth quarter in a row, total Company market share in North America increased for the Company's owned and managed hotels as well as for system-wide hotels. Total third-party management and franchise fees were $91 million, up $9 million, or 11.4%, from last year.
Distribution
Starwood's central distribution systems gross bookings during the third quarter of 2005 increased approximately 7.7% when compared to 2004. Gross online bookings through proprietary branded websites increased 19.8% as compared to 2004, with gross dollar bookings from the proprietary branded sites increasing 32.3%. Gross online dollar bookings represented approximately 11.6% of the overall gross dollar bookings, with 76.1% of that coming from our proprietary branded websites, as compared to 10.3% of overall gross dollar bookings, with 73.3% of that from proprietary branded websites in 2004.
Vacation Ownership and Residential
Vacation ownership and residential revenue, which excludes gains on sales of notes receivable (there were no sales of notes receivable in the third quarter of 2005), was up $58 million, or 33.1% to $233 million when compared to 2004 primarily due to residential sales at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco. Vacation ownership sales increased at our resorts in Orlando, Scottsdale and Maui and decreased at our resort in Rancho Mirage, California, where substantially all of the available inventory has been sold. Contract sales, excluding fractional sales at the St. Regis Aspen and residential sales at the St. Regis in San Francisco, were up 14.4% when compared to 2004. The average price per timeshare unit sold increased approximately 7.7% to $21,595, and the number of contracts signed increased approximately 6.2% when compared to 2004.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Company continued selling condominiums at the St. Regis Museum Tower which is in the final stages of construction in San Francisco, and recognized revenues of approximately $57 million. This mixed-use project (hotel and residential) received a temporary certificate of occupancy earlier this month, and is expected to open in early November.
In addition to its robust pipeline of existing vacation ownership inventory, the Company continues to evaluate its existing owned real estate for potential conversion to vacation ownership, fractional, or residential projects. For example, the Company is converting two floors of the St. Regis hotel in New York into fractional units and has partially demolished the Sheraton in Cancun, Mexico
 
where it will build a timeshare development that is expected to have up to 73 units upon completion of the first phase. The Company is also working with its business partners to develop similar conversion opportunities at managed hotels.
Currently, the Company is working on new phases at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas in Maui, Hawaii, the Westin Kierland Villas in Scottsdale, Arizona, the Sheraton Broadway Plantation in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and the Sheraton Vistana Villages in Orlando, Florida.
In addition to the expansion at the existing properties above, Starwood Vacation Ownership is in the predevelopment phase of several new vacation ownership resorts including one in Princeville on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The Company is also working on a third St. Regis-branded fractional resort in Punta Mita, Mexico.
As mentioned earlier, the Company did not sell any notes receivable and thereby did not recognize any gains during the third quarter of 2005 compared to gains of $3 million in the same period of 2004.
Brand Development/Unit Growth
During the third quarter, the Company signed 17 hotel management and franchise contracts (representing approximately 4,000 rooms) including the Westin Paris (Paris, France, 438 rooms), Sheraton Maitland (Maitland, Florida, 396 rooms), Sheraton Carlsbad (Carlsbad, California, 350 rooms) and Four Points by Sheraton Shanghai Pudong (Shanghai, China, 340 rooms). Nine new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 1,500 rooms) entered the system, including the Sheraton Myrtle Beach Convention Center Hotel (Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, 402 rooms), and the Sheraton Oran Hotel & Towers (Oran, Algeria, 321 rooms). Ten properties (representing approximately 2,300 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter (4 Sheratons, 3 Four Points, 2 Luxury Collection and 1 unbranded). The Company had approximately 200 hotels and approximately 53,000 rooms in its active global development pipeline at September 30, 2005, with roughly half of that number in international locations.
In September 2005, the Company opened its second Remede Spa in the St. Regis hotel in New York, and in October 2005 opened a new Bliss spa, its sixth overall, in the W Lakeshore hotel in Chicago.
In the fourth quarter of 2005 and in 2006, the Company plans to open 2 new Bliss spas in W hotels in Dallas and Los Angeles, and a new Remede Spa in the St. Regis hotel in San Francisco with several others in various planning stages.

Investment spending on gross VOI inventory was $27 million, which was more than offset by cost of sales of $43 million tied to VOI sales during the quarter. The inventory spend included VOI construction at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas in Maui, Hawaii, the Sheraton Vistana Villages in Orlando, Florida, and the Westin Kierland Villas in Scottsdale, Arizona. Additionally during the quarter, further investment spending of $85 million included the ongoing development of the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco which will consist of 260 hotel rooms and 102 condominium units. Through September 30, 2005, the Company has invested $294 million in the St. Regis Museum Tower project, which, as discussed earlier, is expected to open in early November 2005.

Balance Sheet:
At September 30, 2005, the Company had total debt of $4.307 billion and cash and cash equivalents (including $262 million of restricted cash) of $1.171 billion, or net debt of $3.136 billion, compared to net debt of $3.460 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2005.

Definitions:
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay income taxes and pay cash distributions. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as the special items described on page 9 of this release and/or revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also used Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA; however, the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The
 
Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding hotels sold to date, undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or hurricane damage.) REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
