Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 14, 2005, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Starwood"), Starwood Hotels & Resorts, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("Starwood Trust"), and certain subsidiaries of Starwood and Starwood Trust (collectively, the "Starwood Parties") entered into a definitive master agreement and plan of merger (the "Master Agreement") with Host Marriott Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("Host"), and its wholly owned operating subsidiary, Host Marriott, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Host OP" and, together with Host, the "Host Parties"), pursuant to which Host will acquire certain entities and assets that collectively own 25 domestic hotels and 13 foreign hotels from the Starwood Parties. The Master Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) the internal restructuring of the Starwood Parties and the Host Parties and their respective subsidiaries, including the de-pairing of the "paired shares" of Starwood and Starwood Trust ("Paired Shares"), (ii) the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Host OP with and into Starwood Trust (the "REIT Merger") and (iii) the acquisition by Host OP of other hotels and assets not owned by Starwood Trust through the acquisition of equity interests, assets or other rights (collectively, the "Closing Transactions").
The total consideration payable in the Closing Transactions (excluding transaction expenses that will be incurred in connection therewith) will be approximately $4.1 billion, consisting of $1.063 billion in cash, and the assumption of $704 million in debt and approximately 133,529,412 shares of Host Common Stock.
At the effective time and as a result of the REIT Merger (based upon the capitalization of Starwood Trust at September 30, 2005) (i) each (1) Class B share, par value $0.01 per share ("Class B Share"), of Starwood Trust and (2) Class A Exchangeable Preferred Share, par value of $0.01 per share ("Class A EPS"), of Starwood Trust issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the REIT Merger will be converted into and become exchangeable for 0.6122 shares of Host common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Host Common Stock"), and $0.503 in cash from Host and (ii) the Class A shares, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A Shares"), of Starwood Trust issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the REIT Merger will be converted into and become exchangeable for an aggregate of $16,491,237 in cash from Host, subject to adjustment by, among other things, (A) the amount of working capital at closing, (B) changes in the amount of assumed indebtedness, (C) the agreed value of any hotels that are removed from the Closing Transactions prior to closing, (D) certain capital expenditures and (E) the amount of any Host quarterly cash dividends above $0.15 per share of Host Common Stock and, in the event there is a certain reduction in the outstanding number of Paired Shares during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and closing, the remaining shares of Host Common Stock not otherwise issued in the REIT Merger. As of September 30, 2005, 100 Class A Shares were outstanding and held by Starwood, approximately 219,272,686 Class B Shares were outstanding and 562,222 Class A EPS were outstanding.
The exchange of shares in the REIT Merger as contemplated by the Master Agreement is expected to be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The Host Parties and the Starwood Parties have made certain representations, warranties and covenants in the Master Agreement, including, among others, covenants (i) subject to certain exceptions, to preserve intact their respective business organizations and goodwill during the interim period between the execution of the Master Agreement and closing, (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period, (iii) to cause a stockholder meeting to be held by Host to consider approval of the issuance of Host Common Stock in the Closing Transactions and (iv) that the Host Board of Directors will recommend such approval to its stockholders. In addition, the Starwood Parties have made certain additional customary covenants, including, among others, covenants not to (i) conduct the operations of the hotels to be acquired by Host other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) subject to certain limited exceptions to permit the Board of Trustees of Starwood Trust to comply with its fiduciary duties, solicit, negotiate, provide information in furtherance of, approve, recommend or enter into alternative business combination transactions. Certain indemnities are provided by the parties to each other.
Consummation of the Closing Transactions is subject to customary conditions, including, among others, (i) approvals by the stockholders of Host, (ii) absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Closing Transactions, (iii) approvals by antitrust and competition authorities in certain countries, (iv) the registration statement of Host filed on Form S-4 becoming effective and (v) shares of Host Common Stock being approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, each party's obligation to consummate the Closing Transactions is subject to certain other conditions, including, among others, (i) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to the business of the other party, (iii) material
Table of Contents
compliance of the other party with its covenants and (iv) the delivery of opinions from tax counsel to Host and Starwood Trust regarding certain REIT qualification matters. Pending satisfaction of closing conditions as to certain properties, their acquisition may be deferred to subsequent closings.
The Master Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Host Parties and the Starwood Parties, and further provides that, upon termination of the Master Agreement under specified circumstances, Starwood would be required to pay a termination fee of $100 million, plus up to $20 million in expenses.
The Master Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

None of the Horizon SEC Documents, at the time of filing or, as applicable, of becoming effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (b) Each of Horizon and Horizon OP has been and is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. No officer or director of Horizon is currently indebted to Horizon or Horizon OP.
          (c) Each of Horizon and Horizon OP has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to it and its consolidated Subsidiaries is made known to the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of it (or, in the case of Horizon OP, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Horizon, as its sole general partner) by others within those entities. The principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Horizon (including in their capacities as officers of the sole general partner of Horizon OP) have made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange
 
Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.
          (d) Horizon has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP (within the meaning of such terms under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). Horizon has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation to its respective auditors and the audit committee of Horizon's Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Horizon's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial reporting. Horizon has delivered to Sun any such disclosures (i) prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) with respect to evaluations after the date of this Agreement, promptly following the disclosures to the applicable auditors and audit committee.

Except as disclosed in of the Horizon Disclosure Letter, since December 31, 2004 (the ""), Horizon and Horizon OP have conducted their business in the Ordinary Course and there has not been (a) any circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Horizon Material Adverse Effect or (b) on or prior to the date of this Agreement, any other action or omission by Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary which, if occurring during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing, would constitute a breach of any of the following subsections of : , and, with respect to any of the foregoing, .

Taxes
          (a) Each of the Horizon Parties and each member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any Horizon Party or any Horizon Subsidiary is or was a member (each such entity, a "") (A) has filed (or has had filed on its behalf) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so) and all such Tax Returns are accurate and complete in all material respects; (B) has paid (or Horizon has paid on its behalf) all material Taxes of it (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) that are due and payable; and (C) has complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3121, and 3402 of the Code or any similar provision of any other Law) and has, within the time period prescribed by Law, withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Entities all material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable Laws. The most recent audited financial statements of Horizon contained in the Horizon SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) for all material unpaid Taxes of the Horizon Taxpayers for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Since the Horizon Financial Statement Date, no Horizon Taxpayer
Horizon Taxpayer
 
has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the Ordinary Course. Since January 1, 1999, Horizon has not incurred any material liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. No Horizon Taxpayer is the subject of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of material Taxes, and to the Knowledge of Horizon, no audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of material Taxes involving any Horizon Taxpayer is being considered by any Tax authority. No deficiencies for any material Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against any Horizon Taxpayer that have not been resolved, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending. No Horizon Taxpayer has received written notice from any Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction in which such entity does not file a Tax Return stating that such entity is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.
          (b) Since January 1, 1999, Horizon (i) has elected to be subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code (and any similar provision of state Tax Law) and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for all taxable years since and including 1999, (ii) has operated since, and intends to continue to operate on or before the Closing Date, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT and (iii) has received no written notice that a challenge to its status as a REIT is pending or threatened. Each Horizon Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has been treated since its formation and continues to be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as a partnership or as an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. In addition, each Horizon Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has not since the latest of January 1, 1999, its formation or the acquisition by Horizon of a direct or indirect interest therein, owned any Assets (including securities) that would cause Horizon to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code, unless any such Asset was disposed of prior to the last day of the calendar quarter in which it was acquired or within the applicable cure period provided for in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Horizon OP is not a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is taxable as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704(a) of the Code. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1999 and ending on or before December 31, 2000, each Horizon Subsidiary which is a corporation (for federal income tax purposes) has been on the last day of each calendar quarter during which Horizon has owned an interest in such corporation representing more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such corporation, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, each Horizon Subsidiary which is a corporation (for federal income tax purposes) has been, on the last day of each calendar quarter during which Horizon has owned an interest in such corporation representing more than 10% of the value of the outstanding securities of such corporation or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such corporation, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code, a taxable REIT subsidiary of Horizon under Section 856(l) of the Code, a REIT, or a corporation which qualifies under the transitional rules set forth in Section 546(b) of the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999. Each Horizon Subsidiary that is a "qualified REIT subsidiary" under Section 856(i) of the Code is set forth in of the Horizon Disclosure Letter.
Section 4.8(b)
          (c) To the Knowledge of Horizon, as of the date hereof, Horizon is a "domestically-controlled" REIT within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the Code.
 
          (d) There are no Encumbrances for material Taxes (other than current Taxes not yet due and payable) on the assets of any Horizon Taxpayer.
          (e) No Horizon Taxpayer, or any predecessors of such entity by merger or consolidation, has within the past three (3) years been a party to a transaction intended to qualify under Section 355 of the Code or under so much of Section 356 of the Code as it relates to Section 355 of the Code.
     Section 4.9 . Except for Goldman Sachs & Co. (""), whose fees are solely payable by Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Horizon Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary.

     Section 4.10 . Except as disclosed in of the Horizon Disclosure Letter, there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Horizon, threatened against or affecting Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary directly relating to or involving any of their respective Assets, or any of the directors, officers, employees or agents thereof who may be subject to indemnification by Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate, if determined or resolved adversely, would reasonably be expected to (i) have, or has had, a Horizon Material Adverse Effect or (ii) prevent or materially impair the ability of any Horizon Party to perform any of its respective obligations hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement or prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the Horizon Transactions, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary that has had or would reasonably be expected to have any such effect.
Litigation
Section 4.10
     Section 4.11 . Horizon has received the opinion of GS&Co., its financial advisor, which has not been withdrawn or otherwise modified, to the effect that as of the date of this Agreement, based upon and subject to the matters set forth in such opinion, the Consideration (as such term is defined in such opinion) in the aggregate to be paid by Horizon and certain of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to Horizon.

The affirmative vote with respect to the issuance of the shares of Horizon Common Stock in the Closing Transactions, of a majority of the votes cast by holders of shares of Horizon Common Stock; that, the total vote cast represents over 50% of the Horizon Common Stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote, is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock or equity interest of any Horizon Party necessary or required to adopt or approve this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the Horizon Transactions, except for the approval of (x) Horizon OP, as the sole member of REIT Merger Sub, and (y) REIT Merger Sub, as the general partner of SLT Merger Sub.

          (b) All of the outstanding membership interests of REIT Merger Sub are owned directly by Horizon OP. All of the outstanding limited partnership interests of SLT Merger Sub are owned by REIT Merger Sub, its general partner, and Horizon OP. There are no options, warrants or other rights (including registration rights), agreements, arrangements or commitments to which either REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub is a party of any character relating to the issued or unissued membership interests of, or other equity interests in, REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub, respectively, or obligating REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub, respectively, to grant, issue or sell any membership interests of, or other equity interests in, REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub, respectively, by sale, lease, license or otherwise.

Horizon and the Horizon Subsidiaries own and/or possess all Permits which are required for the businesses, activities and operations of their business, except where the absence of such Permits, individually and in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Horizon Material Adverse Effect. Horizon and each Horizon Subsidiary has been in compliance in all respects with the terms of its Permits, except for such instances of non-compliance which have been cured or which, individually and in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Horizon Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are in full force and effect and neither Horizon nor any Horizon Subsidiary has received notice that any suspension, modification or revocation of any of them is pending or, to the Knowledge of Horizon, threatened nor, to the Knowledge of Horizon, do any grounds exist for any such action, except for such suspensions, modifications or revocations that, individually and in the

 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT) ("Starwood") today announced a definitive agreement under which Host Marriott Corporation (NYSE: HMT) ("Host") will acquire 38 properties from Starwood  including hotels under the Sheraton, W, Westin, St. Regis and Luxury Collection brands  in a stock-and-cash transaction valued at approximately $4.1 billion, including debt assumption. As part of the agreement, Starwood will generally continue to manage the properties under their current flags for up to 40 years. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the proposed transaction.
WHITE PLAINS, NY, NOVEMBER 14, 2005
THE PORTFOLIO: Host is acquiring 38 hotels, including 20 Sheratons, 13 Westins, one St. Regis, two W's, one Luxury Collection and one non-branded hotel. The portfolio includes 28 hotels in North America, six hotels in Europe and two each in Asia and Latin America. Total rooms in the portfolio are 18,964. Total EBITDA pre-management fees for total year 2005 for the portfolio are expected to be approximately $376 million, and $315 million post-management fees. Therefore, Host will be acquiring approximately $315 million in EBITDA. 54% of the post fee EBITDA in the portfolio is derived from Sheraton, 35% from Westin with the remainder coming from the other brands. 81% of post fee EBITDA is from North American hotels. A list of properties is provided below.
CONSIDERATION: Host will be paying $4,096 million in cash and stock based on Host's closing stock price on Friday, November 11 of $17.44. $2,329 million or 57% will be in the form of 133.5 million shares of Host stock which will be distributed directly to Starwood holders of record at closing. $1,767 million will be in the form of cash and assumed debt including $104 million in property specific debt and, subject to bondholder consent, approximately $600 million in Sheraton Holding Corp. debt. The remaining $1,063 million will be paid in cash to both Starwood and its shareholders.
th
Under the terms of the sale, a subsidiary of Host will be acquiring, among other assets, all the stock of Starwood's real estate investment trust in a transaction that will be taxable to shareholders. In this transaction, Starwood's shareholders will receive $11.18 in value for each share of class B stock they own (based on Host's Friday closing price). This consideration will be in the form of 0.6122 shares of Host stock and 50.3 cents in cash for each Class B share. As a result $2,451 million in cash
 
and stock proceeds from the transaction, or 60% of total proceeds, will flow directly to Starwood shareholders. Starwood will receive $941 million in cash and transfer $704 million in debt to Host.
The $11.18 of value that the Class B shareholders will receive on a per share basis will represent taxable proceeds on the exchange of their Class B shares and will be offset by the shareholder's cost basis in the Class B shares producing a net capital gain or loss on the transaction. Starwood will provide information to the shareholders that will assist them in the determination of the amount of the tax basis in their paired shares that is attributable to their Class B shares.
CONTRACT: The hotels sold will generally be encumbered by license and management agreements with a 20 year initial term and two 10 year extension options exercisable at Starwood's discretion. The license agreement defines Starwood's rights and obligations as a brand owner and pays a license fee of 5% of Gross Room Revenue and 2% of Food and Beverage revenue. The management agreement defines Starwood's rights and obligations as a manager and pays 1% of Gross Operating Revenue and Incentive fee which is a share of profits in excess of a return on the owner's investment. This unique structure provides enhanced influence to ensure continued brand innovation, quality and consistent and differentiated guest service experience. Under the agreements to be entered into with Host total fees for the portfolio in 2005 would have been $61 million.
Starwood and Host are committed to working together to add maximum value to this portfolio and find additional opportunities to leverage their mutual strengths going forward.
OTHER TERMS: Starwood expects minimal corporate income tax expense from the transaction. There will be the usual transaction costs including transfer taxes, consent costs, banking and legal fees.
PROFORMA IMPACT: The effect of the acquisition on Starwood's 2006 results will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the timing of the transaction. The closing is not expected to occur until near the end of the first quarter of 2006. Further, the closing of some or all of the properties may not occur, or could be deferred until a later time, depending on various circumstances. However, for purposes of estimating a full-year impact to Starwood's results, a January 1, 2006 closing date for all of the properties in the portfolio was assumed. Further, assuming the REVPAR and other operating parameters underlying the guidance included in the company's Third Quarter Earnings Press Release are unchanged and assuming (i) no other asset sales (including those previously announced), (ii) the amortization of the gain on the sale of the Host portfolio, and (iii) a tax rate of 35%, we expect post transaction 2006 EBITDA to be approximately $1.250 billion and post transaction EPS to be $2.14 (based on 226.5 million shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis).
Steven J. Heyer, Starwood Chief Executive Officer, said: "This transaction puts a strategic stake in the ground, accelerating Starwood's transformation from a real estate company with some
 
hotel brands to a consumer lifestyle company with a branded hotel portfolio at its core. This well timed sale commits Starwood to an asset right' strategy, shifting our revenue and profit mix to place greater emphasis on successfully developing and leveraging our renowned brands. As a result, Starwood will be increasingly focused on driving top line growth and profitability through marketing, branding, development and, above all, providing superior experiences to our guests. At the same time, we will benefit from having Host, an extremely high-quality company with a solid leadership team, as our long-term partner."
Mr. Heyer continued: "This transaction enables us to orient the Company toward fee-based revenues and profits, while gaining additional resources to increase investment in our hotel brands, Starwood Vacation Ownership properties, new category-killer initiatives, such as in the select serve market and developing a by Westin'extended stay product, as well as international growth. In addition, it provides increased opportunity to use our hotel network as a powerful distribution channel for related products and services, such as Bliss and the Heavenly Bed. The sale will increase Starwood's growth rates and return on capital, diminish the impact of cyclical fluctuations in the real estate market on our business, reduce overhead costs and strengthen our balance sheet to fund further expansion and allow us to return value to our shareholders."
aloft
Following the close of this transaction and other transactions previously signed or closed, Starwood will continue to own 93 properties with 28,432 rooms that produce more than $500 million in annualized EBITDA.
Mr. Heyer said: "Even after this significant transaction, Starwood will remain, and intends to remain, one of the largest owners of hotel and vacation properties. This remaining portfolio will include properties that serve to facilitate innovation speed and proof of concept for our system, support our vacation ownership business and provide significant upside potential through re-branding or redevelopment. We will seek new opportunities to maximize our return on invested capital through continued effective management of our assets and the continued purchase and churn of hotel real estate as opportunities emerge."
The transaction is subject to the approval of Host Marriott shareholders and to customary closing conditions, including necessary regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2006.
Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.and Deutsche Bank AG. acted as financial advisors and Sidley Austin Brown and Wood LLP served as lead legal counsel to Starwood. Goldman Sachs served as financial advisor and Latham & Watkins and Hogan & Hartson LLP served as legal counsel to Host Marriott.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay income taxes and pay cash distributions. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors.
