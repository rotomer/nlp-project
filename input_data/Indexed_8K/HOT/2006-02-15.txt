Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as Lead Arrangers and Book Running Managers, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Citicorp North America, Inc., and the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, as Senior Managing Agents and Nizvho Corporate Bank, Ltd. as Managing Agent entered into a Credit Agreement (""). The Credit Agreement is a five-year $1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility, which replaces the existing $1.45 billion Credit Agreement dated October 9, 2002 (the "") that would have matured in October 2006. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving loans and the issuance of letters of credit to Starwood and certain of its subsidiaries of up to $150 million in Euros (available to Starwood Italia S.R.L. only) and $350 million in Euros (available to other Starwood subsidiaries), $250 million in Pounds Sterling, $100 million in Australian dollars, $100 million in Yen, $25 million in Canadian dollars and $100 million of other permitted Libor based currencies other than dollars, with an overall limit on outstanding loans in currencies other than dollars of $500 million.
Trust
Credit Agreement
2002 Credit Facility
     Each domestic Borrower and Sheraton Holding Corporation have also issued loan guarantees. The Sheraton Holding Corporation guaranty as well as the obligations of the Trust will be terminated upon the acquisition of those entities by Host Marriott Corporation. Interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility are based on LIBOR interest periods selected by the Borrower at the time of any advance and the rates vary depending upon Starwood's leverage ratio (calculated as a ratio of funded debt versus EBITDA for the previous four quarters) or credit rating, with rates ranging as low as LIBOR plus 0.4% and up to a maximum of LIBOR plus 0.8%. The Borrowers may prepay the outstanding aggregate principal amount, in whole or in part, at any time, subject to certain restrictions. The Credit Agreement also includes customary mandatory prepayment provisions which are triggered when certain events occur, for example, the Company inadvertently exceeding the sub-commitment limits for any currency. The Credit Agreement and related documents contain customary financial covenants and default provisions.
     This new credit facility replaces the 2002 Credit Facility which has now been terminated. All letters of credit outstanding and all outstanding obligations under the 2002 Credit Facility were terminated and replaced or rolled into and became obligations under the Credit Agreement as of the closing date.
     A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On February 10, 2006, in conjunction with the entrance into the new Credit Agreement, that certain 2002 Credit Facility, dated October 9, 2002, among Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., certain additional Alternate Currency Revolving Loan Borrowers, various Lenders, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Syndication Agent, Bank of America, N.A., Fleet National Bank and Societe Generale, as Co-Documentation Agents, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as Co-Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Running Managers, was terminated.

     The information contained in Item 1.01 concerning the Company's direct financial obligations is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender.

It is understood that the amount of funds delivered by each RL Lender shall be calculated on a net basis, giving effect to both the sales and purchases of participations by the various RL Lenders as required above.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the failure of any RL Lender to purchase its participating interests in any extensions of credit upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event shall not relieve any other RL Lender of its obligation hereunder to purchase its participating interests in a timely manner, but no RL Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other RL Lender to purchase the participating interest to be purchased by such other RL Lender on any date.
          (e) If any amount required to be paid by any RL Lender pursuant to Section 1.17(c) is not paid to the Administrative Agent within one Business Day following the date upon which such RL Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent of the amount of its participations required to be purchased pursuant to said Section 1.17(c), such RL Lender shall also pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount so required to be paid by such RL Lender for the purchase of its participations (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate, during the period from and including the date of request for payment to but excluding the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Administrative Agent (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any RL Lender pursuant to Section 1.17(c) is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent within three Business Days following the date upon which such RL Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of participations required to be purchased by it, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover from such RL Lender on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such request date at the rate per annum applicable to Dollar Revolving Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans hereunder. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any RL Lender with respect to any amounts payable under this Section 1.17 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Amounts payable by any RL Lender pursuant to this Section 1.17 shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant RL Lenders; that, if the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion) has elected to fund on behalf of such RL Lender the amounts owing to such RL Lenders, then the amounts shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for its own account.

DRL Borrower Guaranty
          14.01 . In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder and to induce the Lenders or any of their respective Affiliates to enter into Interest Rate Protection Agreements or Other Hedging Agreements, and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by each DRLB Guarantor from the proceeds of the Loans, the issuance of the Letters of Credit and the entering into of Interest Rate Protection Agreements or Other Hedging Agreements, each DRLB Guarantor hereby agrees with the Lenders as follows: each DRLB Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of any and all of its Relevant Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors. If any or all of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of any DRLB Guarantor to the Guaranteed Creditors becomes due and payable hereunder, each DRLB Guarantor unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, together with any and all expenses which may be incurred by the Guaranteed Creditors in collecting any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. This DRL Borrower Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. This DRL Borrower Guaranty is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. If claim is ever made upon any
The Guaranty
 
Guaranteed Creditor for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and any of the aforesaid payees repays all or part of said amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such payee or any of its property or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such payee with any such claimant (including any Relevant Guaranteed Party), then and in such event the respective DRLB Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon such DRLB Guarantor, notwithstanding any revocation of this DRL Borrower Guaranty or any other instrument evidencing any liability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, and each DRLB Guarantor shall be and remain liable to the aforesaid payees hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by any such payee.
          14.02 . Additionally, each DRLB Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the payment of any and all of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors whether or not due or payable by any Relevant Guaranteed Party upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 10.05, and unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand.
Bankruptcy
          14.03 . The liability of each DRLB Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any guaranty of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations whether executed by such DRLB Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and the liability of each DRLB Guarantor hereunder is not affected or impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by any Relevant Guaranteed Party, or (e) any payment made to the Guaranteed Creditors on the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations which any such Guaranteed Creditor repays to any Relevant Guaranteed Party pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each DRLB Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding, or (f) any action or inaction of the type described in Section 14.05, or (g) the lack of validity or enforceability of any Credit Document or any other instrument relating thereto.
Nature of Liability
          14.04 . No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations shall affect, impair or be a defense to this DRL Borrower Guaranty, and this DRL Borrower Guaranty shall be primary, absolute and unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or the existence of any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or a defense available to, a surety or guarantor except indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each DRLB Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against any DRLB Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party and whether or not any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party
Independent Obligation
 
be joined in any such action or actions. Each DRLB Guarantor waives, to the full extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any payment by any Relevant Guaranteed Party or other circumstance that operates to toll any statute of limitations as to such Relevant Guaranteed Party shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to the relevant DRLB Guarantor.
          14.05 . Each DRLB Guarantor authorizes the Guaranteed Creditors without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to:
Authorization
     (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the rate of interest thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this DRLB Guarantor Guaranty shall apply to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed, increased or altered;
     (b) take and hold security for the payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset thereagainst;
     (c) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting;
     (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, any Relevant Guaranteed Party or other obligors;
     (e) settle or compromise any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, any security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to their respective creditors other than the Guaranteed Creditors;
     (f) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liability or liabilities of such Relevant Guaranteed Party remain unpaid;
     (g) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Interest Rate Protection Agreement or Other Hedging Agreement or any of the instruments or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Interest Rate Protection Agreement or Other Hedging Agreement or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or
 
     (h) take any other action that would, under otherwise applicable principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of, or a defense available to, such DRLB Guarantor from its liabilities under this DRL Borrower Guaranty.
          14.06 . It is not necessary for the Guaranteed Creditors to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Relevant Guaranteed Party or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any Relevant Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
Reliance
          14.07 . Any of the indebtedness of any Relevant Guaranteed Party now or hereafter owing to any DRLB Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of such Relevant Guaranteed Party owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of such Relevant Guaranteed Party to such DRLB Guarantor shall be collected, enforced and received by such DRLB Guarantor in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of such Relevant Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of any DRLB Guarantor under the other provisions of this DRL Borrower Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by any DRLB Guarantor of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any of the indebtedness of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to such DRLB Guarantor, such DRLB Guarantor shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each DRLB Guarantor hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this DRL Borrower Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.
Subordination
          14.08 . (a) Each DRLB Guarantor waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any other Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor's power whatsoever. Each DRLB Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, other than indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, based on or arising out of the disability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party other than indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any DRLB Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Each DRLB Guarantor
Waiver
 
waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such DRLB Guarantor against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party or any security.
          (b) Each DRLB Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this DRL Borrower Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. Each DRLB Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Relevant Guaranteed Party's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such DRLB Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Guaranteed Creditors shall have no duty to advise any DRLB Guarantor of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks.
          (c) Until such time as the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash, each DRLB Guarantor hereby waives all rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this DRL Borrower Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Guaranteed Creditors against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this DRL Borrower Guaranty.
          (d) Each DRLB Guarantor warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law.
          14.09 . All payments made by a DRLB Guarantor pursuant to this Section 14 shall be made in the respective Applicable Currency in which the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations are then due and payable (giving effect, in the circumstances contemplated by Section 1.17, to any conversion occurring pursuant thereto). All payments made by a DRLB Guarantor pursuant to this Section 14 will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 4.03, 4.04 and 13.16.
Payments
          14.10 . Each DLRB Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement various Dollar Revolving Loan Borrowers and Alternate Currency Revolving Loan Borrowers may become party to the Credit Agreement from time to time and incur Loans and other Obligations thereunder and (ii) all Obligations of each Dollar Revolving Loan Borrower and each Alternate Currency Revolving Loan Borrower under the Credit Agreement shall be fully guaranteed hereunder (and constitute Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of such DLRB Guarantor) and no consent of such DLRB Guarantor shall be required to effect the same.
Consent to Additional Obligations
 
          14.11 . Each DLRB Guarantor (other than the Corporation) hereby confirms that it is its intention that this DRL Borrower Guaranty not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any similar Federal, state or foreign law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each DLRB Guarantor (other than the Corporation) hereby irrevocably agrees that its Relevant Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of such DLRB Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, result in its Relevant Guaranteed Obligations in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance; it being understood that in no event shall the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of the Corporation be limited pursuant to the provisions of this Section 14.10 as the Corporation is the direct or indirect parent of each of the other DRLB Guarantors and, accordingly, is obtaining direct benefits from all extensions of credit to the DLRB Guarantors. Any limitation on the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of any DLRB Guarantor resulting from the application of the provisions of this Section 14.10 shall have no effect on the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of any other DLRB Guarantor or the Obligations of any other Credit Party (under its Guaranty), which (in each case) shall be determined as if there were no such limitation, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
Fraudulent Conveyance Limitation
 
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused their duly authorized officers to execute and deliver this Agreement as of the date first above written.
