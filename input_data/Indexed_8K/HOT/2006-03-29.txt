Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 24, 2006, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Master Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 14, 2005, among the Company, Host Marriott Corporation ("Host") and the other parties thereto. Pursuant to the amendment to the agreement, among other things, (i) the three hotels in Canada will not be included in the transaction, (ii) the $600 million of senior notes issued by Sheraton Holding Corporation will not be assumed by Host but will be assumed by the Company, and (iii) the closing of certain hotels in Europe will be deferred. As a result of the exclusion of the Canadian hotels, the overall purchase price for the transaction has been reduced by approximately $276 million. The adjustment will be made to the cash portion of the transaction consideration paid to the Company. As a result of the assumption of the senior noted by Starwood, the cash portion of the purchase price will be increased by $600 million . The closing of five of the hotels included in the transaction located in Europe will be deferred and will not be included in the initial closing of the transaction. The acquisition of four of the hotels is expected to occur as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of the conditions to closing. It is expected that four of the hotels will close in May 2006 and the acquisition of the fifth hotel, The Westin Europa & Regina in Venice, Italy, is expected to occur in June 2006. A copy of the Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
