FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 26, 2006
 
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT):
WHITE PLAINS, NY, October 26, 2006
Third Quarter 2006 Highlights
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2006 of $0.71 compared to $0.18 in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding special items, EPS from continuing operations was $0.68 for the third quarter of 2006 compared to $0.58 in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2006 was 21.2%. The effective tax rate includes benefits realized in connection with the sales of several hotels in unconsolidated joint ventures.
Income from continuing operations was $155 million in the third quarter of 2006 compared to $40 million in 2005. Excluding special items, which net to a $7 million benefit in 2006, income from continuing operations was $148 million for the third quarter of 2006 compared to $131 million in 2005.
Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2006 as compared to 2005 was impacted by four major items:
Net income was $155 million and EPS was $0.71 in the third quarter of 2006 compared to net income of $39 million and EPS of $0.17 in the third quarter of 2005.
Steven J. Heyer, CEO, said, "I am extremely pleased with our results for the third quarter. All of our business units are performing on all cylinders and we expect this strength to continue into 2007 and beyond.
 
Systemwide REVPAR increased 9.2% in the quarter, with strength across all our brands. At our owned hotels, North America branded REVPAR was up an industry-leading 10.6% and margins improved 190 basis points as strong ADR growth coupled with productivity improvements drove strong flowthrough. Our fee business continues its impressive growth, with managed and franchise revenues up 71.4%. Even after adjusting for the Host and Le Mridien transactions, we delivered 24.2% growth. Our vacation ownership business also exceeded our guidance as contract sales were up 13.5%, and reported revenues increased 43.1%.
Just as our brand initiatives resonate with the consumer, they are resonating with developers around the world, helping drive our pipeline growth as they increasingly turn to Starwood's brands for their hotel projects. We have signed 94 hotel deals, and opened 41 hotels year-to-date. We are on track to exceed our target for 50 hotel openings in 2006.
During the third quarter, we bought back 9 million shares of our stock, and since announcing the Host transaction last November, we have bought back $1.5 billion in stock. This is in addition to the $2.8 billion we returned through the Host transaction earlier this year and $276 million in dividends. With our impressive free cash flow generation and balance sheet strength, we have significant capacity to continue returning value to shareholders through our dividend policy and share buybacks while continuing to invest in the growth of our business.
We are optimistic that we will turn in another year of strong growth in 2007: Supply growth remains below its long-term trendline and the demand outlook is favorable, our business fundamentals remain very strong, and we expect these trends to continue."
Operating Results
Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2006
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
Worldwide REVPAR for Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels increased 11.7%. REVPAR at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 10.6%. REVPAR growth was particularly strong at the Company's owned hotels in Toronto, Chicago, Atlanta, and Philadelphia Internationally, Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 10.2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and as reported, in US dollars, branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 13.6%.
.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 9.4% while costs and expenses increased 6.6% when compared to 2005. Margins at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels increased 190 basis points.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide increased 9.4% while costs and expenses increased 7.7% when compared to 2005. Margins at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels increased 110 basis points.
Reported revenues at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $594 million when compared to $871 million in 2005. Reported revenues and operating income
 
were impacted by the sale of 51 hotels since the beginning of the third quarter of 2005. These hotels had $14 million of revenues and $11 million of expenses (before depreciation) in 2006 as compared to $344 million of revenues and $247 million of expenses (before depreciation) in the same quarter of 2005.
Management and Franchise Revenues
Worldwide System-wide (owned, managed and franchised) REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels increased 9.2% compared to the third quarter of 2005 including 16.8% in Europe, 10.5% in Africa & the Middle East, 8.6% in Latin America, 7.5% in North America, and 6.1% in Asia Pacific. The 7.5% increase in System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels in North America by brand was: St. Regis/Luxury Collection 12.8%, W Hotels 11.2%, Westin 8.5% and Sheraton 6.8%.
Management fees, franchise fees and other income were $182 million, up $56 million, or 44.4%, from the third quarter of 2005. Management fees grew 67.8% to $99 million and franchise fees grew 24.0% to $31 million. The increases are related to the addition of new hotels (including Le Mridien hotels and the hotels sold to third parties, including Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. ("Host")), and growth in REVPAR of existing hotels under management, offset in part by fees associated with hotels that left the system.
The hotels sold to Host and the Le Mridien hotels contributed $27 million and $16 million, respectively, of management and franchise revenues during the third quarter of 2006. Worldwide Le Mridien hotels that were in operation during both periods had REVPAR growth of 13.2% in the third quarter of 2006 when compared to 2005 with ADR increasing 13.1% and occupancy increasing 10 basis points.
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company signed 33 hotel management and franchise contracts (representing approximately 7,400 rooms: 10 Sheraton, 7 Westin, 6 aloft, 4 Four Points by Sheraton, 3 Le Mridien, 2 W Hotels, and 1 Luxury Collection). Of the hotels signed in the quarter, 28 were new builds and 5 were conversions from other brands. Through the first nine months of 2006, the Company signed 94 hotel management and franchise contracts (representing approximately 23,800 rooms). The Company's active global development pipeline grew to approximately 330 hotels with almost 90,000 rooms at September 30, 2006, driven by strong interest in all Starwood brands. Approximately half of its pipeline is in international locations.
During the third quarter of 2006, 18 new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 3,700 rooms) entered the system, including the Le Royal Meridien Shanghai (Shanghai, China, 600 rooms), the Sheraton Orlando North (Orlando, Florida, 394 rooms) and the W Maldives (Male, Maldives, 78 rooms). Eight properties (representing approximately 2,300 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter. The Company expects to open more than 50 hotels (representing approximately 14,000 rooms) in 2006.
Vacation Ownership
While contract sales of vacation ownership intervals were up 13.5%, total vacation ownership reported revenues increased 43.1% to $249 million when compared to 2005 due primarily to the timing of the recognition of deferred revenues under percentage of completion accounting for pre-sales at projects under construction. The average price per
 
vacation ownership unit sold increased 8.8% to approximately $25,000, and the number of contracts signed increased 4.4% when compared to 2005.
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company was actively selling vacation ownership interests at 15 resorts. Starwood Vacation Ownership is also in the predevelopment phase of several other new vacation ownership resorts in Hawaii, California, Mexico, and Aruba.
Residential
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company recognized residential revenues of approximately $6.0 million primarily from sales at the St. Regis in New York. To date, the Company has recognized approximately $34.1 million in revenues from the sale of condominiums at the St. Regis in New York. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company recognized residential revenues of $59 million primarily associated with sales at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses increased 17.3% to $115 million compared to the third quarter of 2005. The increase primarily relates to stock based compensation, including approximately $10 million of stock option expense.
Asset Sales
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company sold two wholly-owned hotels for cash proceeds of approximately $86 million. It is anticipated that two hotels will be sold in the fourth quarter of 2006 for cash proceeds of approximately $30 million.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $47 million in renovations of hotel assets including construction capital at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel, the Westin Resort & Spa, Cancun, and the Sheraton Kauai Resort. Investment spending on gross vacation ownership interest ("VOI") inventory was $88 million, which was offset by cost of sales of $64 million associated with VOI sales during the quarter. The inventory spend included VOI construction at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas North in Maui, the Westin Princeville Resort in Kauai, the Desert Willow Villas in Palm Desert, and the Westin Lagunamar Resort in Cancun.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company repurchased approximately 9 million shares at a total cost of approximately $477 million.

At September 30, 2006, approximately $414 million remained available under the Company's share repurchase authorization.

For the full year 2007:
The Company expects 2007 Adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.355 billion and $1.375 billion. This represents 13%-15% growth on a comparable basis over 2006 (see reconciliation below). The Company expects 2007 EPS to be between $2.40 and $2.46. This represents 20%-23% growth on a comparable basis over 2006.

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, restructuring and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA; however, the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding hotels sold to date, undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or hurricane damage). REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
 
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees offset by payments by Starwood under performance and other guarantees.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. Further results, performance and achievements may be affected by general economic conditions including the impact of war and terrorist activity, business and financing conditions, foreign exchange fluctuations, cyclicality of the real estate and the hotel and vacation ownership businesses, operating risks associated with the hotel and vacation ownership businesses, relationships with associates and labor unions, customers and property owners, the impact of the internet reservation channels, our reliance on technology, domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions, competition, governmental and regulatory actions (including the impact of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and their interpretation), travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases, risk associated with the level of our indebtedness, risk associated with potential acquisitions and dispositions, and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are presented in detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Future vacation ownership units indicated in this press release include planned units on land owned by the Company or by joint ventures in which the Company has an interest that have received all major governmental land use approvals for the development of vacation ownership resorts. There can be no assurance that such units will in fact be developed and, if developed, the time period of such development (which may be more than several years in the future). Some of the projects may require additional third-party approvals or permits for development and build out and may also be subject to legal challenges as well as a commitment of capital by the Company. The actual number of units to be constructed may be significantly lower than the number of future units indicated. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained or that results will not materially differ.
