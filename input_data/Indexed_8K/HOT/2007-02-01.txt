Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 1, 2007
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT) today reported strong fourth quarter 2006 financial results, driven by double-digit worldwide REVPAR increases and higher operating margins.
WHITE PLAINS, NY, February 1, 2007
Fourth Quarter 2006 Highlights
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 of $0.94 compared to $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding special items, EPS from continuing operations was $0.92 for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2006 was 21.4% including a $19 million benefit resulting from the recognition of certain tax credits related to 2005.
Income from continuing operations was $203 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $159 million in 2005. Excluding special items, which net to a $4 million benefit in 2006, income from continuing operations was $199 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $162 million in 2005.
Net income was $203 million and EPS was $0.93 in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to net income of $159 million and EPS of $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Steven J. Heyer, CEO, said, "I am extremely proud of what Starwood accomplished this year and am even more excited about our positioning for 2007. With our fee business now the largest contributor to our bottom line, our broad global presence, our industry-leading pipeline, and our significant brand initiatives throughout 2006, we are transforming from a cyclical real estate business into a leading global lifestyle brand company. We emerged from 2006 with the right asset mix, a clear strategy, focus, process and discipline. By any measure, it is clear our new model has been paying off. Today, Starwood is a higher-growth, more capital-efficient, cash-rich and less-cyclical business."
Heyer continued: "Fourth quarter results were impressive, beating our guidance. While North America branded REVPAR at Same-Store Owned Hotels increased at the high end of our guidance, up 8.6%, Worldwide REVPAR jumped 11.7%. Importantly, this REVPAR growth had great flow-through at these hotels, driving North American and Worldwide margin increases of over 150 basis points and 280 basis points, respectively. Worldwide System-wide REVPAR increased 11.4% and managed and franchised revenues increased 54.8% in the quarter.
Our pipeline's upward trajectory is a testament to the strength of our branding initiatives, our development focus, and our emphasis on building relationships with the best development partners in the world. We signed 156 new long-term hotel contracts this year, the most in our history, and according to December 2006 Smith Travel data, our brands
 
emerged as #1 overall in the upper-upscale and luxury development market, with 38% of the hotels and rooms in the pipeline today. This represents strong growth on an absolute basis, and significant market share gains. We have a leading position in the upper-upscale and luxury segments, and our global development group and brand teams are working to extend this lead.
Revenues at our timeshare division grew 13% year over year, and we expect our St Regis, Westin and Sheraton brands to continue driving strong growth in this under-penetrated business. Contract sales were up 15% in the quarter due to the combination of higher pricing and additional units sold.
We fully expect 2007 to be another great year for our company and we remain focused on our strategic initiatives  service excellence, brand development, pipeline development, vacation ownership growth, real estate development and repositionings. We believe that these initiatives will allow us to outperform the competition and continue to create value for our shareholders."
Operating Results
Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2006
Management and Franchise Revenues
Worldwide System-wide (owned, managed and franchised) REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels increased 11.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 including 24.8% in Africa & the Middle East, 17.0% in Europe, 12.5% in Latin America, 11.2% in Asia Pacific and 9.1% in North America. The 9.1% increase in System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels in North America by brand was: St. Regis/Luxury Collection 15.7%, W Hotels 13.5%, Westin 9.8% and Sheraton 7.7%.
Management fees, franchise fees and other income were $209 million, up $57 million, or 37.5%, from the fourth quarter of 2005. Management fees grew 57.4% to $107 million and franchise fees grew 34.8% to $31 million. The increases are related to the addition of new hotels (including Le Mridien hotels and the hotels sold to third parties, including Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. ("Host")), and growth in REVPAR of existing hotels under management, offset in part by fees associated with hotels that left the system.
The hotels sold to Host contributed $28 million, and the Le Mridien hotels added $16 million, respectively, of management and franchise revenues during the fourth quarter of 2006. The Le Mridien hotels contributed $5 million in the same quarter of 2005 as the Company acquired that business at the end of November of 2005. Excluding the hotels sold to Host, and fees from Le Mridien, management and franchise revenues increased 18.2% in the fourth quarter of 2006 when compared to 2005. Worldwide Le Mridien hotels that were in operation during both periods had REVPAR growth of 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2006 when compared to 2005 with ADR increasing 16.8% and occupancy increasing 290 basis points.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company signed 61 hotel management and franchise contracts (representing approximately 12,500 rooms: 15 Sheraton, 15 aloft, 11 Four Points by Sheraton, 9 Westin, 3 W Hotels, 2 Le Mridien, 2 Luxury Collection, 2 St. Regis, and 2 Element). Of the hotels signed in the quarter, 46 were new builds and 15
 
were conversions from other brands. For the full year, the Company signed 156 hotel management and franchise contracts (representing approximately 36,700 rooms). The Company now has roughly 400 hotels in the active pipeline and almost 100,000 rooms at December 31, 2006, driven by strong interest in all Starwood brands. Approximately half of the pipeline is in international locations.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, 18 new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 4,400 rooms) entered the system, including The Westin Chicago North Shore (Wheeling, Illinois, 411 rooms), The U.S. Grant (San Diego, California, 270 rooms) and The Westin St. Maarten, Dawn Beach Resort & Spa (St. Maarten, Netherland Antilles, 416 rooms). Eight properties (representing approximately 1,700 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter. The Company expects to open more than 80 hotels (representing approximately 20,000 rooms) in 2007 and is targeting signing approximately 200 hotel management and franchise contracts in 2007.
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
Worldwide REVPAR for Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels increased 11.7%. REVPAR at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 8.6%. REVPAR growth was particularly strong at the Company's owned hotels in Chicago, New York, Phoenix, and San Diego. Internationally, Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 12.5% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and as reported, in US dollars, branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 17.5%.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 8.3% while costs and expenses increased 6.1% when compared to 2005. Margins at these hotels increased 153 basis points.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide increased 10.6% while costs and expenses increased 6.5% when compared to 2005. Margins at these hotels increased 280 basis points.
Reported revenues at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $602 million when compared to $894 million in 2005. Reported revenues and operating income were impacted by the sale of 50 hotels since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2005. These hotels had $2 million of revenues and $1 million of expenses (before depreciation) in 2006 as compared to $358 million of revenues and $254 million of expenses (before depreciation) in the same quarter of 2005.
Vacation Ownership
While contract sales of vacation ownership intervals were up 15.0%, total vacation ownership reported revenues increased 108.1% to $310 million when compared to 2005 due primarily to the timing of the recognition of deferred revenues under percentage of completion accounting for pre-sales at projects under construction. The average price per vacation ownership unit sold increased 11.2% to approximately $27,000, and the number of contracts signed increased 3.5% when compared to 2005.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company was actively selling vacation ownership interests at 15 resorts. Starwood Vacation Ownership is also in the predevelopment phase
 
of several other new vacation ownership resorts in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mexico and Aruba.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company sold approximately $133 million of vacation ownership notes receivable and recognized gains of $17 million as compared to gains of $25 million in the same period of 2005.
Residential
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recognized residential revenues of approximately $12 million primarily from sales at the St. Regis in New York. To date, the Company has recognized approximately $40.7 million in revenues from the sale of condominiums at the St. Regis in New York. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized residential revenues of $43.0 million primarily associated with sales at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco which sold out in the first half of 2006.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses increased 33.3% to $128 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Approximately one-third of the increase is due to the impact of stock-based compensation, including stock option expense. The remaining increase includes investments in our global development capability, and costs associated with the launch of the Company's new brands, aloft and Element, as well as the addition of the Le Mridien business.
Asset Sales
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company sold two wholly-owned hotels for cash proceeds of approximately $29 million. Additionally, the Company received proceeds of approximately $20 million from the sales of two unconsolidated joint ventures in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $55 million in renovations of hotel assets including construction capital at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel, the Westin Cancun Resort & Spa, and the Westin Maui Resort. Investment spending on gross vacation ownership interest ("VOI") inventory was $107 million, which was offset by cost of sales of $74 million associated with VOI sales during the quarter. The inventory spend included VOI construction at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas North in Maui, the Westin Princeville Resort in Kauai, the Westin Kierland Resort in Arizona, Sheraton's Vistana Villages in Orlando, and the Westin Lagunamar Resort in Cancun.
Share Repurchase
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares at a total cost of approximately $34.2 million. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has returned more than $4.3 billion to shareholders, including $2.8 billion in connection with the sale of 33 hotels to Host, approximately $1.263 billion for the repurchase of approximately 21.7 million shares of its stock and $276 million in dividends. At December 31, 2006, approximately $380 million remained available under the Company's share
 
repurchase authorization. Starwood had approximately 214 million shares outstanding (including partnership units) at December 31, 2006.

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, restructuring and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA; however, the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered
 
as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding hotels sold to date, undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or hurricane damage). REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees offset by payments by Starwood under performance and other guarantees.

Note: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. Further results, performance and achievements may be affected by general economic conditions including the impact of war and terrorist activity, business and financing conditions, foreign exchange fluctuations, cyclicality of the real estate (including residential) and the hotel and vacation ownership businesses, operating risks associated with the hotel, vacation ownership and residential businesses, relationships with associates and labor unions, customers and property owners, the impact of the internet reservation channels, our reliance on technology, domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions, competition, governmental and regulatory actions (including the impact of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and their interpretation), travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases, risk associated with the level of our indebtedness, risk associated with potential acquisitions and dispositions, and the introduction of new brand concepts and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are presented in detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Future vacation ownership units indicated in this press release include planned units on land owned by the Company or by joint ventures in which the Company has an interest that have received all major governmental land use approvals for the development of vacation ownership resorts. There can be no assurance that such units will in fact be developed and, if developed, the time period of such development (which may be more than several years in the future). Some of the projects may require additional third-party approvals or permits for development and build out and may also be subject to legal challenges as well as a commitment of capital by the Company. The actual number of units to be constructed may be significantly lower than the number of future units indicated. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained or that results will not materially differ. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
