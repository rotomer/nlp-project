1.03 . Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Loans hereunder, it shall give the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each Base Rate Loan and at least three Business Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each Eurodollar Loan to be incurred hereunder,  that any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on a certain day only if given before 12:00 Noon (New York time) on such day. Each such written notice or written confirmation of telephonic notice (each, a ""), except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 1.11, shall be irrevocable and shall be given by the Borrower in the form of Exhibit A, appropriately completed to specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be incurred pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) whether the Loans being incurred pursuant to such Borrowing shall constitute B-1 Term Loans or B-2 Term Loans, (iv) whether the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing are to be initially maintained as Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, and (v) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto.

1.05 . No later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, each Lender will make available its portion (determined in accordance with Section 1.08) of each such Borrowing requested to be made on such date in the manner provided below. All such amounts will be made available in Dollars and in immediately available funds at the Payment Office of the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent will make available to the Borrower by depositing to its relevant account as directed by the Borrower, the aggregate of the amounts so made available by the Lenders. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and, to the extent such corresponding amount has previously been disbursed to the Borrower, the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover on demand from such Lender or the Borrower interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower until the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (i) if recovered from such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Rate as in effect from time to time and (ii) if recovered from the Borrower, the rate of interest applicable to the respective Borrowing, as determined pursuant to Section 1.09. Nothing in this Section 1.05 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to make Loans hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any failure by such Lender to make Loans required to be made by it hereunder.
Disbursement of Funds

1.06 . (a) Subject to the provisions of the following clause (c), the Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Loans made by each Lender to the Borrower shall be evidenced (i) if B-1 Term Loans, by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1, with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (each, a "" and, collectively, the ""), and (ii) if B-2 Term Loans, by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2, with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (each, a "" and, collectively, the "").

(b) Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount of each Loan made by it to the Borrower and each payment in respect thereof and will prior to any transfer of any of its Notes endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation, or any error in such notation, shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans. Each Lender's internal records of the amount of each Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof shall be final and conclusive absent manifest error.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above or elsewhere in this Agreement, Notes shall only be delivered to Lenders with Loans of the respective Tranches which at any time specifically request the delivery of such Notes. No failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Note evidencing its Loans or to the Borrower shall affect or in any manner impair the obligations of the Borrower to pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) which would otherwise be evidenced thereby in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and shall not in any way affect the guaranties therefor provided pursuant to the various Credit Documents. Any Lender which does not have a Note evidencing its outstanding Loans shall in no event be required to make the notations otherwise described in preceding clause (b). At any time when any Lender requests the delivery of a Note to evidence its Loans, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender the requested Note or Notes in the appropriate amount or amounts to evidence such Loans.
1.07 . The Borrower shall have the option to convert, on any Business Day occurring after the Closing Date, all or a portion equal to at least the Minimum Borrowing Amount (for the Type of Loan into which the conversion is being made), of the outstanding principal amount of Loans made pursuant to one or more Borrowings of one or more Types of Loans under a single Tranche into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another Type of Loan under such Tranche, that, (i) if Eurodollar Loans are converted into Base Rate Loans on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable to the Loans being converted, the Borrower shall compensate the applicable Lenders for any breakage costs incurred in connection therewith as set forth in Section 1.12, (ii) no such partial conversion of Eurodollar Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of such Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount for Eurodollar Loans, (iii) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, Base Rate Loans may not be converted into Eurodollar Loans if any Event of Default exists on the date of conversion, and (iv) no conversion pursuant to this Section 1.07 shall result in a greater number of Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans than is permitted under Section 1.02. Each such conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office, prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time), at least three Business Days' prior notice substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto (each, a "") specifying the Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such Loans were made and, if to be converted into Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto.

If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, the Borrower has failed to elect, or is not permitted to elect, a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loans as provided above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans, in any such case effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.
1.11 (a) If any Lender (or, with respect to clause (i) below, the Administrative Agent) shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone promptly confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and, except in the case of clause (i) above, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders).

provided
(c) If at any time after the Effective Date any Lender determines that the introduction of or any change (which introduction or change shall have occurred after the Effective Date) in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("") or any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender's Commitments hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then the Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon its written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital. In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, that such Lender's determination of compensation owing under this Section 1.11(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto. Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.11(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show in reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts.
NAIC
provided
(d) If any Lender shall in good faith determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto) at any time that such Lender is required to maintain reserves (including, without limitation, any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserves required by applicable law) which have been established by any Federal, state, local or foreign court or governmental agency, authority, instrumentality or regulatory body with jurisdiction over such Lender (including any branch, Affiliate or funding office thereof) in respect of any Eurodollar Loans or any category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on any Eurodollar Loan is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans of the same or similar type as any Eurodollar Loans, then, unless such reserves are already being charged for pursuant to Section 1.11(a)(ii), such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing specifying the additional amounts required to indemnify such Lender against the cost of maintaining such reserves (such written notice to provide in reasonable detail a computation of such additional amounts) and the Borrower shall, and shall be obligated to, pay to such Lender such specified amounts as additional interest at the time that the Borrower is otherwise required to pay interest in respect of such Eurodollar Loans or, if later, on written demand therefor by such Lender.

Each lending office and Affiliate of any Lender designated as provided above shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be treated in the same manner as the respective Lender (and shall be entitled to all indemnities and similar provisions in respect of its acting as such hereunder).

Nothing in this Section 1.13 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Sections 1.11 and 4.04.

The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrower's agent, solely for purposes of this Section 13.15, to maintain a register (the "") on which it will record the Commitments from time to time of each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitments shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitments and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section 13.04(b). Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note, if any, evidencing such Loan, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall, if requested, be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or the new Lender. The Borrower jointly and severally agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this Section 13.15.
