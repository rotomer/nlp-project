FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 2, 2007
 
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT) today reported strong second quarter 2007 financial results.
WHITE PLAINS, NY, August 2, 2007
Second Quarter 2007 Highlights
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2007 of $0.67 compared to $3.01 in the second quarter of 2006. Special items in 2007 net to a charge of $0.15 per share and primarily relate to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets at the Sheraton Bal Harbour which is being demolished and converted into a St. Regis hotel with residences and fractional units. Special items in 2006 net to a benefit of $2.27 per share primarily due to significant one-time income tax benefits realized in connection with the sale of 33 hotels to Host during the period. Excluding special items, EPS from continuing operations was $0.82 for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $0.74 in the second quarter of 2006. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2007 was 24.1% and benefited from the Company recognizing foreign tax credits generated in prior years.
Income from continuing operations was $145 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $680 million in 2006. Excluding special items, which net to a $33 million charge in 2007 and a $511 million credit in 2006, income from continuing operations was $178 million for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $169 million in 2006. The Company's earnings before special items during the second quarter of 2007 benefited from $27 million (pre tax) or $22 million (after tax) of earnings from an unconsolidated joint venture that sold several hotels during the quarter. In the second quarter of 2006, the Company recognized earnings before special items of $22 million from sales of hotels in unconsolidated joint ventures. The gains in 2006 had no related tax expense due to the utilization of capital loss carry-forwards.
Net income was $145 million and EPS was $0.67 in the second quarter of 2007 compared to net income of $680 million and EPS of $3.01 in the second quarter of 2006.
"Starwood's strong second quarter results are indicative of our globally diversified revenue streams, with worldwide System-wide REVPAR up 8.4%, fueled by our international business where REVPAR grew by 13.1%," said Chairman and Interim CEO Bruce Duncan in a statement. "Our pipeline now consists of approximately 105,000 rooms, of which over 70% are in the upper upscale and luxury segments and approximately half are outside of North America. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and bought back $471 million of our stock in the quarter."
Operating Results
Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2007
Management and Franchise Revenues
Worldwide System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels increased 8.4% compared to the second quarter of 2006 including 15.7% in Africa & the Middle East, 12.8% in Europe, 12.8% in Asia Pacific, 9.8% in Latin America and 5.0% in North America. Worldwide System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels by brand was: Le Mridien 15.7%, St. Regis/Luxury Collection 10.7%, Four Points by Sheraton 9.6%, W Hotels 8.5%, Sheraton 7.3% and Westin 6.5%.
 
Management fees, franchise fees and other income were $196 million, up $22 million, or 12.6%, from the second quarter of 2006. Management fees grew 12.8% to $106 million and franchise fees grew 19.4% to $37 million. Base management fees increased 16.1% and incentive fees increased 6.3%. Incentive fees in 2006 included the recognition of previously deferred incentive fees. Approximately 50% of the Company's management and franchise fees are generated in markets outside of North America.
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company signed 33 hotel management and franchise contracts (representing approximately 7,000 rooms: 9 Four Points by Sheraton, 8 alofts, 5 Westins, 3 Sheratons, 3 St. Regis hotels, 2 Le Mridiens, 2 Elements and 1 W Hotel). Of the hotels signed in the quarter, 31 were new builds and 2 were conversions from other brands.
At June 30, 2007, the Company had approximately 440 hotels in the active pipeline representing 105,000 rooms, driven by strong interest in all Starwood brands. Of these rooms, over 70% are in the upper upscale/luxury segment, half are outside of North America, and 60% represent management contracts.
During the second quarter of 2007, 26 new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 7,800 rooms) entered the system, including the Sheraton New Delhi Hotel (New Delhi, India, 220 rooms), The Westin Guangzhou (Guangzhou, China, 448 rooms), and the Sheraton Cable Beach Resort (Nassau, Bahamas, 694 rooms). Six properties (representing approximately 1,700 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter. The Company expects to open more than 80 hotels (representing approximately 20,000 rooms) in 2007 and is targeting signing approximately 200 hotel management and franchise contracts in 2007.
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
Worldwide REVPAR for Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels increased 10.4%. REVPAR at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 6.1%. Internationally, Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 10.3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and as reported, in US dollars, branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 17.7%.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide increased 8.9% while costs and expenses increased 6.7% when compared to 2006. Margins at these hotels increased 148 basis points.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 4.9% while costs and expenses increased 3.7% when compared to 2006. Margins at these hotels increased 77 basis points.
Revenues at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $634 million when compared to $674 million in 2006. Revenues and operating income were impacted by the sale or closure of 44 hotels since the beginning of the second quarter of 2006. These hotels had $5 million of revenues and $5 million of expenses (before depreciation) in 2007 as compared to $81 million of revenues and $60 million of expenses (before depreciation) in the same quarter of 2006.
 
Vacation Ownership
Total vacation ownership reported revenues increased 40.3% to $268 million when compared to 2006 due primarily to the timing of the recognition of deferred revenues under percentage of completion accounting for projects under construction. Originated contract sales of vacation ownership intervals increased 2.7% with strong growth in sales in the Company's open projects offset by a decline at the Westin Kierland Villas in Scottsdale, Arizona where the inventory is sold out. The average price per vacation ownership unit sold increased 0.8% to approximately $26,000, and the number of contracts signed increased 1.7% when compared to 2006. We expect originated sales growth to accelerate in the second half of the year.
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company was actively selling vacation ownership interests at 15 resorts and is also in the predevelopment phase of new fractional or vacation ownership resorts in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mexico and Aruba.
While the Company continues to expect strong growth in originated sales of vacation ownership products in 2008, the Company has experienced some delays in the entitlement and construction approval process at its newest projects in Maui and Aruba. As a result, the Company now expects its percentage-of-completion on these projects in 2008 to be lower than originally anticipated, which will negatively impact its reported earnings from vacation ownership next year. The project in Aruba has now received the appropriate approvals, and construction and sales will begin later this year. The Company expects construction and sales for its next Maui project to begin in the second half of 2008.
Residential
During the second quarter of 2007, residential revenues decreased to approximately $6 million from $43 million in the prior year as our existing residential inventory is substantially sold out. The St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco sold out in the first half of 2006 and the St. Regis New York has only a few units remaining in inventory.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses increased 7.4% to $130 million compared to the second quarter of 2006. The increase is due to investments in our global development capability and costs associated with the launch of the Company's new brands and initiatives.
Asset Sales
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company sold three wholly-owned hotels for cash proceeds of approximately $42 million. In addition, the Company received proceeds of $69 million related to the sale of several hotels by four unconsolidated joint ventures.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $53 million in renovations of hotel assets including construction capital at the new aloft and Element hotels under construction in Lexington, MA, the W Los Angeles in Westwood, CA, and the W San Francisco in San Francisco, CA. Investment spending on gross vacation ownership interest ("VOI") inventory was $82 million, which was offset by cost of sales of $64 million
 
associated with VOI sales during the quarter. The inventory spend included VOI construction at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas North in Maui, the Westin Princeville Resort in Kauai, the Westin Lagunamar Resort in Cancun, and the Westin St. John Resort and Villas in the Virgin Islands.
Share Repurchase
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased 6.8 million shares at a total cost of approximately $471 million. At June 30, 2007, approximately $701 million remained available under the Company's previously approved share repurchase authorization. Starwood had approximately 210 million shares outstanding (including partnership units) at June 30, 2007.
Balance Sheet
At June 30, 2007, the Company had total debt of $3.032 billion and cash and cash equivalents (including $293 million of restricted cash) of $567 million, or net debt of $2.465 billion, compared to net debt of $2.113 billion at the end of 2006.
At June 30, 2007, debt was approximately 35% fixed rate and 65% floating rate and its weighted average maturity was 4.5 years with a weighted average interest rate of 6.9%. The Company had cash (including total restricted cash) and availability under domestic and international revolving credit facilities of approximately $2.151 billion. Availability under domestic and international revolving credit facilities, not including cash and cash equivalents, was $1.584 billion. On June 29, 2007 the Company closed on new unsecured bank loans totaling $1 billion, with $500 million maturing in each of June 2009 and June 2010. The proceeds from these new loans were used to repay outstanding balances under the Company's revolving credit facility.
Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2007
EPS from continuing operations decreased to $1.23 compared to $3.34 in 2006. Excluding special items, EPS from continuing operations was $1.30 compared to $1.15 in 2006. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $282 million compared to $260 million in 2006. Net income was $267 million and EPS was $1.23 compared to $685 million and $3.02, respectively, in 2006.

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, restructuring and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA; however, the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding condo hotels, hotels sold to date and hotels undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or hurricane damage). References to Company Operated Hotel metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned and managed hotels. References to System-Wide metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, managed and franchised hotels. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
 
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees offset by payments by Starwood under performance and other guarantees.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. Further results, performance and achievements may be affected by general economic conditions including the impact of war and terrorist activity, business and financing conditions, foreign exchange fluctuations, cyclicality of the real estate (including residential) and the hotel and vacation ownership businesses, operating risks associated with the hotel, vacation ownership and residential businesses, relationships with associates and labor unions, customers and property owners, the impact of the internet reservation channels, our reliance on technology, domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions, competition, governmental and regulatory actions (including the impact of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and their interpretation), travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases, risk associated with the level of our indebtedness, risk associated with potential acquisitions and dispositions and the introduction of new brand concepts and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are presented in detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Future vacation ownership units indicated in this press release include planned units on land owned by the Company or by joint ventures in which the Company has an interest that have received all major governmental land use approvals for the development of vacation ownership resorts. There can also be no assurance that such units will in fact be developed and, if developed, the time period of such development (which may be more than several years in the future). Some of the projects may require additional third-party approvals or permits for development and build out and may also be subject to legal challenges as well as a commitment of capital by the Company. The actual number of units to be constructed may be significantly lower than the number of future units indicated. There can also be no assurance that agreements will be entered into for the hotels in the Company's pipeline and, if entered into, the timing of any agreement and the opening of the related hotel. Although we believe the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained or that results will not materially differ.
