Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Securities
The Company shall keep, at each such office or agency, a register for each series of Securities issued hereunder (the registers of all Security registrars being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security register" or the "registry books of the Company") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register Securities and shall register the transfer of Securities as in this Article Two provided. The Security register shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times the Security registrar shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and any Security registrar other than the Trustee. Upon due presentment for registration or registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any designated office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series for an equal aggregate principal amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Security by any Security registrar in the registry books of the Company maintained by such Security registrar, and delivery of such Security, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Security.
No person shall at any time be designated as or act as a Security registrar unless such person is at such time empowered under applicable law to act as such under and to the extent required by applicable law and regulations.
All Securities presented for registration of transfer or for exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer or exchange in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

The Company shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for the period of 15 days next preceding the selection of Securities of that series to be redeemed and thereafter until the date of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption, or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption in whole or in part except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.

(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes under this Indenture.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue its services as Depositary for such Global Security and no successor Depositary has been appointed within 90 days after such notice or (ii) ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as the Depositary and so notifies the Company, and no successor Depositary has been appointed within 90 days after such notice, (B) the Company determines at any time that the Securities shall no longer be represented by Global Securities and shall inform such Depositary of such determination and participants in such Depositary elect to withdraw their beneficial interests in the Securities from such Depositary, following notification by the Depositary of their right to do so, or (C) such exchange is made upon request by or on behalf of the Depositary in accordance with customary procedures, following the request of a Beneficial Owner seeking to exercise or enforce its rights under the Securities.
(3) Subject to clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
(4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
(5) Subject to the provisions of clause (7) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members (as defined below in clause (7)) and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.
(6) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (2) above, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of certificated Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company or the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.
Agent Members
. In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in the case of a mutilated Security shall, and in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Security may in its discretion, execute and, upon the written request or authorization of any officer of the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless from any loss or liability which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced and subsequently presented or claimed for payment and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
Section 2.07.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities
Upon the issuance of any substituted Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substituted Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless from any loss or liability which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced and subsequently presented or claimed for payment and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
Every substituted Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.07 by virtue of the fact that any Security is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities (printed, lithographed or typewritten). Temporary Securities shall be issuable in any authorized denomination and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every such temporary Security shall be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at the option of the holders thereof, either at the office or agency to be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02 or at any of such other offices or agencies as may be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 2.08.
Temporary Securities
All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, repayment, exchange or registration of transfer or for credit against any sinking fund shall, if surrendered to the Company, any Security registrar, any paying agent or any other agent of the Company or of the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and promptly cancelled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly cancelled by it, and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee may dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures and deliver a certificate of such disposition to the Company or, at the written request of the Company, shall deliver cancelled Securities to the Company. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Section 2.09.
Cancellation of Securities Paid, etc.
. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Section 2.10.
Computation of Interest
. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for the Securities evidenced thereby, every Global Security authenticated and delivered hereunder shall bear a legend in substantially the following form (or such other form as a securities exchange or Depositary may request or require):

. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable, as the case may be, (i) to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity and (ii) to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series, in either case except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for Securities of such series.
Section 3.01.
Applicability of Article
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment."
. In case the Company shall desire to exercise any right to redeem all, or, as the case may be, any part of, the Securities of any series in accordance with their terms, it shall fix a date for redemption and shall mail a notice of such redemption at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of Securities of such series so to be redeemed as a whole or in part at their last addresses as the same appear on the registry books of the Company and to the Trustee, except as the resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors to establish the terms of any series of Securities may otherwise provide. Such mailing shall be by first class mail. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
Section 3.02.
Notice of Redemption; Selection of Securities
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price at which the Securities of such series are to be redeemed (or if not then ascertainable, the manner of calculation thereof), the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice and that on and after said date any interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. Where the redemption price is not ascertainable at the time the notice of redemption is given as aforesaid, the Company shall notify the Trustee of said redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall specify the number or numbers of the Securities of that series to be redeemed. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of that series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
Prior to the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 3.02, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 4.04) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities or portions thereof so called for redemption, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company will give the Trustee notice not less than 60 days (or such shorter period as may be acceptable to the Trustee) prior to the redemption date as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and the Trustee shall select or cause to be selected, in such manner as in its sole discretion it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Securities of that series or portions thereof to be redeemed. Securities of a series may be redeemed in part only in multiples of the smallest authorized denomination of that series.
. If notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 3.02 or Section 3.05, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities or portions of such Securities, together with any interest accrued to said date) any interest on the Securities of such series or portions of Securities of such series so called for redemption shall cease to accrue. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; , , that any regularly scheduled installment of interest becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date according to their terms.
Section 3.03.
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
provided
however
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
. In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of that series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or (b) receive credit for the principal amount of Securities of that series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities; that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 3.04.
Satisfaction of Mandatory Sinking Fund Payments with Securities
provided
. Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash (which cash may be deposited with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 4.04) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.04 (which Securities, if not theretofore delivered, will accompany such certificate) and whether the Company intends to exercise its right to make a permitted optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series. Such certificate shall also state that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series. Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such certificate (or to deliver the Securities specified in this paragraph), the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date for that series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of such Securities subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the option to deliver or credit Securities as provided in Section 3.04 and without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment, if any, with respect to such series.
Section 3.05.
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash which shall equal or exceed $100,000 or the equivalent amount in the Specified Currency (if other than Dollars) (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request or determine) with respect to the Securities of any particular series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own paying agent) on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the next sinking fund payment date following the date of such payment) to the redemption of such Securities at the redemption price specified in such Securities for operation of the sinking fund together with accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own paying agent) to the redemption of Securities shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment received by the Trustee (or if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 4.04) for such series and, together with such payment (or such amount so segregated), shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.05. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee (or if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 4.04) on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own paying agent), together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited (or segregated) sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Securities of that series at maturity.
The Trustee shall select or cause to be selected the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in the last paragraph of Section 3.02, and the Company shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the manner provided in Section 3.02 except that the notice of redemption shall also state that the Securities are being redeemed by operation of the sinking fund. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03.
On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee in cash (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 4.04) a sum equal to any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption of Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section.
Neither the Trustee nor the Company shall redeem any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of such Securities by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a default in payment of interest, if any, on such Securities or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to such Securities, except that if the notice of redemption of any such Securities shall theretofore have been mailed in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee (or the Company if the Company is acting as its own paying agent) shall redeem such Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee (or segregated by the Company) for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of such Securities; , , that in case such default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived as provided herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next sinking fund payment date for such Securities on which such moneys may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section.
provided
however
. Any series of Securities may be made, by provision contained in or established pursuant to a supplemental indenture or a resolution of the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof, subject to repayment, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder on a date or dates specified prior to maturity, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued interest to the date of repayment, on such notice as may be required, , , that the holder of a Security may only elect partial repayment in an amount that will result in the portion of such Security that will remain Outstanding after such repayment constituting an authorized denomination, or combination thereof, of such Securities.
Section 3.06.
Repayment at the Option of the Holder
provided
however
. The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on each of the Securities of that series at the places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities.

In addition to such office or offices or agency or agencies, the Company may from time to time designate and maintain one or more additional offices or agencies within or outside the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, where the Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange, and the Company may from time to time rescind such designation, as it may deem desirable or expedient. The Company will give to the Trustee written notice of the location of each such office or agency and of any change of location thereof. In case the Company shall fail to maintain any such office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location thereof, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the principal office of the Trustee.
Section 4.02.

(2) that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) to make any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series when the same shall be due and payable; and
(3) that at any time during the continuance of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) specified in the preceding paragraph (2), such paying agent will, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by it.

If an Event of Default as contemplated by Sections 6.01(f) or 6.01(g) occurs, the principal amount (or, if the Securities of such series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portions of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding will become due and payable immediately. If any other Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in each and every such case, unless the principal of all of the Securities of such series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Securityholders of such series), may declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of such series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) of all the Securities of such series to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the Securities of such series contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.
