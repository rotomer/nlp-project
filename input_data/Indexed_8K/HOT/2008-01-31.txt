Exhibit-99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 31, 2008
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT) today reported strong fourth quarter 2007 financial results, driven by double-digit worldwide REVPAR increases and higher operating margins.
WHITE PLAINS, NY, January 31, 2008
Fourth Quarter 2007 Highlights
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 of $0.74 compared to $0.94 in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding special items, EPS from continuing operations was $0.79 for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2006. Strong hotel results in the fourth quarter of 2007 were offset by declines in the Company's vacation ownership and residential business, loss of earnings from hotels sold during the past year, and a higher tax rate. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 28.5%, compared to 21.4% in the same period of 2006 primarily related to the recognition in 2006 of certain tax credits generated in 2005.
Income from continuing operations was $146 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $203 million in 2006. Excluding special items, which net to a $11 million charge in 2007, income from continuing operations was $157 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $199 million in 2006.
Net income was $146 million and EPS was $0.74 in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to net income of $203 million and EPS of $0.93 in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Frits van Paasschen, CEO, said, "Starwood reported another terrific quarter, beating guidance on strength in our core lodging business. Performance was broad-based, but particularly strong in our international divisions, where system-wide RevPAR increased 20.2%. Our globally diversified pipeline grew to 120,000 rooms, and is skewed towards high quality rooms in the upper upscale and luxury segments where our brands have a commanding presence. Reflecting our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, we bought back 10.4 million shares, or over 5% of our diluted share count in the quarter."
Operating Results
Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2007
Management and Franchise Revenues
Worldwide System-wide (owned, managed and franchised) REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels increased 13.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, including 24.5% in Europe, 20.0% in Africa & the Middle East, 17.5% in Asia Pacific, 11.0% in Latin America and 7.8% in North America. Worldwide System-wide REVPAR increases for Same-Store Hotels by brand were: Le Mridien 23.4%, St. Regis/Luxury Collection 17.0%, Four Points by Sheraton 14.9%, W Hotels 13.4%, Sheraton 12.3% and Westin 8.4%.
Management fees, franchise fees and other income were $237 million, up $28 million, or 13.4%, from the fourth quarter of 2006. Management fees grew 17.8% to $126 million and franchise fees grew 35.5% to $42 million. Approximately 55% of the Company's management and franchise fees are generated in markets outside the United States.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company signed 61 hotel management and franchise contracts, representing approximately 13,000 rooms, of which 54 were new builds and 7 were conversions from other brands. For the full year, the Company signed 197 hotel management and franchise contracts, representing approximately 47,000 rooms.
 
At December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately 500 hotels in the active pipeline, representing 120,000 rooms, driven by strong interest in all Starwood brands. Of these rooms, almost 70% are in the upper upscale/luxury segment and over half are outside North America.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, 16 new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 3,800 rooms) entered the system, including the St. Regis Singapore (Singapore, 299 rooms), the Le Mridien Cambridge (Boston, Massachusetts, 210 rooms) and the Sheraton Kansas City (Kansas City, Missouri, 372 rooms). Fifteen properties (representing approximately 3,400 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter. For the full year in 2007, the Company opened 66 hotels with approximately 19,000 rooms.
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
Worldwide REVPAR for Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels increased 14.7%. REVPAR at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 12.0%. Internationally, Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 8.4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and as reported, in US dollars, branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 19.3%.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 10.0% while costs and expenses increased 6.5% when compared to 2006. Margins at these hotels increased 234 basis points.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide increased 13.0% while costs and expenses increased 10.7% when compared to 2006. Margins at these hotels increased 154 basis points.
Approximately 45% of Starwood's Owned Hotel earnings (before depreciation) is generated from outside the United States.
Revenues at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $631 million when compared to $602 million in 2006. Reported revenues and operating income were impacted by the sale and closing of 13 hotels since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2006. These hotels had $10 million of revenues and $9 million of expenses (before depreciation) in 2007 as compared to $50 million of revenues and $39 million of expenses (before depreciation) in the same quarter of 2006.
Vacation Ownership
Total vacation ownership reported revenues decreased 16.5% to $259 million when compared to 2006. Reported revenues are significantly impacted by the timing of the recognition of deferred revenues under percentage of completion accounting for projects currently under construction. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company was actively selling vacation ownership interests at 16 resorts. Starwood Vacation Ownership is also in the predevelopment phase of several other new vacation ownership resorts in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, and Mexico.
Originated contract sales of vacation ownership intervals decreased 8.0% primarily due to lower close rates in Hawaii as the Company's Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort North in Maui nears sell out. The average price per vacation ownership unit sold decreased 9.5%
 
to approximately $24,000, driven by a reduction in the percentage of total sales coming from higher priced Hawaii and St. Regis New York inventory, while the number of contracts signed increased 1.7% when compared to 2006.
As previously reported, there were no gains on the sale of notes receivable in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to gains of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Residential
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company's residential revenues were $6 million, compared to $12 million in the prior year as our residential inventory at the St. Regis New York is substantially sold out.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses increased 18.0% to $151 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase was primarily due to certain non-recurring costs totaling approximately $11 million, investments in our global development capability and costs associated with the launch of the Company's new brands, aloft and Element.
Asset Sales
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company completed the sale of four wholly-owned hotels for cash proceeds of approximately $55 million.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $74 million in renovations of hotel assets including construction capital at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel, the W Los Angeles, the Phoenician, and the Westin Maui Resort. Investment spending on gross vacation ownership interest ("VOI") inventory was $93 million, which was offset by cost of sales of $61 million associated with VOI sales during the quarter. The inventory spend included VOI construction at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas North in Maui, the Westin Princeville Resort in Kauai, the Westin Kierland Resort in Arizona, Sheraton's Vistana Villages in Orlando, and the Westin Lagunamar Resort in Cancun.
Share Repurchase
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased 10.4 million shares at a total cost of approximately $563 million. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 29.6 million shares at a total cost of approximately $1.787 billion. At December 31, 2007, approximately $593 million remained available under the Company's share repurchase authorization. Starwood had approximately 191 million shares outstanding (including partnership units) at December 31, 2007.
Dividend
The Company's 2007 dividend of $0.90 per share was declared by the Board of Directors in November 2007 and paid by the Company on January 11, 2008.
 
Balance Sheet
At December 31, 2007, the Company had total debt of $3.595 billion and cash and cash equivalents (including $204 million of restricted cash) of $366 million, or net debt of $3.229 billion, compared to net debt of $2.754 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2007.
At December 31, 2007, debt was approximately 41% fixed rate and 59% floating rate and its weighted average maturity was 4.2 years with a weighted average interest rate of 6.52%. The Company had cash (including total restricted cash) and availability under domestic and international revolving credit facilities of approximately $1.733 billion.
Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007
EPS from continuing operations decreased to $2.57 compared to $5.01 in 2006. Excluding special items, EPS from continuing operations was $2.76, compared to $2.73 in 2006. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $582 million compared to $607 million in 2006. Net income was $542 million and EPS was $2.57 compared to $1.043 billion and $4.69, respectively, in 2006. Total Company Adjusted EBITDA, which was significantly impacted by the sale of 56 hotels since the beginning of 2006, was $1.356 billion compared to $1.309 billion in 2006.
Outlook
While overall lodging trends are currently strong, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economic environment and its impact on travel patterns makes it difficult to predict future results with precision. As a result, the Company has adjusted its 2008 outlook to reflect this uncertainty and the possibility of a slowdown in U.S. lodging demand.
For the full year 2008:
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2008:
 
Special Items
The Company recorded net charges of $11 million (after-tax) for special items in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $4 million of net credits (after-tax) in the same period of 2006.
Special items in the fourth quarter of 2007 relate to losses on the sale of four hotels and restructuring and other special charges, primarily associated with the demolition of the Sheraton Bal Harbour.
The following represents a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before special items to income from continuing operations after special items (in millions, except per share data):

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. All references to "close rates" refer to the percentage of tours converted to actual sales of vacation ownership intervals. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, restructuring and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA; however, the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting, enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding condo hotels, hotels sold to date and hotels undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or hurricane damage). References to Company Operated Hotel metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned and managed hotels. References to System-Wide metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, managed and franchised hotels. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees offset by payments by Starwood under performance and other guarantees.

Note: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. Further results, performance and achievements may be affected by general economic conditions, including the duration and severity of any global or regional economic downturns, the availability of financing alternatives at acceptable terms, the impact of war and terrorist activity, business and financing conditions, foreign exchange fluctuations, cyclicality of the real estate (including residential) and the hotel and vacation ownership businesses, operating risks associated with the hotel, vacation ownership and residential businesses, relationships with associates and labor unions, customers and property owners, the impact of the internet reservation channels, our reliance on technology, domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions, competition, governmental and regulatory actions (including the impact of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and their interpretation), travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases, risk associated with the level of our indebtedness, risk associated with potential acquisitions and dispositions, and the introduction of new brand concepts and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are presented in detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Future vacation ownership units indicated in this press release include planned units on land owned by the Company or by joint ventures in which the Company has an interest that have received all major governmental land use approvals for the development of vacation ownership resorts. There can be no assurance that such units will in fact be developed and, if developed, the time period of such development (which may be more than several years in the future). Some of the projects may require additional third-party approvals or permits for development and build out and may also be subject to legal challenges as well as a commitment of capital by the Company. The actual number of units to be constructed may be significantly lower than the number of future units indicated. There can also be no assurance that agreements will be entered into for the hotels in the Company's pipeline and, if entered into, the timing of any agreement and the opening of the related hotel. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained or that results will not materially differ. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
