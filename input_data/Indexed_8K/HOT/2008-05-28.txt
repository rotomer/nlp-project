Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 23, 2008, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company") completed a public offering of $200,000,000 principal amount of the Companys 6.25% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes") and $400,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes" and, together with the 2013 Notes, the "Notes"). The 2013 Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 13, 2007 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated as of September 13, 2007 (the "2013 Supplement"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The 2018 Notes will be issued pursuant to the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the 2013 Supplement and Supplemental Indenture No. 2, dated as of May 23, 2008 (the "2018 Supplement") between the Company and the Trustee. The Base Indenture, as supplemented by the 2013 Supplement and the 2018 Supplement, is referred to herein as the "Indenture". The 2013 Notes are additional notes issued under the same indenture and supplemental indenture under which the Company previously issued and sold $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of such notes. The 2013 Notes will be of the same class and series as and otherwise identical to the Companys previously issued 6.25% Senior Notes due 2013. The Notes are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the Companys existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Interest on the 2013 Notes will be payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2008. Interest on the 2018 Notes will be payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2008. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at its option at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of:  100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excludi ng, the redemption date; and  the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Indenture) plus 35 basis points for the 2013 Notes and 45 basis points for the 2018 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, if a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in the foregoing paragraph, holders of Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their Notes for payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase. A "Change of Control Trigg ering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture) and a downgrade of the rating on the Notes below Baa3 by Moodys and BBB- by S&P. The net proceeds of the offering to the Company were approximately $597 million, which the Company intends to apply to reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The Notes were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to its registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-145894). The foregoing description of the Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture and the 2013 Supplement, which are filed as exhibits to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on September 17, 2007, and to the full text of the 2018 Supplement, which is filed herewith as exhibit 4.1 hereto, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
