Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 24, 2008
 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT) today reported second quarter 2008 financial results.
WHITE PLAINS, NY, July 24, 2008
Second Quarter 2008 Highlights
 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2008 of $0.56 compared to $0.67 in the second quarter of 2007. Excluding special items, which net to zero in 2008, EPS from continuing operations was $0.56 for the second quarter of 2008 compared to $0.82 in the second quarter of 2007. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2008 was 28.3% compared to 24.1% in the same period of 2007 primarily due to the recognition of foreign tax credits in the second quarter of 2007, which were generated in prior years.
Income from continuing operations was $107 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to $145 million in 2007. Excluding special items, which net to zero in 2008 and a $33 million charge in 2007, income from continuing operations was $107 million for the second quarter of 2008 compared to $178 million in 2007. The decline in 2008 results was primarily due to lower vacation ownership results and the inclusion, in 2007, of a $27 million gain from the sale of several hotels by a joint venture in which we held a minority interest.
Net income was $105 million and EPS was $0.56 in the second quarter of 2008 compared to $145 million and EPS of $0.67 in the second quarter of 2007.
Frits van Passchen, CEO said, "Starwood's global footprint and strong brands drove the Company's second quarter results above expectations and ahead of our competition. While international lodging demand remains solid, the economic picture in the US has continued to deteriorate, with lodging demand dropping significantly in May. We are pleased with our second quarter performance, but are focused on managing costs to minimize the impact of this slowdown. Despite the US economic picture, we remain bullish on our long-term growth prospects. Today, our pipeline consists of more than 120,000 high quality rooms with almost 60% outside the US."
Operating Results
Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2008
Management and Franchise Revenues
Worldwide System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels increased 9.6% (4.8% using constant dollars) compared to the second quarter of 2007. International System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels increased 18.6% (8.7% using constant dollars). Worldwide System-wide REVPAR increases by region were: 26.1% in Africa and the Middle East, 18.9% in Europe, 16.1% in Latin America, 14.0% in Asia Pacific, and 3.0% in North America. Worldwide System-wide REVPAR increases by brand were: Le Mridien 18.7%, Sheraton 10.5%, Four Points by Sheraton 9.5%, St. Regis/Luxury Collection 9.0%, Westin 5.6%, and W Hotels 1.5%.
Management fees, franchise fees and other income were $218 million, up $23 million, or 11.8%, from the second quarter of 2007. Management fees grew 8.5% to $115 million and franchise fees grew 18.9% to $44 million.
 
Approximately 55% of the Company's management and franchise fees are generated in markets outside the United States.
During the second quarter of 2008, the Company signed 37 hotel management and franchise contracts representing approximately 9,000 rooms of which 36 were new builds and 1 was a conversion from another brand. At June 30, 2008, the Company had approximately 500 hotels in the active pipeline representing over 120,000 rooms, driven by strong interest in all Starwood brands. Of these rooms, almost 70% are in the upper upscale and luxury segments and almost 60% are in international locations.
During the second quarter of 2008, 21 new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 5,000 rooms) entered the system, including the W Istanbul (Istanbul, Turkey, 134 rooms), the Sheraton Huizhou Beach Resort (Guangdong, China, 293 rooms) and three aloft hotels, officially launching our new brand. Thirteen properties (representing approximately 4,000 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter.
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
Worldwide REVPAR for Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels increased 6.8%. REVPAR at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 5.2%. Internationally, Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR increased 9.3% (down 2.0% using constant dollars).
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 4.4% while costs and expenses increased 5.2% when compared to 2007. Margins at these hotels decreased 58 basis points.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide increased 5.9% while costs and expenses increased 7.1% when compared to 2007. Margins at these hotels decreased 84 basis points.
Approximately 45% of Starwood's Owned Hotel earnings (before depreciation) are generated from outside the United States.
Revenues at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $620 million when compared to $634 million in 2007. Reported revenues and operating income were impacted by the sale or closure of 11 hotels since the beginning of the second quarter of 2007. These hotels had $0 million of revenues and $1 million of expenses (before depreciation) in 2008 as compared to $40 million of revenues and $35 million of expenses (before depreciation) in the same quarter of 2007.
Vacation Ownership
Total vacation ownership reported revenues decreased 28.4% to $192 million when compared to 2007. Reported revenues are impacted by the timing of the recognition of deferred revenues under percentage of completion accounting for projects under construction. During the second quarter of 2008, the Company was actively selling vacation ownership interests at 18 resorts and is also in the predevelopment phase of new fractional or vacation ownership resorts in California, Colorado, Hawaii, and Mexico.
 
Originated contract sales of vacation ownership intervals decreased 25.7% primarily due to the sellout of the Company's Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort North in Maui and a decline in demand. The impact in Hawaii was partly offset by strong results in Orlando. The average price per vacation ownership unit sold decreased 19.1% to approximately $21,000, driven by a higher sales mix of lower priced biennial inventory in Hawaii. The number of contracts signed decreased 7.7% when compared to 2007.
Vacation ownership results were ahead of the Company's expectations for the second quarter, primarily due to the favorable product mix of units sold, timing of expenses and other items that were realized earlier than expected. However, the Company now expects that full year 2008 results will be lower than prior guidance due to lower sales in Hawaii and of our fractional product, as well as lower financing income.
Conditions remain uncertain in the asset backed securities market. The Company continues to expect that it will complete a sale of vacation ownership notes receivable before the end of 2008. However, given market conditions, the Company is now assuming that it will sell a smaller amount of receivables, and based on current advance rates and spreads, it now expects the gain from this sale to be $10 million to $15 million, down $20 million from prior expectations.
Residential
During the second quarter of 2008, the Company's residential revenues were $2 million compared to $6 million in the prior year as our completed residential inventory is substantially sold out.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses increased 7.0% to $138 million compared to the second quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the reversal, in 2007, of a litigation reserve as a result of a favorable outcome to the Company.
Asset Sales
During the second quarter of 2008, the Company entered into purchase and sale agreements for the sale of two wholly-owned hotels. The expected proceeds from the sales, which are expected to close later in 2008, are approximately $123 million.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $61 million in renovations of hotel assets including construction capital at the Sheraton Steamboat Resort, Sheraton Fiji Resort, W Times Square, aloft Philadelphia, aloft Lexington and element Lexington. Investment spending on gross vacation ownership interest ("VOI") inventory was $120 million, which was offset by cost of sales of $36 million associated with VOI sales during the quarter. The inventory spend included VOI construction at the Sheraton Vistana Villages in Orlando, the Westin St. John Resort and Villas in the Virgin Islands, the Westin Riverfront Resort in Avon, and the Westin Lagunamar Ocean Resort in Cancun, as well as construction costs at the St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort in Miami Beach.
 
Share Repurchase
During the second quarter of 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares at a total cost of approximately $182 million. In the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 9.9 million shares at a total cost of approximately $459 million. At June 30, 2008, approximately $134 million remained available under the Company's previously approved share repurchase authorization. Starwood had approximately 187 million shares outstanding (including partnership units) at June 30, 2008.
Balance Sheet
At June 30, 2008, the Company had total debt of $4.054 billion and cash and cash equivalents (including $180 million of restricted cash) of $308 million, or net debt of $3.746 billion, compared to net debt of $3.229 billion at the end of 2007.
In May 2008, the Company completed a public offering of $200 million of the Company's 6.25% Senior Notes due 2013 and $400 million of the Company's 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018. The net proceeds were used to pay down the Company's revolving credit facility.

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, restructuring and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA; however, the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding condo hotels, hotels sold to date and hotels undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or hurricane damage). References to Company Operated Hotel metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned and managed hotels. References to System-Wide metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, managed and franchised hotels. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
 
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees offset by payments by Starwood under performance and other guarantees.

Note: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. Further results, performance and achievements may be affected by general economic conditions including the impact of war and terrorist activity, business and financing conditions, foreign exchange fluctuations, cyclicality of the real estate (including residential) and the hotel and vacation ownership businesses, operating risks associated with the hotel, vacation ownership and residential businesses, relationships with associates and labor unions, customers and property owners, the impact of the internet reservation channels, our reliance on technology, domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions, competition, governmental and regulatory actions (including the impact of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and their interpretation), travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases, risk associated with the level of our indebtedness, risk associated with potential acquisitions and dispositions and the introduction of new brand concepts and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are presented in detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Future vacation ownership units indicated in this press release include planned units on land owned by the Company or by joint ventures in which the Company has an interest that have received all major governmental land use approvals for the development of vacation ownership resorts. There can also be no assurance that such units will in fact be developed and, if developed, the time period of such development (which may be more than several years in the future). Some of the projects may require additional third-party approvals or permits for development and build out and may also be subject to legal challenges as well as a commitment of capital by the Company. The actual number of units to be constructed may be significantly lower than the number of future units indicated. There can also be no assurance that agreements will be entered into for the hotels in the Company's pipeline and, if entered into, the timing of any agreement and the opening of the related hotel. Although we believe the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained or that results will not materially differ.
