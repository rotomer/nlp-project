We also agree to provide to you pursuant to the terms of this letter agreement, promptly following your request, such additional confidential information relating to the operations and assets of the Company that you may request from time to time or that appear on Schedule "A" as ongoing information requests, except that, as provided below, we may refuse, at any time, to continue to provide you additional confidential information including the ongoing information requests listed on Schedule "A". You acknowledge that the Company's obligation to furnish information is limited to information that is reasonably available to the Company and that the Company is not obligated to provide information or analyses to you that it does not otherwise prepare or obtain in the course of business. All nonpublic, proprietary, confidential information about the Company furnished by us or our Representatives (as defined below) pursuant to this letter agreement, whether furnished before or after the date hereof, whether oral or written, and regardless of the manner in which it is furnished, is referred to in this letter agreement as "Proprietary Information". Proprietary Information does not include, however, information which (a) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your Representatives in breach of this letter agreement, (b) was available to you on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by us or our Representatives or (c) becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a person other than us or our Representatives who is not known by you to be otherwise prohibited from making such information available to you by a confidentiality agreement with us or any Representative of ours, or is otherwise not known by you to be prohibited from making such information available to you under a legal obligation to us or any Representative of ours not to transmit the information to you.

As used in this letter agreement, the terra "person" shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership, other entity or individual.
Except as required by law, regulatory authority or judicial or administrative proceeding, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you agree (a) to keep all Proprietary Information confidential and not to disclose or reveal any Proprietary Information to any person other than your Representatives and to use your commercially reasonable efforts to cause those persons to observe the terms of this letter agreement and (b) not to use Proprietary Information in connection with any action or use otherwise prohibited by the terms of this letter agreement. You will be responsible for any breach of the terms of this letter agreement by you or your Representatives. You agree that you shall be prohibited from disclosing or revealing such Proprietary Information to any partner of EGI-SSE I, L.P. that is not your affiliate and such partner's directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, counsel and accountants) and controlling persons.
