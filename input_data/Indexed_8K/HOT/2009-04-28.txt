Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 27, 2009, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company") amended its revolving credit and term loans facility (collectively with prior amendments the "Amended Credit Facilities") with the consent of the lenders thereunder. In addition, the Company issued a press release in connection with its entering into the Amended Credit Facilities. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Amended Credit Facilities enhance the Companys financial flexibility by increasing the Companys maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facilities) from 4.50x to 5.50x. Additionally, the definition of Consolidated EBITDA used in the Amended Credit Facilities has been modified to permit the add back of certain cash severance expenses. As conditions to the amendment, the Company agreed to increase the pricing on all outstanding revolving credit and term loans to include interest at the Base Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Facilities) plus a spread ranging from 0 basis points to 350.0 basis points, based upon the Companys Consolidated Leverage Ratio, the Companys unsecured debt rating and the type of loan borrowed. The amendments further modify the credit facilities by (i) restricting the Companys ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock depending on the Companys free cash flow and Consolidated Leverage Ratio and (ii) decreasing the Companys lien basket from 10% of Net Tangible Assets (as defined in the Amended Credit Facilities) to 5% of Net Tangible Assets. An amendment fee of 50.0 basis points was also paid to all consenting lenders who approved the Amended Credit Facilities and the Company repaid $500 million of its term loan that was due June 2009 by drawing down on its revolver, with no amendment fee being paid on the repaid portion of the term loan. Except as provided in the amendment, all other provisions of the Company ;s revolving credit and term loan facilities remain in full force and effect. The foregoing summary of the Amended Credit Facilities is qualified in its entirety by the amendments attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, which are incorporated herein by reference.
