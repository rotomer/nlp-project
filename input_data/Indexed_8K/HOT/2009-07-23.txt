WHITE PLAINS, NY, July 23, 2009
Second Quarter 2009 Highlights
 
Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Summary
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2009 of $0.72 per share compared to $0.56 in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding special items, which net to a benefit of $90 million in 2009 and zero in 2008, EPS from continuing operations was $0.22 for the second quarter of 2009 compared to $0.56 in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2009 was 26.5% compared to 28.3% in the same period of 2008.
Special items in the second quarter of 2009 totaled $90 million of net benefits ($0.50 per Share) primarily related to a $120 million deferred tax benefit partially offset by impairment charges of $26 million and restructuring charges of $4 million.
Income from continuing operations was $131 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $107 million in 2008. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $41 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $107 million in 2008.
Net income was $134 million and EPS was $0.74 in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $105 million and EPS of $0.56 in the second quarter of 2008.
Frits van Paasschen, CEO said, "Despite an estimated $10 million impact from H1N1 during the quarter, we were able to beat expectations based on our continued focus on managing costs and driving revenue. Economic times like these afford us the opportunity to realign the organization around a sustainably lower cost base while continuing to invest in our brands and global growth opportunities. So while the current environment remains extremely challenging, we are committed to our long-term growth strategy and by the end of 2009, 60% of our 1,000 hotels will have been opened or renovated during the past three years. We also executed on several transactions during the quarter that in the aggregate allowed us to raise nearly one billion dollars, further strengthening our already strong balance sheet."
Second Quarter 2009 Operating Results
Management and Franchise Revenues
Worldwide System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels decreased 27.7% (down 23.6% in constant dollars) compared to the second quarter of 2008. International System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels decreased 30.6% (down 22.8% in constant dollars). Worldwide System-wide REVPAR decreases by region were: 19.9% in Africa and the Middle East, 25.4% in North America, 30.1% in Asia Pacific, 34.4% in Europe and 36.4% in Latin America. Worldwide System-wide REVPAR decreases by brand were: Four Points by Sheraton 25.2%, Westin 25.6%, Sheraton 26.7%, W Hotels 30.5%, Le Mridien 31.3%, and St. Regis/Luxury Collection 35.1%.
Worldwide comparable company-operated gross operating profit margins declined approximately 530 basis points in the second quarter driven by REVPAR declines partially offset by continued cost-cutting efforts at the property level. International gross operating profit margins for comparable company-operated properties declined approximately 400
 
basis points, and North American comparable company-operated gross operating profit margins declined approximately 680 basis points.
Management fees, franchise fees and other income were $187 million, down $31 million, or 14.2%, from the second quarter of 2008. Management fees decreased 25.2% to $86 million and franchise fees decreased 22.7% to $34 million. The Company continued to work closely with its owner/partners to aggressively reduce costs, helping to minimize impact from the weak REVPAR environment.
During the second quarter of 2009, the Company signed 20 hotel management and franchise contracts representing approximately 4,300 rooms of which 17 are new builds and three are conversions from other brands. At June 30, 2009, the Company had over 375 hotels in the active pipeline representing over 90,000 rooms.
During the second quarter of 2009, 16 new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 3,200 rooms) entered the system, including the Le Mridien Dallas North (Dallas, TX, 258 rooms), W Fort Lauderdale Hotel and Residences (Fort Lauderdale, FL, 517 rooms), Le Westin Montreal (Montreal, Canada, 454 rooms) and four Aloft hotels in the United States. Ten properties (representing approximately 3,000 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter.
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
Worldwide REVPAR for Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels decreased 35.5% (down 30.5% in constant dollars). REVPAR at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America decreased 34.4% (down 32.5% in constant dollars). Internationally, Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR decreased 37.0% (down 27.5% in constant dollars).
The Company's continued rigorous cost cutting programs helped mitigate the impact of sharp revenue declines during the quarter.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America decreased 32.6% (down 30.6% in constant dollars) while costs and expenses decreased 20.1% when compared to 2008.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide decreased 34.4% (down 29.5% in constant dollars) while costs and expenses decreased 23.5% when compared to 2008.
Revenues at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $394 million when compared to $620 million in 2008
.
 
Vacation Ownership
Total vacation ownership reported revenues decreased 35.4% to $124 million when compared to 2008. Originated contract sales of vacation ownership intervals decreased 47.2% primarily due to an overall decline in demand due to the current economic climate. The average price per vacation ownership unit sold decreased 24.3% to approximately $16,000, driven by a higher sales mix of lower-priced inventory, including a higher percentage of lower-priced biennial inventory. The number of contracts signed decreased 29.9% when compared to 2008.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses decreased 30.4% to $96 million compared to the second quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the Company's focus on reducing its cost structure. A majority of the Company's cost containment initiatives have been completed and implemented during previous quarters, including identifying reductions across the corporate departments and divisional headquarters, for which the benefits are now being realized. These actions are expected to yield an annual run rate savings of approximately $100 million.
Asset Sales
During the second quarter of 2009, the Company sold one wholly-owned hotel for cash proceeds of approximately $4 million. The Company recorded a $3 million loss on the sale.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $38 million of maintenance capital and $21 million of development capital. Investment spending on vacation ownership interest ("VOI") and residential inventory was $31 million, primarily in Bal Harbour, Orlando, Rancho Mirage, and CancunThe run rate of capital spending on development and investment capital will decline throughout the year as in-flight projects are completed.
.
Balance Sheet
At June 30, 2009, the Company had total debt of $3.752 billion and cash and cash equivalents of $126 million (including $47 million of restricted cash), or net debt of $3.626 billion, compared to net debt of $3.794 billion and $3.517 billion as of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
At June 30, 2009, debt was approximately 68% fixed rate and 32% floating rate and its weighted average maturity was 4.2 years with a weighted average interest rate of 6.16%. The Company had cash (including current restricted cash) and availability under the domestic and international revolving credit facility of approximately $1.686 billion.
 
On April 27, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to its bank revolver due February 10, 2011 and bank term loans due June 29, 2009, June 29, 2010 and February 10, 2011. The amendment increased the leverage ratio from 4.5x to 5.5x (as defined in the agreements) in return for fees, higher interest rates and some additional modifications to the covenants. In addition, the Company pre-paid the $500 million bank term loan due June 29, 2009 by simultaneously drawing down on its revolver.
During the second quarter, the Company entered into various transactions that resulted in cash proceeds of nearly $1 billion as outlined below:
On May 7, 2009, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2014. The net proceeds were used to pay down the outstanding borrowings under its revolver and for general corporate purposes.
On June 5, 2009, the Company sold approximately $181 million of vacation ownership notes receivable realizing cash proceeds of $125 million. The Company recorded a loss on the sale of these receivables of $1.5 million.
The Company and American Express (NYSE: AXP) extended their Co-brand Credit Card partnership. The multi-year extension allows continued expansion of the program with positive benefits to both companies. Starwood and American Express have offered a portfolio of card products since 2001, and the Co-brand credit card has been named the best affinity credit card in the Americas at the Freddie Awards for three years running. On July 1, 2009, as part of the broad-based agreement, the Company received $250 million in cash from American Express and used these proceeds to pre-pay a portion of the 2010 bank term loan.
On July 7, 2009, the Company also announced the sale of the W San Francisco for $90 million. The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close on July 30, 2009.
As of July 22, 2009, before giving effect to the proceeds from the sale of the W San Francisco, the Company's total debt stands at $3.545 billion with no outstanding maturities in 2009 and $100 million outstanding under the 2010 bank term loan.
In addition to the actions described above, in January 2009 the Company and the IRS reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation pertaining to the tax treatment of the Company's 1998 disposition of World Directories, Inc. Under the proposed settlement, the Company expects to receive a refund of over $200 million as a result of tax payments previously made. The Company now expects to obtain the refund by the end of 2009.

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to Starwood's common shareholders. All references to continuing operations, discontinued operations and net income reflect amounts attributable to Starwood's common shareholders (i.e. excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests). All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as revenues and costs and expenses from hotels sold, restructuring and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. Due to guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company now does not reflect such items when calculating EBITDA; however, the Company continues to adjust for these special items and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding condo hotels, hotels sold to date and hotels undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or hurricane damage). References to Company Operated Hotel metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned and managed hotels. References to System-Wide metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, managed and franchised hotels. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees offset by payments by Starwood under performance and other guarantees.

Note: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. Further results, performance and achievements may be affected by general economic conditions including the impact of war and terrorist activity, business and financing conditions, foreign exchange fluctuations, cyclicality of the real estate (including residential) and the hotel and vacation ownership businesses, operating risks associated with the hotel, vacation ownership and residential businesses, relationships with associates and labor unions, customers and property owners, the impact of the internet reservation channels, our reliance on technology, domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions, competition, governmental and regulatory actions (including the impact of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and their interpretation), travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases, risk associated with the level of our indebtedness, risk associated with potential acquisitions and dispositions and the introduction of new brand concepts and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are presented in detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Future vacation ownership units indicated in this press release include planned units on land owned by the Company or by joint ventures in which the Company has an interest that have received all major governmental land use approvals for the development of vacation ownership resorts. There can also be no assurance that such units will in fact be developed and, if developed, the time period of such development (which may be more than several years in the future). Some of the projects may require additional third-party approvals or permits for development and build out and may also be subject to legal challenges as well as a commitment of capital by the Company. The actual number of units to be constructed may be significantly lower than the number of future units indicated. There can also be no assurance that agreements will be entered into for the hotels in the Company's pipeline and, if entered into, the timing of any agreement and the opening of the related hotel. Although we believe the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained or that results will not materially differ.
