 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: HOT) today reported fourth quarter 2009 financial results.
WHITE PLAINS, NY, February 4, 2010
Fourth Quarter 2009 Highlights
 
Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Summary
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported a loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $1.03 per share compared to $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding special items, which net to a charge of $281 million in 2009 and $133 million in 2008, EPS from continuing operations was $0.51 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 4.1% compared to 27.5% in the same period of 2008 primarily due to a lower overall effective tax rate on foreign earnings.
Special items in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled a pretax charge of $431 million ($281 million after tax or $1.54 per share) and were related to the following primarily non-cash charges:
The loss from continuing operations was $186 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $45 million in 2008. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $88 million in 2008.
The net loss was $107 million and $0.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to net income of $79 million and EPS of $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Frits van Paasschen, CEO said, "We ended 2009 with the best REVPAR results we have seen since the third quarter of 2008, and our continued focus on costs allowed us to beat expectations again in the quarter. Lodging demand continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with group and business transient posting positive bookings. After being buffeted by headwinds throughout 2009, our portfolio is set to begin a rebound in 2010 from a deep drop-off."
"We believe that our competitive position in the global marketplace as an operator of lifestyle hospitality brands continues to build. Importantly, the forces of globalization, capital flows, emerging middle class and demand for hotel infrastructure are alive and well, and we intend to capture more than our fair share of this growth."
 
Fourth Quarter 2009 Operating Results
Management and Franchise Revenues
Worldwide System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels decreased 7.2% (9.6% in constant dollars) compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. International System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store Hotels decreased 3.9% (8.4% in constant dollars).
Worldwide System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store changes by region:
Worldwide System-wide REVPAR for Same-Store changes by brand:
Worldwide Same-Store company-operated gross operating profit margins declined approximately 240 basis points in the fourth quarter driven by REVPAR declines, partially offset by continued cost-cutting efforts at the property level. International gross operating profit margins for Same-Store company-operated properties declined approximately 160 basis points, and North American Same-Store company-operated gross operating profit margins declined approximately 380 basis points.
Management fees, franchise fees and other income were $185 million, down $6 million, or 3.1%, from the fourth quarter of 2008. Management fees decreased 11.9% to $104 million and franchise fees decreased 2.8% to $35 million. Other income excludes revenues from the Company's former Bliss spa business which have been reclassified to discontinued operations for both 2009 and 2008 as a result of the sale of Bliss at the end of 2009.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company signed 20 hotel management and franchise contracts, representing approximately 4,200 rooms, of which 16 are new builds and four are conversions from other brands. At December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately 350 hotels in the active pipeline representing approximately 85,000 rooms.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2009, 24 new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 5,000 rooms) entered the system, including the W Barcelona (Spain, 473 rooms), the Westin Hyderabad Mindspace (India, 252 rooms), the Le Mridien Chongqing (China, 319 rooms), the Sheraton Puerto Rico Convention Center Hotel & Casino (San Juan, 503 rooms), the W Boston (Massachusetts, 235 rooms) and seven Aloft hotels. Fourteen properties (representing approximately 4,000 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter.
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
Worldwide REVPAR for Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels decreased 7.9% (10.9% in constant dollars). REVPAR at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America decreased 9.6% (10.7% in constant dollars). Internationally, Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotel REVPAR decreased 4.6% (11.3% in constant dollars).
The Company's continued rigorous cost cutting programs helped mitigate the impact of sharp revenue declines during the quarter.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America decreased 11.0% (12.2% in constant dollars) while costs and expenses decreased 5.7% when compared to 2008.
Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide decreased 8.8% (11.9% in constant dollars) while costs and expenses decreased 6.3% when compared to 2008.
Revenues at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $430 million when compared to $493 million in 2008
.
Vacation Ownership
Total vacation ownership revenues of $134 million were flat when compared to 2008. Originated contract sales of vacation ownership intervals decreased 10.9% primarily due to an overall decline in demand due to the current economic climate. The average price per vacation ownership unit sold decreased 7.1% to approximately $15,000, driven by a higher sales mix of lower-priced inventory, including a higher percentage of biennial inventory. The number of contracts signed decreased 5.5% when compared to 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company sold vacation ownership notes receivable and recognized gains of $23 million.
As previously announced, during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company completed a comprehensive review of its vacation ownership projects. No new projects are being initiated and the Company has decided not to develop certain vacation ownership sites and future phases of certain existing projects. As a result, inventories, fixed assets and land values at certain projects were determined to be impaired and were written down to their fair value, resulting in a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $255 million. Additionally, in connection with this review of the business, the Company made a decision to reduce the pricing of certain inventory at existing projects, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $17 million, recorded in the vacation ownership and residential costs and expenses line.
 
Finally, as a result of these decisions and the Company's future plans for the vacation ownership business, the Company recorded a $90 million non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill associated with the vacation ownership business.
The Company believes it has a best-in-class team at SVO, with some of the best brands and resorts in the industry. These decisions reflect Starwood's new strategy for the vacation ownership business, including reducing its capital requirements and positioning SVO to generate cash for the Company.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses increased 8.2% to $79 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Costs and expenses related to the Company's former Bliss spa business have been reclassified to discontinued operations for both 2009 and 2008 as a result of the sale of Bliss at the end of 2009.
Restructuring Charges, Goodwill Impairment and Other Special Charges, Net
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $355 million, including $255 million of impairment charges related to vacation ownership projects and a $90 million charge related to the impairment of vacation ownership goodwill, as discussed above, and $10 million of severance and other costs associated with its ongoing initiative of rationalizing its cost structure in light of the current economic climate.
Loss on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $42 million primarily related to five owned hotels where their carrying value exceeded their estimated fair values as a result of the significant decline in the business at those hotels.
Discontinued Operations
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company sold its Bliss spa business, its Fifth Avenue retail shops at the St. Regis New York, and other non-core assets for cash proceeds of $227 million. Revenues and expenses from these entities, together with revenues and expenses from two hotels which are in the process of being sold, have been reclassified to discontinued operations resulting in a loss of $1 million, net of tax. In addition, the net gain on these sales has been recorded in discontinued operations resulting in income of $80 million, net of tax. Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect these reclassifications.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $40 million of maintenance capital and $28 million of development capital. Investment spending on net vacation ownership interest ("VOI") and residential inventory was $4 million, primarily in Bal Harbour. The run rate of spending on development and investment capital declined throughout the year as in-flight projects were completed.
 
Dividend
In October 2009, the Company's Board of Directors declared its annual dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend was paid by the Company on January 14, 2010 to holders of record on December 31, 2009.
Balance Sheet
At December 31, 2009, the Company had total debt of $2.960 billion and cash and cash equivalents of $141 million (including $54 million of restricted cash), or net debt of $2.819 billion, compared to net debt of $3.207 billion and $3.517 billion as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.
At December 31, 2009, debt was approximately 78% fixed rate and 22% floating rate and its weighted average maturity was 5.1 years with a weighted average interest rate of 6.73%. The Company had cash (including current restricted cash) and availability under the domestic and international revolving credit facility of approximately $1.735 billion.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company completed a series of dispositions and financing transactions that resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $650 million as outlined below:
IRS Tax Settlement
In January 2009, the Company and the IRS reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation pertaining to the tax treatment of the Company's 1998 disposition of World Directories, Inc. Under the proposed settlement, the Company expects to receive a refund in 2010 of over $200 million as a result of tax payments previously made.
Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009
The loss from continuing operations was $1 million or $0.00 per share in 2009, compared to income from continuing operations of $249 million, or $1.34 per share in 2008. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $188 million, or $1.02 per share in 2009, compared to $400 million, or $2.16 per share in 2008. Net income was $73
 
million and EPS was $0.41 in 2009, compared to $329 million and $1.77, respectively, in 2008. Total Company Adjusted EBITDA, which was impacted by the sale or closure of 15 hotels since the beginning of 2008, was $793 million in 2009, compared to $1.157 billion in 2008.
Outlook
For the Full Year 2010:
It is very difficult at this time to provide any definitive point of view on 2010. While business conditions continue to improve from depressed levels, it is very hard to forecast the pace of recovery, especially rate. While group bookings have picked up, booking pace for 2010 has continued to lag behind 2009. Booking windows for both transient and group business have remained short. As such, late breaking business is a larger component of what will drive our performance in 2010 making forward looking predictions four quarters out particularly challenging. What we can provide are broad guidelines that we are using for internal planning purposes:
Based on our fourth quarter results and our expectations for the first quarter, full year 2010 REVPAR at Same-Store Company Operated Hotels Worldwide could be flat to +5% in local currency and approximately 100 bps higher in dollars at current exchange rates. REVPAR at Branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide could be -2% to +2% in local currency and approximately 100 bps higher in dollars at current exchange rates.
At the midpoint of these REVPAR ranges, adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $750 million (+/- one point of REVPAR drives +/- $15 million of EBITDA).
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2010:
Impact of SFAS 167
The Company adopted SFAS 167 on January 1, 2010. This new accounting rule impacts the accounting for securitized vacation ownership loans. As a result of the adoption of this rule, the Company expects its reported assets (accounts receivable and other assets) to increase by approximately $400 million and its reported liabilities (short-term and long-term debt) to increase by $445 million, prior to any tax effects. Also as a result of the accounting change, vacation ownership pretax earnings for 2010 are expected to increase by approximately $20 million to $23 million and EBITDA is expected to increase by approximately $40 million to $45 million. The new accounting rule is not expected to have any impact on the Company's cash flow.
 
Special Items
The Company's special items netted to a pre-tax charge of $431 million ($281 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $195 million ($133 million after-tax) in the same period of 2008.
The following represents a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before special items to income from continuing operations including special items (in millions, except per share data):

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to Starwood's common shareholders. All references to continuing operations, discontinued operations and net income reflect amounts attributable to Starwood's common shareholders (i.e. excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests). All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as restructuring, goodwill impairment and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding condo hotels, hotels sold to date and hotels undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or natural disasters). References to Company Operated Hotel metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned and managed hotels. References to System-Wide metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, managed and franchised hotels. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees offset by payments by Starwood under performance and other guarantees.

Note: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. Further results, performance and achievements may be affected by general economic conditions including the impact of war and terrorist activity, business and financing conditions, foreign exchange fluctuations, cyclicality of the real estate (including residential) and the hotel and vacation ownership businesses, operating risks associated with the hotel, vacation ownership and residential businesses, relationships with associates and labor unions, customers and property owners, the impact of the internet reservation channels, our reliance on technology, domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions, competition, governmental and regulatory actions (including the impact of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and their interpretation), travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases, risk associated with the level of our indebtedness, risk associated with potential acquisitions and dispositions and the introduction of new brand concepts and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are presented in detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Future vacation ownership units indicated in this press release include planned units on land owned by the Company or by joint ventures in which the Company has an interest that have received all major governmental land use approvals for the development of vacation ownership resorts. There can also be no assurance that such units will in fact be developed and, if developed, the time period of such development (which may be more than several years in the future). Some of the projects may require additional third-party approvals or permits for development and build out and may also be subject to legal challenges as well as a commitment of capital by the Company. The actual number of units to be constructed may be significantly lower than the number of future units indicated. There can also be no assurance that agreements will be entered into for the hotels in the Company's pipeline and, if entered into, the timing of any agreement and the opening of the related hotel. Although we believe the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained or that results will not materially differ. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
