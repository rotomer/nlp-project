WHITE PLAINS, NY, April 29, 2010
First Quarter 2010 Highlights
 
First Quarter 2010 Earnings Summary
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2010 of $0.16 per share compared to $0.04 in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding special items, which net to a benefit of $6 million in 2010 and a charge of $18 million in 2009, EPS from continuing operations was $0.13 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2010 was 14.5% compared to 17.8% in the same period of 2009.
Income from continuing operations was $30 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $9 million in 2009. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $24 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $27 million in 2009.
Net income was $30 million and EPS was $0.16 in the first quarter of 2010 compared to net income of $6 million and EPS of $0.03 in the first quarter of 2009.
Frits van Paasschen, CEO said, "Lodging demand for our nine global brands accelerated as we moved through the first quarter, allowing us to beat expectations on robust top-line growth. We continued to hold the line on costs. Most encouraging for us was that occupancy gains were led by the luxury market. This benefits Starwood, thanks to our leading presence in the four and five star categories. With the depths of the downturn behind us, we have a long runway ahead as we move into the upcycle."

At March 31, 2010, the Company had approximately 350 hotels in the active pipeline representing approximately 85,000 rooms.
During the first quarter of 2010, 14 new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 2,600 rooms) entered the system, including the W Hollywood Hotel & Residences (California, 160 rooms), the Westin Mumbai Garden City (India, 88 rooms), the Westin Austin at the Domain (Texas, 331 rooms), and the Sheraton Qiandao Lake Resort (China, 250 rooms). Seven properties (representing approximately 4,200 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter.

.
 
Vacation Ownership
Total vacation ownership revenues decreased 2.2% to $131 million when compared to 2009. Originated contract sales of vacation ownership intervals decreased 4.9% primarily due to the closure of fractional sales centers in 2009. Excluding fractional, originated contract sales decreased 0.8% compared to 2009. The average price per vacation ownership unit sold decreased 7.5% to approximately $16,800, driven by price reductions and a higher percentage of biennial inventory. The number of contracts signed increased 3.6% when compared to 2009 due to higher closing efficiency partly offset by lower tour flow.
Vacation ownership results include the impact of ASU 2009-17 (formerly SFAS 167) discussed further below.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses increased 4.1% to $76 million compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $16 million of maintenance capital and $13 million of development capital. Investment spending on net vacation ownership interest ("VOI") and residential inventory was $30 million, primarily related to the St. Regis Bal Harbour project.
Dividend
In October 2009, the Company's Board of Directors declared its annual dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend was paid by the Company on January 14, 2010 to holders of record on December 31, 2009.
Impact of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2009-17
The Company adopted ASU 2009-17 (formerly SFAS 167) on January 1, 2010, which required the consolidation of entities associated with our previous securitization transactions. As a result of the adoption of this rule, on January 1, 2010 the Company's assets (primarily short-term and long-term securitized vacation ownership notes receivable net of loan loss reserve) increased by approximately $401 million and its liabilities (primarily short-term and long-term securitized vacation ownership debt) increased by $444 million. Beginning retained earnings was reduced by $26 million (net of tax) as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. As a result of applying ASU 2009-17, vacation ownership revenues in the first quarter of 2010 increased $14 million compared to 2009 and interest expense includes $6 million related to the securitized vacation ownership debt.
Balance Sheet
At March 31, 2010, the Company had gross debt of $3.047 billion, excluding $406 million of debt associated with securitized vacation ownership notes receivable that was required to be consolidated beginning on January 1, 2010. Additionally, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $164 million (including $73 million of restricted cash), or net debt of
 
$2.883 billion, compared to net debt of $2.819 billion as of December 31, 2009. Net debt at March 31, 2010 including debt associated with securitized vacation ownership notes receivable was $3.289 billion.
At March 31, 2010, debt was approximately 76% fixed rate and 24% floating rate and its weighted average maturity was 4.7 years with a weighted average interest rate of 6.88% excluding the securitized debt. The Company had cash (including current restricted cash) and availability under the domestic and international revolving credit facility of approximately $1.679 billion.
On April 15, 2010, the Company completed the sale of two hotels for gross proceeds of $78 million.
On April 20, 2010, the Company executed a new $1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility ("New Facility"). The New Facility matures on November 15, 2013 and replaces the existing $1.875 billion Revolving Credit Agreement, which would have matured on February 11, 2011. The New Facility enhances the Company's financial flexibility and is expected to be used for general corporate purposes.
IRS Tax Settlement
In January 2009, the Company and the IRS reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation pertaining to the tax treatment of the Company's 1998 disposition of World Directories, Inc. Under the proposed settlement, the Company expects to receive a refund in 2010 of over $200 million as a result of tax payments previously made.
Outlook
For the Full Year 2010:
Based on our first quarter results and our expectations for the second quarter, full year 2010 REVPAR at Same-Store Company Operated Hotels Worldwide could be up 5% to 8% in constant dollars and approximately 100 bps higher in dollars at current exchange rates. REVPAR at Branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide could be up 4% to 7% in constant dollars and approximately 100 bps higher in dollars at current exchange rates.
At the midpoint of these REVPAR ranges, adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $810 million (+/- 1 point of REVPAR drives +/- $15 million of EBITDA).
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2010:
 
Special Items
The Company's special items netted to a pre-tax benefit of $1 million ($6 million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2010 compared to a $22 million charge ($18 million after-tax) in the same period of 2009.
The following represents a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before special items to income from continuing operations including special items (in millions, except per share data):
 
The Company has included the above supplemental information concerning special items to assist investors in analyzing Starwood's financial position and results of operations.

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to Starwood's common shareholders. All references to continuing operations, discontinued operations and net income reflect amounts attributable to Starwood's common shareholders (i.e. excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests). All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company as well as for individual properties or groups of properties because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as restructuring, goodwill impairment and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
 
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding condo hotels, hotels sold to date and hotels undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or natural disasters). References to Company Operated Hotel metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned and managed hotels. References to System-Wide metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, managed and franchised hotels. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology.
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees offset by payments by Starwood under performance and other guarantees.
