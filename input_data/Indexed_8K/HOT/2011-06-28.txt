Explanatory Note
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A (this "Amendment") updates information originally provided under Item 5.07 in a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed May 10, 2011 (the "Original Filing"), in which Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company") reported voting results for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 5, 2011 (the "2011 Annual Meeting"), including the voting results for both the Company's non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of its named executive officers (the "Say-on-Pay Vote") and the Company's non-binding stockholder advisory vote regarding the frequency for future Say-on-Pay Votes (the "Frequency Vote"). Except for the foregoing, this Amendment does not modify or update any other disclosure contained in the Original Filing, and this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Original Filing.
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
On May 10, 2011, the Company reported in the Original Filing that a majority of its stockholders entitled to vote at the 2011 Annual Meeting had voted to recommend, on a non-binding advisory basis, an annual frequency for future Say-on-Pay Votes.
On June 27, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors determined that, consistent with the Board of Directors' recommendation for the 2011 Annual Meeting, the Company will hold future Say-on-Pay Votes on an annual basis until the next Frequency Vote is conducted.
