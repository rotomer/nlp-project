WHITE PLAINS, NY, July 28, 2011
Second Quarter 2011 Highlights
 
Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Summary
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2011 of $0.77 per share compared to $0.42 in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding special items, EPS from continuing operations was $0.50 for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $0.35 in the second quarter of 2010. Special items in the second quarter of 2011, which totaled $53 million (after-tax), primarily relate to a tax benefit associated with the sale of two wholly-owned hotels. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2011 was 25.4%, compared to 16.1% in the second quarter of 2010.
Income from continuing operations was $150 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared to $79 million in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $97 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared to $67 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Net income was $131 million and $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2011 compared to $114 million and $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Net income in the second quarter of 2011 includes an $18 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations from the sale of a consolidated joint venture hotel and net income in the second quarter of 2010 included a $36 million after-tax gain in discontinued operations from the sale of a wholly-owned hotel.
Frits van Paasschen, CEO said, "We continue to see strong demand across both business and leisure travelers. This demand fueled growth across each of our nine distinct and compelling brands. Our efforts to hold the line on costs enabled us to beat EBITDA and EPS expectations in the quarter."
"Our senior leadership team relocated to China for the month of June as part of an effort to get closer to this growing market. Being there has reinforced our view that China and other rapidly growing markets represent a once-in-a-lifetime growth opportunity for us. Our asset light business model and global brands are well-positioned to benefit from this phenomenon."

Worldwide Same-Store company-operated gross operating profit margins increased approximately 90 basis points compared to 2010. International gross operating profit margins for Same-Store company-operated properties were flat, negatively impacted by political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the earthquake in Japan. North American Same-Store company-operated gross operating profit margins increased approximately 170 basis points, driven by REVPAR increases and cost controls.
Management fees, franchise fees and other income were $201 million, up $24 million, or 13.6% from the second quarter of 2010. Management fees increased 11.0% to $111 million and franchise fees increased 19.5% to $49 million. Excluding North Africa and Japan, management fees increased 16.1%.
During the second quarter of 2011, the Company signed 22 hotel management and franchise contracts, representing approximately 5,900 rooms, of which 20 are new builds and two are conversions from other brands. At June 30, 2011, the Company had over 350 hotels in the active pipeline representing almost 90,000 rooms.
 
During the second quarter of 2011, 13 new hotels and resorts (representing approximately 2,900 rooms) entered the system, including the W St. Petersburg (Russia, 137 rooms), St. Regis Bangkok (Thailand, 116 rooms), Sheraton Bangalore (India, 230 rooms), The Westin Playa Conchal (Costa Rica, 406 rooms) and The Chatwal, a Luxury Collection Hotel (New York, 83 rooms). Six properties (representing approximately 1,700 rooms) were removed from the system during the quarter, including the 941 room Boston Park Plaza, where we sold our interest in the quarter.
Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels
Worldwide REVPAR for Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels increased 18.5% (12.5% in constant dollars) in the second quarter of 2011 when compared to 2010. REVPAR at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 10.8% (8.7% in constant dollars).

Revenues at Starwood branded Same-Store Owned Hotels Worldwide increased 15.0% (9.3% in constant dollars) while costs and expenses increased 11.7% (6.5% in constant dollars) when compared to 2010. Margins at these hotels increased approximately 225 basis points.
Revenues at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $478 million, compared to $437 million in 2010. Expenses at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $381 million compared to $347 million in 2010. Second quarter results were impacted by the effect of the earthquake at the new leased St. Regis Osaka, five renovations and three asset sales.
Vacation Ownership
Total vacation ownership revenues increased 9.9% to $144 million compared to 2010. Originated contract sales of vacation ownership intervals increased 8.1% primarily due to improved sales performance from existing owner channels and increased tour flow from new buyer preview packages. The number of contracts signed increased 5.3% when compared to 2010 and the average price per vacation ownership unit sold increased 2.0% to approximately $14,800, driven by inventory mix.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses decreased 4.3% to $88 million compared to $92 million in 2010. Selling, general, administrative and other expenses declined relative to 2010 due to lower accruals for incentive compensation and lower legal expenses, offset by a weaker dollar.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $51 million of maintenance capital and $32 million of development capital. Net investment spending on
 
vacation ownership interest ("VOI") and residential inventory was $31 million, primarily related to the St. Regis Bal Harbour project.
Asset Sales
During the quarter, the Company completed the sales of two wholly-owned hotels, the Westin Gaslamp (San Diego) and W City Center (Chicago), for cash proceeds of approximately $237 million. These hotels were sold subject to long-term management contracts. Additionally during the quarter, the Company sold a consolidated joint venture hotel, the Boston Park Plaza, for cash proceeds of approximately $44 million and the buyer assumed $57 million of debt that was previously on our balance sheet. The Company recognized an after-tax loss in discontinued operations of $18 million as a result of the sale.
Balance Sheet
At June 30, 2011, the Company had gross debt of $2.800 billion, excluding $422 million of debt associated with securitized vacation ownership notes receivable. Additionally, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.060 billion (including $61 million of restricted cash), and net debt of $1.740 billion, compared to net debt of $2.121 billion as of March 31, 2011. Net debt at June 30, 2011 including debt and restricted cash ($18 million) associated with securitized vacation ownership notes receivables was $2.144 billion.
At June 30, 2011, debt was approximately 77% fixed rate and 23% floating rate and its weighted average maturity was 3.74 years with a weighted average interest rate of 6.79% excluding the securitized debt. The Company had cash (including current restricted cash) and availability under the domestic and international revolving credit facility of approximately $2.546 billion.
Outlook
For the three months ended September 30, 2011:
 
For the Full Year 2011:
Macro-economic and geo-political environments remain uncertain. We believe that several scenarios are possible. With low supply growth in developed markets and high demand growth in emerging markets, rate improvement will be the key driver of 2011 results. Based on trends to date, our outlook assumes a normal lodging recovery in 2011, negatively impacted by Japan, North Africa and Mexico; and asset sales completed year to date:
 
 
Special Items
The Company's special items netted to a benefit of $2 million ($53 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2011 compared to a benefit of $21 million ($12 million after-tax) in the same period of 2010.

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to Starwood's common shareholders. All references to continuing operations, discontinued operations and net income reflect amounts attributable to Starwood's common shareholders (i.e. excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests). All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company, as well as for individual properties or groups of properties, because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as restructuring, goodwill impairment and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding condo hotels, hotels sold to date and hotels undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or natural disasters). References to Company Operated Hotel metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned and managed hotels. References to System-Wide metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, managed and franchised hotels. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
 
All references to revenues in constant dollars represent revenues, excluding the impact of the movement of foreign exchange rates. The Company calculates revenues in constant dollars by calculating revenues for the current year using the prior year's exchange rates. The Company uses this revenue measure to better understand the underlying results and trends of the business, excluding the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology. All references to earnings from vacation ownership and residential represents operating income before depreciation expense.
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees.

Note: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. Further results, performance and achievements may be affected by general economic conditions including the impact of war and terrorist activity, natural disasters, business and financing conditions (including the condition of credit markets in the U.S. and internationally), foreign exchange fluctuations, cyclicality of the real estate (including residential) and the hotel and vacation ownership businesses, operating risks associated with the hotel, vacation ownership and residential businesses, relationships with associates and labor unions, customers and property owners, the impact of the internet reservation channels, our reliance on technology, domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions, competition, governmental and regulatory actions (including the impact of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and their interpretation), travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases, risk associated with the level of our indebtedness, risk associated with potential acquisitions and dispositions and the introduction of new brand concepts and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are presented in detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Future vacation ownership units indicated in this press release include planned units on land owned by the Company or by joint ventures in which the Company has an interest that have received all major governmental land use approvals for the development of vacation ownership resorts. There can also be no assurance that such units will in fact be developed and, if developed, the time period of such development (which may be more than several years in the future). Some of the projects may require additional third-party approvals or permits for development and build out and may also be subject to legal challenges as well as a commitment of capital by the Company. The actual number of units to be constructed may be significantly lower than the number of future units indicated. There can also be no assurance that agreements will be entered into for the hotels in the Company's pipeline and, if entered into, the timing of any agreement and the opening of the related hotel. Although we believe the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained or that results will not materially differ. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
