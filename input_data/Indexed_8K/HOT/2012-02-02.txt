"Our strong and growing presence in the emerging markets fueled almost 21,000 room openings in 2011, the most in our Company's history. These openings bring our five year total to 389 new hotels.

As we look to 2012, it is shaping up to be another record year of room additions and strong REVPAR growth."
"Our efforts to Own the Global Guest are helping us grow faster than the market and driving returns for owners and shareholders.

Outlook
In Developed markets, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain with high unemployment and high public/private debt. While there are increasing concerns about slower, "new" normal demand growth, the lodging supply situation is very favorable. In Emerging markets, macroeconomic growth has been strong, driving high secular growth in both lodging demand and supply. We remain of the view that several scenarios could play out. Our outlook below reflects our Baseline Scenario for the full year 2012:

Special Items
The Company's special items netted to a charge of $98 million ($18 million after-tax benefit) in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to a benefit of $69 million ($107 million after-tax) in the same period of 2010.
The following represents a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before special items to income from continuing operations including special items (in millions, except per share data):
 
 
During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded restructuring and other special credits of $73 million primarily related to the favorable settlement of a lawsuit and the reversal of a reserve from a previous acquisition no longer deemed necessary. Additionally, the year ended December 31, 2010 includes $2 million of restructuring credits associated with the reversal of previous restructuring reserves no longer deemed necessary.
 
During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the net loss primarily relates to the impairment of fixed assets at an owned hotel that is undergoing a significant renovation, offset by a gain on the sale of non-core assets. The year ended December 31, 2010 also includes a loss of $53 million from the sale of one owned hotel partially offset by a gain of $14 million from property insurance proceeds related to an owned hotel damaged by a tornado and a $5 million gain that resulted from the step acquisition of a controlling interest in a previously unconsolidated joint venture.
 
 
During the three months and year ended December 31, 2010, the net expense primarily relates to a tax expense at the statutory rate for restructuring credits partially offset by a benefit related to a gain on the sale of a joint venture investment.
 
During the three months and year ended December 31, 2010, a $42 million benefit primarily relates to a refund from the IRS of approximately $245 million primarily for previously paid taxes and related interest associated with the settlement of a dispute regarding the 1998 disposition of World Directories, Inc. An additional benefit of $134 million, associated with this settlement, was recorded in discontinued operations.

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to Starwood's common shareholders. All references to continuing operations, discontinued operations and net income reflect amounts attributable to Starwood's common shareholders (i.e. excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests). All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the total Company, as well as for individual properties or groups of properties, because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as restructuring, goodwill impairment and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding condo hotels, hotels sold to date and hotels undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or natural disasters). References to Company Operated Hotel metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned and managed hotels. References to System-Wide metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, managed and franchised hotels. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
 
All references to revenues in constant dollars represent revenues, excluding the impact of the movement of foreign exchange rates. The Company calculates revenues in constant dollars by calculating revenues for the current year using the prior year's exchange rates. The Company uses this revenue measure to better understand the underlying results and trends of the business, excluding the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology. All references to earnings from vacation ownership and residential represents operating income before depreciation expense.
All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees.
