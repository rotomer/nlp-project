Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 1, 2012, the Board of Directors of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company") authorized the Company to repurchase an additional $250 million of its common stock under its Share Repurchase Program. As of August 1, 2012, the total amount available under the authorization is approximately $360 million. The Company expects the purchases to be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades, tender offers or otherwise (including, without limitation, using Rule 10b5-1 plans), or in privately negotiated transactions (including, without limitation, accelerated share repurchase agreements). The timing of the share repurchases under the Program will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and share repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Shares of common stock acquired through the Program will be held as treasury shares, until such time as they may be re-issued for general corporate purposes or retried by the Company. Cautionary Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
