Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Summary
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood" or the "Company") today reported EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2012 of $0.75 compared to $0.85 in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding special items, EPS from continuing operations was $0.58 for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $0.60 in the third quarter of 2011. Special items in the third quarter of 2012, which totaled a benefit of $33 million (after-tax), primarily related to an income tax benefit on the sale of two wholly-owned hotels. Special items in the third quarter of 2011, which totaled a benefit of $47 million (after-tax), primarily related to a gain on an asset exchange transaction. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 was 30.8% compared to a benefit of 4.8% in the third quarter of 2011. The effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2011 included a favorable settlement of an IRS audit.
Income from continuing operations was $147 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $165 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $114 million in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $118 million in the third quarter of 2011 and included a $35 million benefit associated with the favorable settlement of an IRS audit.
Net income was $170 million and $0.87 per share in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $163 million and $0.84 per share in the third quarter of 2011. Net income in the third quarter of 2012 benefited from a $23 million (net of tax) reversal of reserves, following the favorable settlement, in the quarter, of certain liabilities associated with a former ITT subsidiary.
Frits van Paasschen, CEO, said, "We delivered another solid quarter of EBITDA and EPS growth led by continued gains in both room rates and occupancy. Global RevPAR grew nearly 5% in constant currency, despite a deceleration in the global economy. In fact, occupancy rose in all regions and is now reaching or exceeding peak levels in many markets around the world."
"Looking ahead, our results will be driven by two things: first, the trajectory of the global recovery and whether it regains its momentum in 2013; and second, our ability to use our high-end, global brands, to get more than our fair share of the long-term growth in global travel."
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012 Earnings Summary
Income from continuing operations was $405 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to $344 million in the same period in 2011.

Expenses at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were $348 million compared to $361 million in 2011.

Vacation Ownership
Total vacation ownership revenues increased 2.2% to $141 million in the third quarter of 2012 when compared to 2011, primarily due to the increased revenues from resort operations. Originated contract sales of vacation ownership intervals and numbers of contracts signed decreased 1.2% and 3.8%, respectively, primarily due to lower tour flow partially offset by a slight increase in the average price of vacation ownership units sold. The average price per vacation ownership unit sold increased 1.8% to approximately $14,300, driven by inventory mix.
 
Residential
The Company's residential revenues were $67 million compared to $2 million in 2011. The Company realized residential revenues from Bal Harbour during the third quarter of 2012 of $62 million and generated EBITDA of $12 million.

From project inception through September 30, 2012, the Company has closed contracts on approximately 64% of the total residential units available at Bal Harbour.
Selling, General, Administrative and Other
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses decreased 1.1% to $87 million compared to $88 million in 2011. The Company is now targeting a 3% to 4% increase for the full year.
Capital
Gross capital spending during the quarter included approximately $37 million of maintenance capital and $78 million of development capital.
Asset Sales
During the quarter, the Company completed the sales of two wholly-owned hotels, the W Chicago - Lakeshore and W Los Angeles - Westwood, for cash proceeds of approximately $244 million. These hotels were sold subject to long-term management contracts.
Timeshare Securitization
On October 24, 2012, the Company completed a securitization involving the issuance of $165.7 million of fixed rate notes. Starwood is contributing approximately $174.4 million in timeshare mortgages resulting in an advance rate of 95% with an effective note yield of 2.02%. The proceeds from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes and the pay down of the securitized vacation ownership debt related to its 2005 securitization.
Dividend
The Board of Directors has declared the Company's annual cash dividend of $1.25 per share, an increase of 150% from the prior year. The dividend will be paid on December 28, 2012 to shareholders of record on December 14, 2012.

Outlook
For the Full Year 2012:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2012:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the Full Year 2013:
At this point, the Company expects REVPAR at Same-Store Company-Operated Hotels Worldwide to increase 4% to 7% in constant dollars. The Company also expects Bal Harbour to contribute approximately $30 million to $40 million in EBITDA, which is approximately $100 million lower than 2012. Asset sales completed to date will reduce 2013 EBITDA by approximately $20 million year over year and approximately $30 million on an annualized basis. The Company will provide more details on its 2013 expectations in February.
 
Special Items
The Company's special items netted to a benefit of $1 million ($33 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2012 compared to a benefit of $45 million ($47 million after-tax) in the same period of 2011.
The following represents a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before special items to income from continuing operations including special items (in millions, except per share data):
 
 
During the three months ended September 30, 2011, the net gain primarily relates to an asset exchange transaction. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the gain from the asset exchange transaction was partially offset by the impairment of a minority investment in a joint venture hotel located in Japan.
During the three months ended September 30, 2011, the benefit relates primarily to a tax benefit on the asset exchange transaction described above and the utilization of capital loss carry forwards, partially offset by tax expense as the result of a settlement of an IRS audit. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, in addition to the activity in the third quarter, the tax benefit primarily relates to the sale of two wholly-owned hotels with high tax bases as a result of a previous transaction.

The Company has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and as a means to emphasize the results of core on-going operations.

Definitions
All references to EPS, unless otherwise noted, reflect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to Starwood's common stockholders. All references to continuing operations, discontinued operations and net income reflect amounts attributable to Starwood's common stockholders (i.e. excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests). All references to "net capital expenditures" mean gross capital expenditures for timeshare and fractional inventory net of cost of sales. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance due to the significance of the Company's long-lived assets and level of indebtedness. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in its industry which, when considered with GAAP measures, the Company believes gives a more complete understanding of the Company's operating performance. It also facilitates comparisons between the Company and its competitors. The Company's management has historically adjusted EBITDA (i.e., "Adjusted EBITDA") when evaluating operating performance for the Company, as well as for individual properties or groups of properties, because the Company believes that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items, such as restructuring, goodwill impairment and other special charges and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of core operating results and as a means to evaluate comparative results. The Company's management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and it is used in the annual budget process. The Company has historically reported this measure to its investors and believes that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in its financial reporting and enables investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and provides a means to evaluate the results of its core on-going operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and such metrics should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other performance measure prescribed by GAAP. The Company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
All references to Same-Store Owned Hotels reflect the Company's owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, excluding condo hotels, hotels sold to date and hotels undergoing significant repositionings or for which comparable results are not available (i.e., hotels not owned during the entire periods presented or closed due to seasonality or natural disasters). References to Company-Operated Hotel metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, leased and managed hotels. References to Systemwide metrics (e.g. REVPAR) reflect metrics for the Company's owned, managed and franchised hotels. REVPAR is defined as revenue per available room. ADR is defined as average daily rate.
All references to revenues in constant dollars represent revenues, excluding the impact of the movement of foreign exchange rates. The Company calculates revenues in constant dollars by calculating revenues for the current year using the prior year's exchange rates. The Company uses this revenue measure to better understand the underlying results and trends of the business, excluding the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.
All references to contract sales or originated sales reflect vacation ownership sales before revenue adjustments for percentage of completion accounting methodology. All references to earnings from vacation ownership and residential represents operating income before depreciation expense. All references to management and franchise revenues represent base and incentive fees, franchise fees, amortization of deferred gains resulting from the sales of hotels subject to long-term management contracts and termination fees.

Some of the projects may require additional third-party approvals or permits for development and build out and may also be subject to legal challenges as well as a commitment of capital by the Company. The actual number of units to be constructed may be significantly lower than the number of future units indicated.
