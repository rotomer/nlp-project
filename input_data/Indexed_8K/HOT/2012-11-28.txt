The terms and conditions of the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation are described in an offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement, dated November 26, 2012 (the "Statement"), and a related Letter of Transmittal and Consent. Starwood reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount or the Maximum Tender Amount with respect to any series of Notes without extending withdrawal rights except as required by law.

Holders of Notes who validly tender (and do not withdraw) their Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 7, 2012 (the "Early Tender Date") and whose Notes are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will receive the Tender Offer Consideration for such series, plus the applicable early tender premium set forth in the table above (the "Early Tender Premium" and, together with the Tender Offer Consideration, the "Total Consideration").
