(i) all Mexican Pesos Revolving Loans comprising a single Borrowing shall at all times have the same Mexican Pesos Interest Period;
(ii) if any Mexican Pesos Interest Period for a Mexican Pesos Revolving Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Mexican Pesos Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; , , that if any Mexican Pesos Interest Period for a Mexican Pesos Revolving Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such Mexican Pesos Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and

(b) At any time that any Euro Rate Loan or Permitted Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 1.11(a)(ii) or (iii), the respective Borrower may (and in the case of a Euro Rate Loan or a Permitted Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loan affected by the circumstances described in Section 1.11(a)(iii) shall) either (x) if the affected Euro Rate Loan or Permitted
 
Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loan is then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel the respective Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) on the same date that such Borrower was notified by the affected Lender or the Administrative Agent or (y) if the affected Euro Rate Loan or Permitted Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to the Administrative Agent, (A) in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, request the affected Lender to convert such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan (which conversion, in the case of the circumstances described in Section 1.11(a)(iii), shall occur no later than the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Loan (or such earlier date as shall be required by applicable law)) and (B) in the case of a Non-Dollar Alternate Currency Revolving Loan maintained as a Euro Rate Loan, or a Permitted Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loan, repay such Alternate Currency Revolving Loan in full; that (i) if the circumstances described in Section 1.11(a)(iii) apply to any such Non-Dollar Alternate Currency Revolving Loan, the respective Alternate Currency Revolving Loan Borrower may, in lieu of taking the actions described above, maintain such Non-Dollar Alternate Currency Revolving Loan outstanding, in which case the applicable Euro Rate or Alternate Currency Non-LIBOR Rate, as the case may be, shall be determined on the basis provided (x) in the case of a Euro Rate Loan, in the proviso appearing in the definition of the relevant Euro Rate, (y) in the case of a Mexican Pesos Revolving Loan, in the second proviso appearing in the definition of TIIE Rate and (z) in the case of any Other Permitted Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loan, in the applicable Non-LIBOR Based Alternate Currency Amendment, unless the maintenance of such Non-Dollar Alternate Currency Revolving Loan outstanding on such basis would not stop the conditions described in Section 1.11(a)(iii) from existing (in which case the actions described above, without giving effect to this proviso, shall be required to be taken) and (ii) if more than one Lender is affected at any time as described above in this clause (b), then all affected Lenders must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 1.11(b).

corporation. In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, that such Lender's determination of compensation owing under this Section 1.11(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto. Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.11(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Corporation, which notice shall show in reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts.
provided
(d) If any Lender shall in good faith determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto) at any time that such Lender is required to maintain reserves (including, without limitation, any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserves required by applicable law) which have been established by any Federal, state, local or foreign court or governmental agency, authority, instrumentality or regulatory body with jurisdiction over such Lender (including any branch, Affiliate or funding office thereof) in respect of any Euro Rate Loans or any Permitted Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loan or any category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on any Euro Rate Loan or Permitted Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loan is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans of the same or similar type as any Euro Rate Loans or Permitted Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loans, then, unless such reserves are already being charged for pursuant to Section 1.11(a)(ii), such Lender shall promptly notify the respective Borrower or Borrowers in writing specifying the additional amounts required to indemnify such Lender against the cost of maintaining such reserves (such written notice to provide in reasonable detail a computation of such additional amounts) and the respective Borrower or Borrowers shall, and shall be obligated to, pay to such Lender such specified amounts as additional interest at the time that the respective Borrower or Borrowers are otherwise required to pay interest in respect of such Euro Rate Loans or Permitted Non-LIBOR-Based Alternate Currency Revolving Loans, as the case may be, or, if later, on written demand therefor by such Lender.

(f) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (other than a Competitive Loan) to a Subsidiary Borrower incorporated or organized in a jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender or its lending office is reduced) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Subsidiary Borrower is incorporated or organized in a jurisdiction outside of the United States, such Subsidiary Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction promptly after written demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent).
 
(g) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 1.11 or Section 2.06 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 1.11 or Section 2.06 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Corporation of the change in law (or similar event) giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

It is understood that the amount of funds delivered by each RL Lender shall be calculated on a net basis, giving effect to both the sales and purchases of participations by the various RL Lenders and Swingline Lenders as required above.
(d) Upon, and after, the occurrence of a Sharing Event (i) no further Credit Events shall be made or shall occur, (ii) all amounts from time to time accruing with respect to, and all amounts from time to time payable on account of, Non-Dollar Alternate Currency Revolving Loans and Alternate Currency Swingline Loans (including, without limitation, any interest and other amounts which were accrued but unpaid on the date of such Sharing Event) shall be payable in Dollars (taking the Dollar Equivalents of all such amounts on the date of the occurrence of such Sharing Event, with all calculations after such Sharing Event being made as if the respective Non-Dollar Alternate Currency Revolving Loan or Alternate Currency Swingline Loan had originally been made in Dollars) and shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant RL Lenders (or their affiliates) which made such Revolving Loans and Alternate Currency Swingline Loans or are participating therein and (iii) the Revolving Loan Commitments (and the Alternate Currency Revolving Loan Sub-Commitments and Domestic Dollar Revolving Loan Sub-Commitments) of the RL Lenders shall be automatically terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the failure of any RL Lender to purchase its participating interests in any extensions of credit upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event shall not relieve any other RL Lender of its obligation hereunder to purchase its participating interests in a timely manner, but no RL Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other RL Lender to purchase the participating interest to be purchased by such other RL Lender on any date.
(e) If any amount required to be paid by any RL Lender pursuant to Section 1.17(c) is not paid to the Administrative Agent within one Business Day following the date upon which such RL Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent of the amount of its participations required to be purchased pursuant to said Section 1.17(c), such RL Lender shall also pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount so required to be paid by such RL Lender for the purchase of its participations (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate, during the period from and including the date of request for payment to but excluding the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Administrative Agent (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any RL Lender pursuant to Section 1.17(c) is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent within three Business Days following the date upon which such RL Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of participations required to be purchased by it, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover from such RL Lender on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such request date at the rate per annum applicable to Dollar Revolving Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans hereunder.

Amounts payable by any RL Lender pursuant to this Section 1.17 shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant RL Lenders; that, if the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion) has elected to fund on behalf of such RL Lender the amounts owing to such RL Lenders, then the amounts shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for its own account.

(f) Whenever, at any time after the relevant RL Lenders have received from any RL Lenders purchases of participations in any Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 1.17, the various RL Lenders receive any payment on account thereof, such RL Lenders will distribute to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the various RL Lenders participating therein, such RL Lenders' participating interests in such amounts (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such participations were outstanding) in like funds as received; , , that if such payment received by any RL Lenders is required to be returned, the RL Lenders who received previous distributions in respect of their participating interests therein will return to the respective RL Lenders any portion thereof previously so distributed to them in like funds as such payment is required to be returned by the respective RL Lenders.

(h) All determinations by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 1.17 shall be made by it in accordance with the provisions herein and with the intent being to equitably share the credit risk for all Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit hereunder in accordance with the provisions hereof. Absent manifest error, all determinations by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be binding on the Borrowers and each of the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Borrower or any Lender hereunder for any determinations made by it hereunder (other than any determination as to the existence of a Sharing Event), except to the extent resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

increased costs shall be calculated without regard to Section 1.13, Section 13.04(a) or the last sentence of Section 13.04(b) and (ii) each RL Lender which has sold such participations shall be entitled to receive from the relevant Borrower indemnification from and against any and all taxes imposed as a result of the sale of the participations pursuant to this Section 1.17. The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that, upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event and after giving effect to the requirements of this Section 1.17, increased Taxes may be owing by them pursuant to Section 4.04, which Taxes shall be paid (to the extent provided in Section 4.04) by the respective Borrowers, without any claim that the increased Taxes are not payable because the same resulted from the participations effected as otherwise required by this Section 1.17.

(c) Each Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions and subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to file any certificate or document or to furnish any information as reasonably requested by the respective Borrower pursuant to any applicable treaty, law or regulation if the making of such filing or the furnishing of such information would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any additional amounts payable by the respective Borrower and would not, in the sole discretion of such Lender, be disadvantageous to such Lender.
