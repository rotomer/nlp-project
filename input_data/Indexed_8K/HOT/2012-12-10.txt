Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 5, 2012, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, on behalf of themselves and the representatives of the underwriters named therein (collectively, the "Underwriters"). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase for resale to the public, $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.125% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Notes"). The offering of the Notes was completed on December 10, 2012.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of December 10, 2012 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated as of December 10, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), each between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee.
The Notes are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2013.
The Company may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at its option at any time or from time to time prior to November 15, 2022 (three months prior to the maturity date of the notes) at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
 
 
At any time on or after November 15, 2022 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), the Company may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
In addition, if a Change of Control (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in the foregoing paragraphs, holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their Notes for payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase.
The Notes were sold to the Underwriters at an issue price of 98.946% of the principal amount thereof, and the Underwriters offered the Notes to the public at a price of 99.596% of the principal amount thereof. The net proceeds of the offering to the Company were approximately $346 million, which the Company used, together with cash on hand, to purchase approximately $544 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 7.875% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes"), 7.375% Senior Notes due 2015, 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and 7.15% Senior Notes due 2019 pursuant to the cash tender offer announced November 26, 2012, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such notes and related fees and expenses.
The Notes are being offered and sold by the Company pursuant to a registration statement (the "Registration Statement") on Form S-3 (File No. 333-185268).
Additionally, the Company received consents pursuant to its previously announced consent solicitation from the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding 2014 Notes to proposed amendments (the "Proposed Amendments") to the indenture governing the 2014 Notes (the "2014 Indenture") to reduce the minimum notice period prior to a redemption of the 2014 Notes from thirty days to three business days. The Company entered into a supplemental indenture (the "2014 Supplemental Indenture") to the 2014 Indenture on December 10, 2012 to effectuate the Proposed Amendments.

Such registration statement, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness ("Rule 430 Information"), is referred to herein as the

"Registration Statement"; and as used herein, the term "Preliminary Prospectus" means each prospectus used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omits Rule 430 Information, and the term "Prospectus" means the final prospectus and any final prospectus supplement(s) in the form first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of sales of the Securities. If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be and any reference to "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
At or prior to the time when sales of the Securities were first made (the "Time of Sale"), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively with the information referred to in the next succeeding clause, the "Time of Sale Information"): a Preliminary Prospectus dated December 5, 2012 and each "free-writing prospectus" (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act) listed on Annex D hereto as constituting part of the Time of Sale Information.

(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person.

Indemnification of the Underwriters.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the information contained in paragraphs 3 and 6 appearing under the heading "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.

Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been

sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Limitation on Liability.
pro rata
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.
8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
9. .

Termination
10. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's   share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.

Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Security executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 2.05.
Execution of Securities
 
In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Securities shall cease to be such officer before the Securities so signed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, or disposed of by the Company, such Securities nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Securities had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Security may be signed on behalf of the Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at the date of the execution of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
. Securities of any series may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of the same series of other authorized denominations. Securities to be exchanged shall be surrendered, at the option of the holders thereof, either at the office or agency designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02 or at any of such other offices or agencies as may be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02, and the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Security or Securities which the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Each person designated by the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.02 as a person authorized to register and register transfer of the Securities is sometimes herein referred to as a "Security registrar".
Section 2.06.
Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Securities
The Company shall keep, at each such office or agency, a register for each series of Securities issued hereunder (the registers of all Security registrars being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security register" or the "registry books of the Company") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register Securities and shall register the transfer of Securities as in this Article Two provided. The Security register shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times the Security registrar shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and any Security registrar other than the Trustee. Upon due presentment for registration or registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any designated office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series for an equal aggregate principal amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Security by any Security registrar in the registry books of the Company maintained by such Security registrar, and delivery of such Security, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Security.
No person shall at any time be designated as or act as a Security registrar unless such person is at such time empowered under applicable law to act as such under and to the extent required by applicable law and regulations.
All Securities presented for registration of transfer or for exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be
 
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer or exchange in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
The Company shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for the period of 15 days next preceding the selection of Securities of that series to be redeemed and thereafter until the date of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption, or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption in whole or in part except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
The provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes under this Indenture.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue its services as Depositary for such Global Security and no successor Depositary has been appointed within 90 days after such notice or (ii) ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as the Depositary and so notifies the Company, and no successor Depositary has been appointed within 90 days after such notice, (B) the Company determines at any time that the Securities shall no longer be represented by Global Securities and shall inform such Depositary of such determination and participants in such Depositary elect to withdraw their beneficial interests in the Securities from such Depositary, following notification by the Depositary of their right to do so, or (C) such exchange is made upon request by or on behalf of the Depositary in accordance with customary procedures, following the request of a Beneficial Owner seeking to exercise or enforce its rights under the Securities.
(3) Subject to clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
 
(4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
(5) Subject to the provisions of clause (7) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members (as defined below in clause (7)) and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.
(6) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (2) above, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of certificated Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons.
(7) Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary (collectively, the "") nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company or the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.
Agent Members
. In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in the case of a mutilated Security shall, and in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Security may in its discretion, execute and, upon the written request or authorization of any officer of the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless from any loss or liability which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced and subsequently presented or claimed for payment and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
Section 2.07.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities
Upon the issuance of any substituted Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may,
 
instead of issuing a substituted Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless from any loss or liability which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced and subsequently presented or claimed for payment and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
Every substituted Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.07 by virtue of the fact that any Security is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities (printed, lithographed or typewritten). Temporary Securities shall be issuable in any authorized denomination and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every such temporary Security shall be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at the option of the holders thereof, either at the office or agency to be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02 or at any of such other offices or agencies as may be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 2.08.
Temporary Securities
. All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, repayment, exchange or registration of transfer or for credit against any sinking fund shall, if surrendered to the Company, any Security registrar, any paying agent or any other agent of the Company or of the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and promptly cancelled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly cancelled by it, and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee may dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures and, upon written request of the Company, deliver a certificate of such
Section 2.09.
Cancellation of Securities Paid, etc
 
disposition to the Company or, at the written request of the Company, shall deliver cancelled Securities to the Company. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Section 2.10.
Computation of Interest
. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for the Securities evidenced thereby, every Global Security authenticated and delivered hereunder shall bear a legend in substantially the following form (or such other form as a securities exchange or Depositary may request or require):

DTC
. The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
Section 2.12.
CUSIP Numbers
provided
 
. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable, as the case may be, (i) to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity and (ii) to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series, in either case except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for Securities of such series.
Section 3.01.
Applicability of Article
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment."
. In case the Company shall desire to exercise any right to redeem all, or, as the case may be, any part of, the Securities of any series in accordance with their terms, it shall fix a date for redemption and shall deliver a notice of such redemption at least 10 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of Securities of such series so to be redeemed as a whole or in part at their last addresses as the same appear on the registry books of the Company and to the Trustee, except as the resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors to establish the terms of any series of Securities may otherwise provide. The notice shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice or any defect in the notice to the holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
Section 3.02.
Notice of Redemption; Selection of Securities
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price at which the Securities of such series are to be redeemed (or if not then ascertainable, the manner of calculation thereof), the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice and that on and after said date any interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. Where the redemption price is not ascertainable at the time the notice of redemption is given as aforesaid, the Company shall notify the Trustee of said redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall specify the number or numbers of the Securities of that series to be redeemed. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of that series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
Prior to the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 3.02, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 4.04) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities or portions thereof so called for redemption, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, (i) the
 
Company will give the Trustee notice not less than 15 days (or such shorter period as may be acceptable to the Trustee) prior to the redemption date as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and (ii)(x) if such Securities are at the time represented by a Global Security, then the Depositary shall select by lot the particular interests to be redeemed or (y) if any of such Securities are not represented by a Global Security, then the Trustee shall select or cause to be selected, in such manner as in its sole discretion it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Securities of that series or portions thereof to be redeemed. Securities of a series may be redeemed in part only in multiples of the smallest authorized denomination of that series.
. If notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 3.02 or Section 3.05, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities or portions of such Securities, together with any interest accrued to said date) any interest on the Securities of such series or portions of Securities of such series so called for redemption shall cease to accrue. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; , , that any regularly scheduled installment of interest becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date according to their terms.
Section 3.03.
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
provided
however
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
. In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of that series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or (b) receive credit for the principal amount of Securities of that series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities; that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 3.04.
Satisfaction of Mandatory Sinking Fund Payments with Securities
provided
. Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash
Section 3.05.
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
 
(which cash may be deposited with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 4.04) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.04 (which Securities, if not theretofore delivered, will accompany such certificate) and whether the Company intends to exercise its right to make a permitted optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series. Such certificate shall also state that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series. Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such certificate (or to deliver the Securities specified in this paragraph), the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date for that series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of such Securities subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the option to deliver or credit Securities as provided in Section 3.04 and without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment, if any, with respect to such series.
Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash which shall equal or exceed $100,000 or the equivalent amount in the Specified Currency (if other than Dollars) (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request or determine) with respect to the Securities of any particular series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own paying agent) on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the next sinking fund payment date following the date of such payment) to the redemption of such Securities at the redemption price specified in such Securities for operation of the sinking fund together with accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own paying agent) to the redemption of Securities shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment received by the Trustee (or if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 4.04) for such series and, together with such payment (or such amount so segregated), shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.05. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee (or if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 4.04) on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own paying agent), together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited (or segregated) sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Securities of that series at maturity.
The Trustee shall select or cause to be selected the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in the last paragraph of Section 3.02, and the Company shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the manner provided in Section 3.02 except that the notice of redemption shall also state that the Securities are being redeemed by operation of the sinking fund. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03.
 
On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee in cash (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 4.04) a sum equal to any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption of Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section.
Neither the Trustee nor the Company shall redeem any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of such Securities by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a default in payment of interest, if any, on such Securities or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to such Securities, except that if the notice of redemption of any such Securities shall theretofore have been mailed in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee (or the Company if the Company is acting as its own paying agent) shall redeem such Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee (or segregated by the Company) for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of such Securities; , , that in case such default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived as provided herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next sinking fund payment date for such Securities on which such moneys may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section.
provided
however
. Any series of Securities may be made, by provision contained in or established pursuant to a supplemental indenture or a resolution of the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof, subject to repayment, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder on a date or dates specified prior to maturity, together with accrued interest to the date of repayment, on such notice as may be required, provided, however, that the holder of a Security may only elect partial repayment in an amount that will result in the portion of such Security that will remain Outstanding after such repayment constituting an authorized denomination, or combination thereof, of such Securities.
Section 3.06.
Repayment at the Option of the Holder
. The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on each of the Securities of that series at the places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities.
Section 4.01.
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest
. As long as any of the Securities of a series remain Outstanding, the Company will designate and maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where the Securities of that series may be presented for payment, an office or agency where the Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer and for exchange as in this Indenture provided and an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series or of this Indenture may be served. In addition to such office or offices or agency or agencies, the
Section 4.02.
Offices for Notices and Payments, etc
 
Company may from time to time designate and maintain one or more additional offices or agencies within or outside the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, where the Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange, and the Company may from time to time rescind such designation, as it may deem desirable or expedient. The Company will give to the Trustee written notice of the location of each such office or agency and of any change of location thereof. In case the Company shall fail to maintain any such office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location thereof, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the principal office of the Trustee.
The Company hereby initially designates the office of the Trustee located at 400 South Hope Street, Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA 90011 as the office or agency of the Company where the Securities of each series may be presented for payment, for registration of transfer and for exchange as in this Indenture provided and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of each series or of this Indenture may be served.
. The Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 7.10, a successor trustee, so that there shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to each series of Securities hereunder.
Section 4.03.
Appointment to Fill Vacancies in Trustee's Office
. (a) If the Company shall appoint a paying agent other than the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series, it will cause such paying agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 4.04:
Section 4.04.
Provision as to Paying Agent
(1) that it will hold all sums held by it as such agent for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Company or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series;
(2) that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) to make any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series when the same shall be due and payable; and
(3) that at any time during the continuance of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) specified in the preceding paragraph (2), such paying agent will, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by it.
(b) If the Company shall act as its own paying agent with respect to the Securities of any series, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the holders of such Securities a sum sufficient to pay such principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, so becoming due and will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action and of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) to make any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series when the same shall become due and payable.
 
(c) Anything in this Section 4.04 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may, at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee all sums held in trust by it, or any paying agent hereunder, as required by this Section, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the trusts herein contained.
(d) Anything in this Section 4.04 to the contrary notwithstanding, the agreement to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section 4.04 is subject to Sections 12.05 and 12.06.
(e) Whenever the Company shall have one or more paying agents with respect to the Securities of any series, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series, deposit with a designated paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure so to act.
. The Company will furnish to the Trustee on or before May 1, in each year (beginning with the first May 1 following the first date of issuance of any Securities under this Indenture) a brief certificate (which need not comply with Section 14.05) from the principal executive, financial or accounting officer of the Company as required by Section 314(a)(4) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The Trustee shall have no duty to review, ascertain or confirm the Company's compliance with, or breach of, any representation, warranty or covenant made in this Indenture.
Section 4.05.
Statement as to Compliance
