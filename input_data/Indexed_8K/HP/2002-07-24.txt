Item 9. Other Events. On July 24, 2002, Helmerich & Payne, Inc. issued the following press release: "TULSA, OK., -- Helmerich & Payne, Inc. announced net income of $28,218,000 ($0.56 per share, on a diluted basis) from revenues of $185,467,000 for the third quarter ended June 30, 2002, compared with net income of $40,437,000 ($0.79 per share, on a diluted basis) from revenues of $217,222,000 for the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. Net income for the first nine months of this fiscal year totaled $54,694,000 ($1.09 per share, on a diluted basis) from revenues of $515,190,000, compared with net income of $116,026,000 ($2.28 per share, on a diluted basis) from revenues of $631,341,000 for the same period last year. This year's third quarter and year-to-date results include net income from the sale of investment securities of $15,468,000 ($0.30 per share) and $15,792,000 ($0.31 per share), compared to $1,423,000 and $1,497,000 ($0.03 per share) for the same periods of fiscal 2001. Contract Drilling Division Total Contract Drilling Division operating profit for the third quarter was $17,907,000, down slightly from $17,949,000 for the previous quarter, and down substantially from $38,263,000 recorded for the third quarter of last year. Third quarter operating profit for U.S. operations of $14,360,000 was a slight improvement over the previous quarter's operating profit of $13,533,000, but down from $30,305,000 recorded in last year's third quarter. Average revenue per day for the U.S. land rig fleet was $11,501 for the recent quarter, compared with $12,386 for the second quarter of this year and $15,420 for the third quarter of 2001. Average U.S. land rig utilization was 85% for the current quarter, compared with 76% for the previous quarter, and 98% for the third quarter of 2001. The average number of H&P land rigs available for work in the U.S. has increased 30%, from 44.6 rigs in the third quarter of last year, to 58.1 rigs during the third quarter of this year. The increase is due to the additional FlexRigs(TM)* constructed by the Company over the past year, as well as four rigs moved from international locations to the U.S. *FlexRig(TM) hereinafter referred to as FlexRig. 2
Revenues and profitability were flat in the Company's U.S. offshore platform rig business, even though rig utilization for the Company's fleet fell to 81% during the quarter, compared to 89% in the previous quarter, and 100% in last year's third quarter. Performance for the quarter was helped by reduced operating costs and the commencement of work for the Company's new offshore platform Rigs 205 and 206. Operating profit for the Company's international operations fell to $3,547,000 for the third quarter, compared with $4,416,000 for the previous quarter, and $7,958,000 for last year's third quarter. Rig utilization averaged 48% for the current quarter, compared with 58% in the previous quarter, and 60% in last year's third quarter. Rig activity continued to be low in all Company international locations except in Ecuador where rig utilization averaged 86% for the quarter. Rig activity in Venezuela, where the Company operates 14 of its 33 international rigs, averaged 38% for the quarter. As previously announced, the Company has begun construction of its third series of the H&P-designed FlexRig. The current series of rigs, named FlexRig3, is being assembled in the Company's construction facility in Houston. Two of the new FlexRig3s recently were deployed to the field to commence operations for customers. An additional 23 rigs are scheduled to be completed within the next 12-14 months. The next six FlexRig3s to be completed are already committed to specific customers for work. Rig utilization for all FlexRigs since 1998 have averaged over 95%. Upon the projected completion in late fiscal 2003 of the FlexRig3 project, it is estimated that the H&P land rig fleet in the U.S. will total 83 rigs, representing a 43% increase over the 58 rigs available during the recent quarter. To help finance the FlexRig3 construction and future capital requirements, the Company is currently negotiating a $200,000,000 intermediate term debt facility. This facility will provide for staged maturities from 5 to 12 years. The Company expects to finalize this facility in mid August 2002. To provide short-term financial flexibility, the Company recently sold a portion of its stock portfolio, generating $36,819,000 of gross proceeds, and also increased its revolving bank lines of credit to a total of $175,000,000. The Company currently has bank borrowings of $50,000,000 and its remaining stock portfolio has a market value of approximately $170,000,000. 3
Oil and Gas Division As announced on February 25, 2002, the Company and Key Production Company, Inc. (Key) have signed a definitive agreement that provides for Helmerich & Payne, Inc. to spin off its Oil and Gas Division to its shareholders and for the newly spun company to combine with Key. The combined company, named Cimarex Energy Co., will be a new publicly traded exploration and production company. The boards of directors of H&P and Key have each unanimously approved the contemplated transaction. The transaction will close after receipt of necessary Key shareholder and regulatory approvals, including the receipt of a favorable letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. Closing will likely occur prior to the end of the Company's fiscal year (September 30, 2002). Approval of the transaction by H&P's shareholders will not be required. Subject to a favorable IRS ruling, it is anticipated that the transaction will be tax free to H&P and will be tax deferred to the shareholders of H&P and Key. Application will be made for Cimarex shares to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. During the third quarter, the Company's Oil and Gas Division recorded improved operating profit over the previous quarter of this year, but significantly lower than recorded for last year's third quarter. Operating profit for the current quarter was $8,540,000, compared with $3,985,000 during the previous quarter, and $24,083,000 during last year's third quarter. The average price received for the Company's natural gas production was $2.94 per mcf during the recent quarter, compared with $2.05 in the previous quarter, and $4.27 per mcf for last year's third quarter. Oil prices averaged $24.34 per barrel during the recent quarter, compared with $20.11 during the previous quarter, both down from the $26.12 per barrel received for Company oil production during last year's third quarter. Production volumes were flat in both natural gas and oil compared with the previous quarter, but were down in both categories compared with the third quarter of last year. Operating profit for this quarter improved over last quarter due primarily to the improvement in natural gas prices, even though dry hole, depreciation and depletion expenses were up over the previous quarter. Additionally, there was an impairment charge on producing properties for the quarter of $2,464,000. 4
Outlook Guidance for Helmerich & Payne, Inc.'s net income for fiscal year 2002 remains the same as that announced previously. Net income for the year is anticipated to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.10 per share, exclusive of the $0.31 per share net income recorded for gains from the sale of equity securities. This year's earnings guidance assumes a full year of income from the Company's Oil and Gas Division. Company President and C.E.O., Hans Helmerich commented, "Although industry conditions remain soft at this point, we continue to be encouraged by the market's response to the planned spin/merge and the selection of Key Production Company as Cimarex's merger partner. Additionally, recent field performance data are confirming reasons why the H&P FlexRig is in high demand and underscores our enthusiasm for the FlexRig3 construction program." Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP/NYSE) is an energy-oriented company engaged in contract drilling and oil and gas exploration and production. Currently, H&P has 60 U.S. land rigs, 12 U.S. platform rigs located in the Gulf of Mexico, and 33 rigs located in South America. Of the 60 U.S. land rigs currently available, 20 are the H&P-designed FlexRig. The Company is scheduled to complete the construction of an additional 23 FlexRigs to be put in service over the next 12 to 14 months.
