Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. On September 5, 2002, Helmerich & Payne, Inc. issued the following press release: "TULSA, OK., - Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (the "Company") announced today that the Securities and Exchange Commission had recently declared effective the Registration Statement of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Cimarex Energy Co. ("Cimarex"). The Registration Statement relates to the shares of Cimarex stock to be issued in the merger with Key Production Company, Inc. (NYSE - KP). Proxy Statements and Prospectuses have been mailed to Key Production shareholders with the vote regarding the merger scheduled for September 20. If approved by the Key shareholders, the spin-off of Cimarex and its merger with Key is expected to occur on September 30, 2002. Cimarex has applied for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and if accepted, will trade under the symbol XEC. The Company also gave earnings guidance for its next fiscal year ending September 30, 2003. Currently the Company's rig fleet includes 64 U.S. land rigs, 12 offshore platform rigs, and 33 international land rigs. Average rig utilizations for those respective markets are currently 88%, 58% and 36%. Average revenue per day in those respective markets for the third quarter ended June 30, 2002 were $11,500, $28,591, and $19,911. The Company estimates that FY 2003 net income could range between $0.90 and a $1.00 per share and EBITDA could range from $3.20 to $3.35 per share given the following assumptions. U.S. land rig revenue per day will not increase appreciably until the Company's third quarter ending June 30, 2003 when revenue per day would average $13,000, and increase to an average of $14,000 per day during the fourth quarter. The Company also plans to complete construction of 17 FlexRigs(TM)* during 2003. Given these estimates, average U.S. land rig revenue per day for all of 2003 would average $12,600, representing a 9.6% increase over the actual average revenue per day for the third quarter of 2002. The average U.S. land rig utilization assumption is 86% for the year. Earnings guidance also assumes an improvement in offshore platform rig utilization during the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Utilization would rise from 50% in the first two quarters to 60% in the third quarter and 66% in the fourth *FlexRig(TM) hereinafter referred to as FlexRig. 2
quarter. Average revenue per day is estimated to remain flat. In the Company's international operations, utilization is expected to be flat during the first half of the year and rise in the third and fourth periods, averaging 49% for 2003. No appreciable change in average international revenue per day is anticipated. Should industry and Company results not improve from current levels, Company earnings would be closer to $0.60 per share. In addition to releasing earnings guidance, the Company announced that its capital expenditures for fiscal year 2003 are estimated to be approximately $195 million, which includes approximately $100 million for the completion of 17 FlexRigs during the year. Additionally, the Company now has completed its arrangement of a total of $200 million of privately placed medium term notes. The medium term note program consists of four series with maturity terms of 5, 7, 10 and 12 years. The 5 and 7 year notes are $25 million each, while the 10 and 12 year maturities are $75 million each. For the entire $200 million placement, the weighted average interest rate is 6.3%, with a weighted average maturity of 9.75 years. As previously announced, the Company also liquidated a portion of its investment portfolio, generating proceeds of approximately of $41 million for 2002. President and C.E.O., Hans Helmerich commented, "The performance of the Company's FlexRig technology in the field, underscored by FlexRig utilization rates of close to 100%, are clear indicators of the value they add to our customers' operations. We are also excited about the greater visibility the Company will have as a stand-alone drilling company following the spin-off of Cimarex". Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP/NYSE) is an energy-oriented company engaged in contract drilling and oil and gas exploration and production. Currently, H&P has 64 U.S. land rigs, 12 U.S. platform rigs located in the Gulf of Mexico, and 33 rigs located in South America. Of the 64 U.S. land rigs currently available, 24 are the H&P-designed FlexRig. The Company is scheduled to complete the construction of an additional 19 FlexRigs to be put in service over the next 12 to 14 months.
