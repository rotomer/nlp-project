The final spin-off ratio will be determined after the record date. Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares in the spin-off. In the merger, holders of Key common stock will receive one share of Cimarex common stock for each share of Key common stock. The NYSE has advised Helmerich & Payne that sellers of Helmerich & Payne common stock "regular way" on the NYSE on or after September 25, 2002 and prior to October 1, 2002 will be required to provide due bills and deliver the Cimarex common stock they receive in the spin-off to the purchasers of such Helmerich & Payne common stock.

Shareholders are encouraged to consult with their financial advisors regarding the trading policies and practices of the NYSE relating to the Cimarex spin-off.
