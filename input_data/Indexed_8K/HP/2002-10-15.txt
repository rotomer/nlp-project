ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS On September 30, 2002, Helmerich & Payne, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Helmerich & Payne"), distributed to its stockholders 26,591,321 shares of common stock, together with the associated preferred stock purchase rights, of its wholly-owned subsidiary Cimarex Energy Co., a Delaware corporation ("Cimarex"), representing all of the shares of Cimarex owned by Helmerich & Payne. As a result of the distribution, Helmerich & Payne and Cimarex are no longer affiliated entities. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (b) Pro Forma Financial Information Introduction The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet and statements of income are based on the historical consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Helmerich & Payne and reflect the spinoff of its Oil and Gas Division as if the spinoff occurred on June 30, 2002 for purposes of the pro forma balance sheet and as of October 1, 2001 for purposes of the pro forma statements of income. The spinoff of Cimarex actually occurred on September 30, 2002, and therefore the actual consolidated financial statements of Helmerich & Payne will include the results of Cimarex until that date. The following unaudited pro forma financial information of the Oil and Gas Division is based on its historical balances reflected within Helmerich & Payne's historical financial statements, which utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities. In Cimarex's separate financial statements, Cimarex uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities, and therefore such balances are not comparable to those of the Oil and Gas Division presented below. Also, general corporate overhead costs previously absorbed by the Oil and Gas Division are not reflected in the Oil and Gas Division pro forma financial information below, but such costs are presented as part of the pro forma Helmerich & Payne financial information. The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the spinoff had been consummated on the dates and in accordance with the assumptions described herein, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position. You are urged to read the financial information below, along with Helmerich & Payne's publicly available historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. 2
