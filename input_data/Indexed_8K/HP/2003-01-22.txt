Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. On January 22, 2003, Helmerich & Payne, Inc. issued the following press release: "TULSA, OK., -- Helmerich & Payne, Inc. reported net income of $607,000 ($0.01 per share, on a diluted basis) from revenues of $107,327,000 for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2002, compared with net income from continuing operations of $18,127,000 ($0.36 per share, on a diluted basis) from revenues of $134,992,000 during its first fiscal quarter of 2002. First quarter contract drilling operating profit declined to $8,034,000, from $31,693,000 recorded during last year's first quarter and from $14,760,000 recorded for last year's fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2002. Operating profits were lower for both domestic and international operations as rig activity and profit margins declined. Operating profit for the Company's domestic operations was $8,626,000 during the first quarter, compared with $27,816,000 and $13,472,000 during last year's first and fourth quarters, respectively. Total land rig utilizations fell to 79%, from 89% and 85% for last year's first and fourth quarters. Average land rig revenue per day for the first quarter was $11,316, compared with $14,192 for last year's first quarter and down slightly from $11,602 for last year's fourth quarter. U.S. land rig direct costs were $8,481 per day, down from $8,549 per day the previous quarter. However, costs were higher than forecasted for the quarter for FlexRig3 training and other associated start-up costs. Direct land rig costs were impacted by an above average number of rig days lost to weather and other delays. Utilization for the Company's 12 offshore platform rigs fell to 52% for the first quarter this year, from 100% and 65% for last year's first and fourth quarters. The Company's international contract drilling operations reported an operating loss of $592,000 for this year's first quarter, compared with operating profits of $3,877,000 and $1,288,000 for last year's first and fourth quarters. International rig utilization fell to 33% for the first quarter, compared with 55% and 43% for last year's first and fourth quarters. International revenue and profit margins declined during the quarter due to reduced rig activity in all South American locations except Ecuador where rig utilization averaged 98% for the 8 rigs located there. 2
In Venezuela, where 14 of the Company's 33 international land rigs are located, an average of two rigs worked during the quarter. Presently, there are five rigs working for the Venezuelan government-owned oil company (PDVSA), with two additional rigs contracted and waiting for drilling location preparations to be completed. The location completions have been delayed due to material shortages caused by Venezuela's well-publicized workers' strike. The Company's general and administrative costs were higher due primarily to increased pension and hospitalization expenses. Interest expense also increased as a result of the $200,000,000 privately placed term notes issued in August ($100,000,000) and October ($100,000,000). Company President and CEO, Hans Helmerich commented, `We are surprised by the current softness in demand for contract drilling services worldwide. Significantly higher commodity prices and improved industry fundamentals, particularly for natural gas, signal better drilling economics that should soon translate into higher rig activity in the U.S.' Although the Company expects rig activity and profitability to improve in the future, it is difficult to predict if, when, and to what extent a possible improvement would be reflected in Company earnings. As a baseline for guidance, the Company believes that, should no changes occur relating to U.S. land and offshore platform rig utilizations, and with the current rig activity in South America, second quarter net income could be $0.05 per share. Third and fourth quarter net income could be $0.07 and $0.09 per share, respectively, as more FlexRigs commence operations in the field. This estimate of additional earnings assumes no material improvement in other variables such as dayrates, margins and utilizations except in Colombia where one rig is expected to begin work next month, and in Venezuela where the two contracted, but currently idle rigs are assumed to be operating by early to mid third quarter. These estimates assume no other financial impact from possible disruption in the Company's Venezuelan operations. The Company owns a portfolio of publicly held stocks with a total market value of approximately $180,000,000 with a financial cost basis of $105,000,000. The Company owns 286,528 shares of Transocean, Inc., obtained as a result of the spin-off of Schlumberger's offshore drilling company and its simultaneous merger with Transocean in 1999. Currently, the market value of the stock is approximately $21.00 per 3
share with a financial basis of $33.19 per share. Should its value remain below the cost basis during the fiscal year, the Company will likely be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to its income statement prior to year end. Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP/NYSE) is a contract drilling company that owns 72 U.S. land rigs, 12 U.S. platform rigs located in the Gulf of Mexico, and 33 rigs located in South America, or a total of 117 rigs. Of the 72 U.S. land rigs currently available, 32 are the H&P-designed FlexRig(TM)*. The Company is scheduled to complete the construction of an additional 11 FlexRigs to be put in service over the next six months.
