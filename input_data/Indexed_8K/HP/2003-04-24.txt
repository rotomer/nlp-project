EXHIBIT 99.1 APRIL 24, 2003 HELMERICH & PAYNE ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS TULSA, OK. -- HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. ANNOUNCED NET INCOME OF $2,574,000 ($0.05 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM REVENUES OF $126,320,000 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2003, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $8,129,000 ($0.16 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM REVENUES OF $132,344,000 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. NET INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THIS FISCAL YEAR TOTALED $3,181,000 ($0.06 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM REVENUES OF $239,633,000, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $26,256,000 ($0.52 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM REVENUES OF $276,227,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. LAST YEAR'S NET INCOME FROM CIMAREX ENERGY CO. (THE COMPANY'S FORMER EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY THAT WAS SPUN OFF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002) IS REPORTED AS INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF AN ADDITIONAL $0.06 AND $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 2002. TOTAL SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME FOR THE COMPANY WAS DOWN COMPARED TO LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER DUE TO HIGHER DEPRECIATION, INTEREST AND G&A EXPENSES, LOWER DAYRATES AND MARGINS IN THE COMPANY'S U.S. LAND RIG BUSINESS, AND LOWER RIG UTILIZATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S U.S. OFFSHORE PLATFORM AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES. SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME WAS UP SEQUENTIALLY DUE TO REDUCED COSTS IN THE COMPANY'S U.S. LAND RIG OPERATIONS, IMPROVED MARGINS IN ITS U.S. PLATFORM RIG BUSINESS, AND IMPROVED UTILIZATION IN ITS INTERNATIONAL LAND RIG OPERATIONS. (SEE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIALS FOR SPECIFIC OPERATING STATISTICS.) IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL RIG BUSINESS, ADDITIONAL RIGS WORKING IN VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA HELPED PUSH RIG UTILIZATION AND OPERATING PROFITS UP SLIGHTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS QUARTER. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FIVE RIGS WORKING IN ITS VENEZUELA OPERATION, ONE IN COLOMBIA, SEVEN IN ECUADOR, ONE IN BOLIVIA, AND A LABOR CONTRACT OFFSHORE EQUATORIAL GUINEA. THE COMPANY PLANS DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER TO SEND ONE LAND RIG FROM ITS U.S. FLEET TO HUNGARY ON A SHORT-TERM CONTRACT. THE COMPANY ALSO RECENTLY SOLD THREE SMALL INACTIVE RIGS LOCATED IN THE LAKE MARACAIBO REGION OF VENEZUELA. TOTAL DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WAS $19,943,000, COMPARED WITH $15,046,000 FOR LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER AND $18,236,000 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2003. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY TWO FLEXRIGS(TM)* EACH MONTH SINCE JUNE 2002. THE COMPANY INCURRED HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER AND THE PREVIOUS QUARTER DUE TO THE PLACEMENT OF $200,000,000 OF INTERMEDIATE TERM DEBT, HALF OF WHICH WAS PLACED ON AUGUST 15, 2002, AND THE OTHER HALF PLACED ON OCTOBER 15, 2002. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE HIGHER IN THE CURRENT YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER MAINLY DUE TO INCREASES IN PENSION AND HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS, AND UP SEQUENTIALLY DUE TO HIGHER PAYROLL AND ASSOCIATED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS. *FLEXRIG(TM) HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS FLEXRIG (OVER)
PAGE 2 APRIL 24, 2003 NEWS RELEASE COMPANY PRESIDENT AND C.E.O., HANS HELMERICH COMMENTED, "AT THE END OF THE QUARTER, INDUSTRY RIG COUNTS WERE FINALLY RESPONDING TO THE STRONG NATURAL GAS FUNDAMENTALS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT BETTER COST CONTAINMENT AND IMPROVING DAYRATES WILL ADD TO OUR OPERATING MARGINS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SOFTNESS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO PLATFORM MARKET AND THE INTERNATIONAL DRILLING MARKETS HAMPER EARNINGS AS THEY WILL BE SLOWER TO RECOVER." THE COMPANY DID NOT ALTER THE EARNINGS GUIDANCE IT PROVIDED THE PREVIOUS QUARTER, WHICH WAS FOR ONLY SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN EARNINGS FOR ITS THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS. HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. (HP/NYSE) IS A CONTRACT DRILLING COMPANY THAT OWNS 78 U.S. LAND RIGS, 12 U.S. PLATFORM RIGS LOCATED IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, AND 31 INTERNATIONAL LAND RIGS, OR A TOTAL OF 121 RIGS. OF THE 78 U.S. LAND RIGS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, 38 ARE H&P-DESIGNED FLEXRIGS. THE COMPANY IS SCHEDULED TO COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ADDITIONAL FOUR FLEXRIGS TO BE PUT IN SERVICE BY JUNE 2003.
