EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99 NOVEMBER 12, 2003 HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. ANNOUNCES EARNINGS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 TULSA, OK - HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. ANNOUNCED NET INCOME OF $18,730,000 ($0.37 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM REVENUES OF $515,284,000 FOR ITS FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR WAS $53,706,000 ($1.07 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM REVENUES OF $551,879,000. NET INCOME INCLUDES GAINS FROM THE SALE OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES OF $0.07 PER SHARE FOR 2003, AND $0.30 PER SHARE FOR 2002. NET INCOME ALSO INCLUDES A LOSS OF $0.01 PER SHARE, AND NET INCOME OF $0.06 PER SHARE FOR 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF LOSSES AND INCOME FROM ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME WAS $7,387,000 ($0.15 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM REVENUES OF $138,626,000, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $4,899,000 ($0.10 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM REVENUES OF $123,603,000 FOR LAST YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER. INCLUDED IN FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME WERE GAINS FROM THE SALE OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES OF $0.06 PER SHARE FOR 2003, AND A LOSS OF $0.01 IN 2002. NET INCOME ALSO INCLUDES A LOSS OF $0.02 PER SHARE, AND INCOME OF $0.01 PER SHARE FOR FOURTH QUARTER 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF LOSSES AND INCOME FROM ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. LAST YEAR'S NET INCOME FROM THE COMPANY'S FORMER EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY THAT WAS SPUN OFF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 IS REPORTED AS INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF AN ADDITIONAL $0.07 AND $0.19 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE THREE AND TWELVE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. TOTAL OPERATING PROFIT AND NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S CURRENT YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER WERE UP COMPARED TO LAST YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER, BUT DECLINED COMPARED TO THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2003. COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS QUARTER, FOURTH QUARTER OPERATING PROFIT, AND REVENUE AND MARGIN PER RIG DAY DECLINED IN ALL THREE OF THE COMPANY'S CONTRACT DRILLING BUSINESS SEGMENTS, WHILE OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED IN ITS REAL ESTATE SEGMENT DUE TO A GAIN FROM THE SALE OF UNDEVELOPED LAND. FOURTH QUARTER RIG UTILIZATIONS WERE FLAT TO DOWN IN ALL OF THE CONTRACT DRILLING BUSINESS SEGMENTS, COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS QUARTER. FOURTH QUARTER OPERATING PROFIT INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION OF EARLY TERMINATION EARNINGS IN THE COMPANY'S OFFSHORE PLATFORM RIG SEGMENT. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, ONE OFFSHORE PLATFORM RIG WAS STACKED AND TWO RIGS THAT WERE WORKING AT FULL DAYRATE WHILE STILL ON CONTRACT WERE CHANGED TO STANDBY STATUS. CONSEQUENTLY, AVERAGE DAILY U.S. OFFSHORE PLATFORM RIG REVENUE AND PROFIT MARGIN WILL DECLINE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, WHICH WILL LIKELY REDUCE OPERATING PROFIT OF THE U.S. OFFSHORE PLATFORM RIG SEGMENT BY 50% FROM THAT OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003. COMPANY PRESIDENT AND C.E.O., HANS HELMERICH COMMENTED; "WHILE INDUSTRY RIG COUNTS BEGAN TO IMPROVE IN THE LATTER PART OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO BRING A POSITIVE LIFT TO DAYRATES. IN FACT, THE RATE OF IMPROVEMENT SEEMED TO STALL DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, CAUSING THE SLIGHTLY LOWER RESULTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER. AS ANTICIPATED, OUR 2003 RESULTS WERE DOWN CONSIDERABLY FROM 2002. (OVER)
PAGE 2 NOVEMBER 12, 2003 NEWS RELEASE MUCH HAS BEEN SAID AND WRITTEN THIS PAST YEAR ABOUT THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN HIGH OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES AND THE TEPID OILFIELD ACTIVITY. NEVERTHELESS, THE FUNDAMENTALS FOR IMPROVEMENT ARE SETTING UP FOR 2004 AND BEYOND. ENERGY PRICES CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER SPENDING AND POSITIVE REPORTS CONCERNING ECONOMIC RECOVERY POINT TO INCREASING DEMAND. A NORMAL WINTER WOULD PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT BOOST TO ACCELERATING NATURAL GAS DRILLING IN THE U.S., PARTICULARLY ON LAND. ALSO, WE HAVE BEGUN TO EXPERIENCE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN OUR INTERNATIONAL RIG ACTIVITY. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW FAR INTO 2004 IT WILL TAKE TO ACHIEVE POSITIVE TRACTION, BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED AS A COMPANY TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN ANY UNFOLDING UP-CYCLE." REPORTING CHANGES AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE COMPANY'S METHODOLOGY OF REPORTING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES HAS BEEN CHANGED, WHICH SHOULD AID IN ANALYZING THE COMPANY. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION 1) THE NUMBER OF CONTRACT DRILLING BUSINESS SEGMENTS REPORTED HAVE INCREASED TO THREE TO REFLECT THE COMPANY'S U.S. OFFSHORE PLATFORM OPERATIONS SEPARATELY FROM THE U.S. LAND RIG OPERATIONS. FORMERLY, THE COMBINED U.S. SEGMENTS WERE REPORTED AS ONE SEGMENT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TOTAL OPERATING INCOME FOR U.S. OPERATIONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONTRACT DRILLING SEGMENT HAS NOT CHANGED. U.S. LAND AND OFFSHORE PLATFORM RIG SEGMENTS HAVE SIMPLY BEEN SEPARATED. 2) EXPENSES WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CONTRACT DRILLING BUSINESS SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN BROKEN OUT TO DELINEATE DIRECT OPERATING COSTS FROM ASSOCIATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. FORMERLY, BOTH COSTS WERE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT REPORTING CALCULATIONS BUT NOT SHOWN OR BROKEN OUT SEPARATELY. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME 3) SEGMENT-RELATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN OPERATING COSTS HAVE NOW BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE RECLASSIFICATION IS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING SHOWN AS ALLOCATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. NO OTHER NUMBERS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME WERE CHANGED OR AFFECTED BY THIS RECLASSIFICATION. (MORE)
PAGE 3 NOVEMBER 12, 2003 NEWS RELEASE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SEPARATION OF THE U.S. LAND AND U.S. OFFSHORE PLATFORM SEGMENTS, THE COMPANY MADE MINOR CHANGES TO ITS METHOD OF ALLOCATING COSTS BETWEEN THOSE SEGMENTS.
