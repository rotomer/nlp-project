ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
     On January 22, 2004, Helmerich & Payne, Inc. ("Registrant") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first quarter ended December 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99 to this Report on Form 8-K. This information is being furnished pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: January 22, 2004

 
Exhibit 99 January 22, 2004
     
Helmerich & Payne, Inc. reported net income of $5,629,000 ($0.11 per diluted share) from revenues of $138,894,000 for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003, compared with net income of $607,000 ($0.01 per diluted share) from revenues of $113,313,000 during last year's first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2002. Net income for this year's first quarter includes $2,098,000 ($.04 per share) of gains (net of tax) from the sale of portfolio securities. There were no portfolio sales in last year's first quarter.
     
Operating profits from the Company's U.S. land and international segments were improved over both last year's first and fourth quarters, but U.S. offshore platform rig operating profit for the first quarter was substantially lower, compared to either first or fourth quarter of last year. As announced in November 2003, the reduction in U.S. offshore platform rig performance was primarily the result of one rig being stacked and two rigs going from full dayrate to standby status. No significant change in U.S. offshore platform results is anticipated for the second quarter; however, the Company has reached an agreement with a large independent for H&P platform Rig 100 to return to work in the Gulf of Mexico in March 2004.
     
First quarter U.S. land rig operating profit increased significantly from first quarter of last year due to 25% more revenue days as well as lower field and general and administrative costs. Compared with the previous quarter, first quarter U.S. land rig operating profit was up slightly because lower depreciation and higher revenue per rig day more than offset the effects of slightly lower rig utilization and revenue days.
     
International operating profit improved from last year's first and fourth quarters as a result of additional rig revenue days and improved profitability in Venezuela, Argentina, and Hungary. The Company also recently received government approval to convert its bolivar cash balances in Venezuelan banks to U.S. dollars and to remit those dollars in the form of a subsidiary dividend to the parent Company's U.S. bank account. The dividend of approximately $8.8 million U.S. dollars, which was transferred to the U.S. last week, substantially reduces the Company's current exposure to potential devaluation loss. The Company has also received a contract to put an eighth H&P rig to work in Venezuela commencing in February 2004.
     
Real Estate operating profit returned to a more normal level of $1.3 million for this year's first quarter, compared with last year's fourth quarter operating profit of $3.2 million, which included the sale of approximately 15 acres of raw land that generated $2.2 million of pre-tax operating profit.

Company President and C.E.O., Hans Helmerich commented, "As we expected, our net income this quarter was negatively affected by the drop in offshore platform operating profit. At the same time, we are encouraged by the positive industry fundamentals of an increasing U.S. land rig count, strong commodity prices, and signs of improvement in our international business."
