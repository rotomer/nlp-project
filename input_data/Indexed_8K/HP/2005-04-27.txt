SIGNATURES
      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly authorized the undersigned to sign this report on its behalf.

 
Exhibit 99
April 27, 2005
      
Helmerich & Payne, Inc. reported net income of $22,350,000 ($0.43 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $185,450,000 for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005, compared with net income of $6,048,000 ($0.12 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $143,024,000 during last year's second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004. Included in net income were gains from the sale of portfolio securities and drilling equipment of $0.01 per share for this year's second quarter and $0.09 per share for last year's second quarter.
      
For the six months ended March 31, 2005, the Company reported net income of $61,660,000 ($1.20 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $360,129,000, compared with net income of $12,636,000 ($0.25 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $277,297,000 during the first six months ended March 31, 2004. Included in net income were gains from the sale of portfolio securities and drilling equipment of $0.45 per share for the first six months of fiscal 2005 and $0.16 per share for the first six months of fiscal 2004.
      
Company President and CEO, Hans Helmerich commented, "The U.S. land business continues to improve, fueled by strong energy prices. Customers are paying more for rigs across the board and are particularly attracted to the consistent performance and added drilling efficiency that our fleet offers. During the second quarter, cash margins for our U.S. land fleet increased by $1,381 over the previous quarter, driving operating income up by 40% during that same period.
      
As expected, our U.S. platform business was steady during the second quarter, while our international segment results were hampered by a $1,555,000 Venezuelan currency revaluation expense, reduction in operating income in Bolivia and Equatorial Guinea, and expenses associated with terminating operations in Chad and Hungary."
      
As previously announced on March 23rd, the Company has been contracted by Williams Production RMT Company to operate 10 new FlexRig4s, each under three-year term contracts at a fixed dayrate plus certain conditional incentive payments based upon savings realized by Williams. The first rig is scheduled for completion by November 2005, with the remaining nine expected to be delivered to the field at the rate of one per month thereafter.
      
The Company announced today that it had received a letter of intent from ConocoPhillips to operate three new FlexRig4 drilling rigs. ConocoPhillips will contract the new FlexRig4s on three-year term contracts for work in the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico. The Company expects to deliver one new rig per month starting November 2005. The new rigs and transportation equipment are expected to cost the Company approximately $9.5 million each.
      
Mr. Helmerich added, "We are pleased to be awarded the contract resulting in the construction of three new FlexRig4 rigs for ConocoPhillips. This work represents further validation of the FlexRig's superior field performance and drilling efficiencies. Building on strong customer satisfaction with our existing 50 FlexRigs, these new FlexRig4s will provide enhanced project economics for the customer and allow us to secure term contracts with attractive financial returns for our shareholders."
