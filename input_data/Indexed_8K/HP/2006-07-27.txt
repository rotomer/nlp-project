Exhibit 99
July 27, 2006
Helmerich & Payne, Inc. reported record net income of $79,975,000 ($0.75 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $319,796,000 for its third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2006, compared with net income of $29,825,000 ($0.28 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $207,387,000 during last year's third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005.  Included in net income were gains from the sale of portfolio securities and drilling equipment of $0.06 per share for the third fiscal quarter of 2006 and $0.01 per share for the third fiscal quarter of 2005.
For the nine months ended June 30, 2006, the Company reported net income of $195,362,000 ($1.84 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $866,014,000 compared with net income of $91,485,000 ($0.88 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $567,516,000 during the first nine months ended June 30, 2005.  Included in net income were gains from the sale of portfolio securities and drilling equipment of $0.11 per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2006, and $0.23 per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2005.
This year's third quarter segment operating income increased in all of the Company's contract drilling
business segments compared with both last year's third quarter and this year's second quarter.  The most significant impact came from the U.S. land operations with segment operating income totaling $93,708,000 for the third quarter, up 13% from the previous quarter and up 98% from last year's third quarter.  The segment also reported an 8% increase in total activity days as compared to the previous quarter, which is primarily attributable to the Company's deployment of new FlexRigs under its new build construction program.  Third quarter U.S. land average rig margins per day rose by $371 over the previous quarter, from $12,567 to $12,938 per day.  Third quarter average rig revenue reached an all time high of $23,503 per day.  (See attached financial reports for additional operating statistics.)
The Company's U.S. offshore operations reported $7,635,000 of segment operating income for the third quarter, up 4% from the previous quarter and up 64% from last year's third quarter.  Higher management contract profitability and continued increase in rig activity contributed to improved earnings for the quarter.
In the international operations, the Company reported segment operating income of $17,685,000 for the third quarter, up 35% from the previous quarter and up 235% from last year's third quarter.  The sequential increase was due primarily to improved dayrates and margins.  As previously announced, the Company expects to begin drilling operations in Tunisia with a new FlexRig3 during the first fiscal quarter of 2007.

Company President and C.E.O., Hans Helmerich commented, "Even with the uncertainty surrounding natural gas prices, rig demand remains strong and customers are increasingly focused on safety, performance and cost reducing drilling technology.  The Company's increasing FlexRig activity will add substantial leverage to our earnings going forward, even if rig margin growth continues to moderate.  As of today, we have deployed 15 of the 66 previously announced new FlexRigs, and an additional nine are scheduled to be completed by September 30, 2006.  Although we expect to continue to face production schedule and capital cost challenges, we anticipate our overall new build returns to remain strong."
Helmerich & Payne, Inc. is a contract drilling company that owns 104 U.S. land rigs, 11 U.S. platform rigs located in the Gulf of Mexico, and 27 international rigs, for a total of 142 rigs. Included in the total fleet of 142 rigs are 65 H&P-designed and operated FlexRigs.  In addition, 51 new FlexRigs are scheduled to be completed and deployed during the remainder of 2006 and 2007.

Segment operating income for all segments is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's performance, as it excludes general and administrative expenses, corporate depreciation, income from asset sales and other corporate income and expense.  The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company's core businesses.  This measure is used by the Company for planning and budgeting purposes and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company's reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods.  The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers.  Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons.  However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company's operating performance in future periods.
The following table reconciles segment operating income per the information above to income before income taxes and equity in income of affiliates as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands).
