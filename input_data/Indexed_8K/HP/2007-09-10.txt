(ii)
                       
A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such electronic transmission, provided that any such means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined
4

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; , , that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall be open to the examination

(b)

Section 12.
                           
Conduct of Meetings
.  Whenever the vote of stockholders at a meeting thereof is required or permitted to be taken in connection with any corporate action, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with to the extent permitted by law, if all the stockholders who would have been entitled to vote upon the action if such meeting were held shall consent in writing to such corporate action being taken and such written consents are delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.  Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  A minute of any such corporate action consented to in writing by all the stockholders shall be inserted in the records of the Corporation as of the date such action was taken.

Corporation with such minute.  Any stockholder seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall request a record date in accordance with Section 10(b) hereof.
DIRECTORS
.  The number of Directors which shall constitute the entire Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three nor more than 15 Directors, the exact number of which shall from time to time be fixed by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.  If the number of Directors is increased, as provided above or otherwise pursuant to law, such increase shall be deemed to create vacancies to be filled as provided in Section 6.  A decrease in the number of Directors shall not effect the term of office of any Director then in office.  Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an annual meeting of stockholders and each Director so elected shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such Director has been chosen and until such Director's successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until such Director's earlier death, resignation or removal.
Section 1.
                                 
Number and Election of Directors
.

No Officer of the Corporation, other than a person who is or has been Chairman of the Board or President, shall become nor may remain a member of the Board of Directors after ceasing to be an officer.  Directors need not be stockholders.  The Board of Directors may by a resolution passed by a two-thirds vote of the entire Board of Directors waive the qualifications
Section 2.
                                 
Qualification
10
set forth in this Section 2 with respect to any director if the Board of Directors determines that such action is in the best interests of the Corporation.
.  The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes:  one class of Directors composed of three Directors and known as the First Class shall be those Directors elected for a three-year term at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held March 5, 1980; another class of Directors composed of three Directors and known as the Second Class shall be those Directors elected for a three-year term at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held March 1, 1978; and another class of Directors composed of three Directors and known as the Third Class shall be those Directors elected for a three-year term at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held March 7, 1979, and one additional Director elected at the Special Meeting of the Board of Directors held May 13, 1980, as the third member of the Third Class.  Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third the total number of Directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.  Except as otherwise provided for filling vacancies, the Directors of the Corporation shall be elected by class at the annual meeting of stockholders to serve for a three-year term and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.  Vacancies in any class that occur prior to the expiration of the then current term of such class if filled by the Board of Directors shall be filled for the remainder of the full term of such class.  If the number of Directors is changed, any increase or decrease of Directors shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of Directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional Director appointed to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class or from the removal from office, death, disability, resignation or disqualification of a Director or other cause shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class,
Section 3.
                                 
Classes of Directors

but in no case will a decrease in the number of Directors have the effect of removing or shortening the term of any incumbent Director.
.  The Board of Directors may hold meetings and keep the books of the Corporation outside of Delaware at such places as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.  Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board.  Special meetings of the Board may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary on no less than twenty-four (24) hours notice to each Director, either personally, by mail (regular or express), facsimile transmission, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission or by any combination thereof.  Special meetings shall be called by the President or Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of a majority of the Board of Directors.  Notice of the calling of any special meeting may be disseminated in any manner set forth above by the person calling the meeting or by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary provided such notice indicates the person who has duly called the special meeting.  Notice shall state the time and place of the special meeting to be so held.  Except as otherwise specifically provided in these By-laws, no notice of the objects or purposes of any special meeting of the Board of Directors need be given and, unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at any such special meeting.

Except as otherwise provided by the charter of any committee of the
Section 5.
                                 
Quorum
12
 
Board of Directors, one-third of the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of committee business.
.  If the office of any Director becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, an increase in the number of Directors or otherwise, a majority of the remaining Directors, though less than a quorum, shall choose a successor, who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect to which such vacancy occurred and until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified..
Section 6.
                                 
Vacancies
.

Section 7.
                                 
Duties and Powers
.  The Board of Directors may, by resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the Directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in such resolution or resolutions, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may have power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.  Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.  The committees shall keep regular minutes of their proceedings and report to the Board when required.

Compensation

.  The officers of the Corporation shall be chosen by the Board of Directors, who at any time, may elect a Chairman of the Board, a Chief Executive Officer, a Chief Operating Officer, a President, one or more Vice-Presidents, a Secretary, and a Treasurer.
