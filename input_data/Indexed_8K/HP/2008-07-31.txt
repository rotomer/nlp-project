For the nine months ended June 30, 2008, the Company reported net income of $335,253,000 ($3.16 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $1,452,824,000 compared with net income of $332,851,000  ($3.17 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $1,180,209,000 during the nine months ended June 30, 2007.

Helmerich & Payne, Inc. also announced today that, since its last announcement in late May, it had signed 18 long-term contracts with eight exploration and production companies to operate 18 new FlexRigs*.

Since the beginning of this fiscal year, the Company has announced 50 new contracts for the construction and operation of 50 new FlexRigs under long-term contracts with firm term durations of three years or greater.  This also brings to 127, the total number of long-term commitments for new FlexRigs that have been announced by the Company since March, 2005.  To date, 95 of the 127 new builds have been completed, with the remaining 32 scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal 2009.  Upon completion of these commitments, FlexRigs will represent over 70% of the Company's global fleet and over 80% of its U.S. land rig fleet.

Company President and C.E.O., Hans Helmerich commented
"This past quarter's results in our U.S. land rig operations and the announcement of 18 more new build orders further validate the Company's leadership in implementing new technology in the field. We believe that as FlexRigs continue to meet and exceed expectations in the field and bring meaningful value to our customers with safer and lower cost wells, demand for both the FlexRig and the organizational competence H&P delivers, will provide more opportunities for growth in both our U.S. and international operations."
 
All three of the Company's drilling segments recorded improved results compared with the previous quarter.  The Company's U.S. land rig segment operating income increased sequentially by 11% to $159,413,000 for this year's third quarter, from $143,740,000 during this year's second quarter.  Last year's third quarter U.S. land rig segment operating income was $114,619,000.  Segment operating income grew during the quarter as a result of both increased average margins per rig day and growth in total rig activity driven primarily by the Company's new build program.  Average margins for the quarter increased to $13,365 per rig day, compared to $12,858 per rig day in the previous quarter, a $507 per day increase.  Total revenue days for the recent quarter increased by 7% over the previous quarter as the Company's average rig utilization remained high, totaling 96% for this year's third quarter, compared to 94% for the previous quarter.
 
The Company's offshore operations reported segment operating income of $12,013,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, compared with $3,603,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and $4,553,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2007.   The recent commencement of operations of two additional platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and one rig offshore Trinidad helped increase third quarter average dayrates, margins and rig utilization compared to the same statistics in the second quarter.  Total activity days in the offshore operations during the quarter were 732, compared with 514 days during the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and 546 activity days during the same period last year.  By the end of this year's third quarter, eight of the Company's nine platform rigs were working.
 
Segment operating income for the Company's international land operations was $17,492,000 during this year's third quarter, compared with $12,752,000 during this year's second quarter and $28,873,000 during last year's third quarter.  This year's second quarter income included an accounting adjustment of $5.9 million relating to the depreciation of certain assets recorded in prior years.  Average rig utilization for the third

Operating statistics exclude the effects of offshore management contracts, gains and losses from translation of foreign currency transactions, and do not include reimbursements of "out-of-pocket" expenses in revenue per day, expense per day and margin calculations.
 
A management contract for a customer-owned offshore rig working in an international location was moved from the International segment to the Offshore segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The amounts for Offshore and International land segments for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2007 have been restated to reflect this change.
 
Reimbursed amounts were as follows:
 
 
With the growth of the drilling segments, the previously reported Real Estate segment has become a smaller percentage of total segment operating income. As a result, the Real Estate segment has been included with other non-reportable business segments. The three months ended March 31, 2008, and the three and nine months ended June 30, 2007, have been restated to reflect this change.

Segment operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's performance, as it excludes general and administrative expenses, corporate depreciation, income from asset sales and other corporate income and expense.  The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company's core businesses.  This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company's reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods.  The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers.  Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons.  However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company's operating performance in future periods.
 
The following table reconciles segment operating income per the information above to income before income taxes and equity in income of affiliates as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands).
