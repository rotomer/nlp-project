In connection with the spin-off, Helmerich & Payne and Cimarex entered into a Distribution Agreement pursuant to which Cimarex (i) assumed all of the assets and liabilities relating to the E&P business and (ii) indemnified Helmerich & Payne for E&P-related liabilities, including the litigation.  Since that time, and in accordance with the Distribution Agreement, Cimarex has assumed and conducted the defense of the litigation.
