Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 
On January 8, 2009, a judgment was entered by the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma in the matter captioned This judgment, totaling $126.368 million included $6.845 million of actual damages and an additional $119.523 million of profits Helmerich & Payne, Inc. ("H&P") allegedly earned on the $6.845 million.
H.B. Krug, et al v. Helmerich & Payne, Inc.
 
Although H&P is identified in the caption of this litigation, H&P does not believe that it will incur any damages with respect to such litigation since H&P is indemnified for these damages by Cimarex Energy Co. ("Cimarex").  The litigation relates to the exploration and production ("E&P") business that was separated from H&P pursuant to a spin-off transaction consummated in 2002.  In connection with the spin-off, H&P and Cimarex entered into a Distribution Agreement pursuant to which Cimarex (i) assumed all of the assets and liabilities relating to the E&P business and (ii) indemnified H&P for E&P-related liabilities, including the litigation.  Since that time, and in accordance with the Distribution Agreement, Cimarex has assumed and conducted the defense of the litigation.
