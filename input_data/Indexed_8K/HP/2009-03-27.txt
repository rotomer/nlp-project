On March 25, 2009, Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (the "Company") amended its form of Nonqualifed Stock Option Agreement entered into between the Company and certain employees, including officers, in connection with stock options granted under the Helmerich & Payne, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan").  The Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement was amended to add a provision addressing suspension and termination of stock option awards granted under the Plan.  In particular, if the Human Resources Committee of the Company's Board of Directors determines that a Plan participant has committed any illegal act, fraud, embezzlement or deliberate disregard of Company rules or policies that may reasonably be expected to result in loss, damage or injury to the Company, the Human Resources Committee may (1) cancel any outstanding stock option award granted to the Plan participant, in whole or in part, whether the award is vested or deferred and/or (2) if such conduct or activity occurs during a Company fiscal year in which there is also an exercise or receipt of an award, require the Plan participant to repay to the Company any gain realized or value received upon exercise or receipt of the award.
