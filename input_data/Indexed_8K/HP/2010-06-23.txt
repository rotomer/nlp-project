Hans Helmerich, CEO and President, commented on the upcoming retirement of Mr. Orr, "It would be hard to overstate Alan's contribution to the Company.  More than the lead role he played in the design of the FlexRig, Alan and his team drove a host of innovations that allow the Company to be widely recognized today as the industry's onshore technology leader.  His proudest accomplishment is the safety by design' concept that has achieved a step change in improving the work environment and in driving industry leading safety results.  The Company appreciates Alan's loyalty and commitment and is confident that his legacy will be advanced through Rob Stauder's leadership going forward."
 
Effective July 31, 2010, Rob Stauder will be promoted to Vice President and Chief Engineer of Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co.  Since joining the Company in 1984 as a roughneck and engineer trainee, Mr. Stauder has served in various supervisory positions, including Manager of Deepwater Engineering from 1997 until 2006 when Mr. Stauder was
