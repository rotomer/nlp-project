ITEM 8.01             OTHER EVENTS.
 
On June 30, 2010, the Official Gazette of Venezuela published the decree of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, which decree authorizes the "forceful acquisition" of 11 drilling rigs owned by the Venezuelan subsidiary of Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (the "Company").  The decree also authorizes the acquisition of other movable and real estate assets associated with operation of the subject drilling rigs.  The expropriation became effective June 30, 2010.  It is not clear to the Company what type or amount of compensation, if any, it may receive.  Nonetheless, the Company intends to pursue any and all of its options to recover a fair value for the seized assets.
 
For additional details related to the Company's operations and risks in Venezuela, please refer to the Company's June 24, 2010 press release attached as Exhibit 99 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on such date, as well as the Company's latest annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly authorized the undersigned to sign this report on its behalf.
