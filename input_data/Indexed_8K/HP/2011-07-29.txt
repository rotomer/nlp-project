Helmerich & Payne, Inc. also announced today that, in addition to the 12 new FlexRig commitments announced earlier this month, the Company has entered into agreements to build and operate 20 additional FlexRigs.

The names of the customers and other terms were not disclosed.
 
The Company has now announced commitments during this fiscal year to build a total of 58 new FlexRigs, all under multi-year term contracts with attractive dayrates and economic returns.  This represents a 28 percent increase in the number of FlexRigs in the Company
'
s fleet.  Including the new builds announced today, 42 remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately three FlexRigs per month.  In response to the significant increase in demand for FlexRigs, the Company is now planning to increase the production cadence to four FlexRigs per month beginning October 2011.
 
Consistent with the Company
'
s long standing tradition of innovative leadership, Helmerich & Payne, Inc. also announced today the introduction of the FlexRig5 design, the fifth FlexRig generation.

features of H&P's flagship FlexRig3 combined with a bi-directional pad drilling system and equipment capacities suitable for wells in excess of 24,000 feet of measured depth. The FlexRig5 will help the Company expand into new markets as it provides its customers with a broader offering.

President and CEO Hans Helmerich commented,
"
We are pleased with the Company's third quarter results and the announcement of 20 additional rig orders, bringing our quarterly total to 32 new builds.  Our introduction of the FlexRig5 reflects our ongoing commitment to innovative design and driving enhanced rig capacity and performance.  It promises to deliver all the FlexRig safety, performance and reliability features that our customers have come to rely upon in a greater depth capacity, multi-well pad drilling application."
 
Segment operating income for U.S. land operations was $176,832,000 for the third fiscal quarter of 2011, compared with $103,138,000 for last year's third fiscal quarter and $164,289,000 for this year's second fiscal quarter.  The sequential increase in segment operating income was primarily attributable to increased drilling activity related to the delivery of new build FlexRigs.  The Company's quarterly revenue days for the segment increased by approximately six percent to 18,912 revenue days during the third fiscal quarter of 2011, from 17,797 revenue days during the second fiscal quarter of 2011.  The corresponding average rig revenue per day also sequentially increased by $330 to $25,970 during the third fiscal quarter of 2011.  The $330 increase in average rig revenue per day was largely offset by a $291 increase in average rig expense per day, generating only a slight sequential increase in average rig margin per day, from $13,183 during this year's second fiscal quarter to $13,222 during this year's third fiscal quarter.  However, the lawsuit settlement mentioned in the first paragraph (that was unrelated to normal operations during the quarter) resulted in approximately $189 per day that is included in the average rig expense per day of $12,748 during the third fiscal quarter.  Rig utilization for the Company's U.S. land segment was 87% for this year's third fiscal quarter, compared with 76% for last year's third fiscal quarter and 85% for this year's second fiscal quarter.  At June 30, 2011, the Company's U.S. land segment had 213 contracted rigs and 32 idle rigs.  The 213 contracted rigs included 140 rigs under term contracts.
 
Segment operating income for the Company's offshore operations was $12,944,000 for the third fiscal quarter of 2011, compared with $11,231,000 for last year's third fiscal quarter and $11,476,000 for this year's second fiscal quarter.  The sequential increase in segment operating income was primarily a function of a higher average rig margin per day, which was $25,820 for this year's third fiscal quarter as compared to $23,747 for this year's second fiscal quarter.
 
The Company's international land operations reported a segment operating loss of $624,000 for this year's third fiscal quarter, compared with operating income of $9,893,000 for last year's third fiscal quarter and $2,443,000 for this year's second fiscal quarter.  The sequential decline in segment operating income was primarily a function of a lower average rig margin per day, which was $5,353 for this year's third fiscal quarter as compared to $7,106 for this year's second fiscal quarter.
 
Helmerich & Payne, Inc. is primarily a contract drilling company.  As of July 29, 2011, the Company's existing fleet included 249 land rigs in the U.S., 24 international land rigs and nine offshore platform rigs.  In addition, the Company is scheduled to complete by the end of fiscal 2012 another 42 new H&P-designed and operated FlexRigs under long-term contracts with customers.  Upon completion of these commitments, the Company's global land fleet is expected to have a total of 315 rigs, including 267 FlexRigs.

Segment operating income for all segments is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's performance, as it excludes general and administrative expenses, corporate depreciation, income from asset sales and other corporate income and expense.  The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company's core businesses.  This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company's reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods.  The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers.  Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons.  However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company's operating performance in future periods.
 
The following table reconciles operating income per the information above to income from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands).
