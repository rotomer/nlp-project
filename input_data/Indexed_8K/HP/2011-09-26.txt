ITEM 8.01             OTHER EVENTS.
 
On June 29, 2010, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez authorized the "forcible taking" of 11 drilling rigs and other personal and real property owned by subsidiaries of Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (the "Company").
 
The Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, C.A. ("Plaintiffs") filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 23, 2011 against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petrleos de Venezuela, S.A. and PDVSA Petrleo, S.A.  Plaintiffs seek damages for the taking of their Venezuelan drilling business in violation of international law and for breach of contract.  At this time the net impact of this matter on the Company's consolidated financial results, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly authorized the undersigned to sign this report on its behalf.
