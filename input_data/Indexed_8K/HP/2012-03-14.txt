FOURTH.  The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 161,000,000 of which 1,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock without par value, and the remaining 160,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock of the par value of ten cents (10) per share.

(1)
          
Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors, each such series to be distinctly designated.

(a)
          
The rate and times at which, and the terms and conditions on which, dividends on Preferred Stock of such series will be paid;

The right, if any, of the holders of Preferred Stock of such series to convert the same into, or exchange the same for, shares of other classes or series of stock of the Corporation and the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange;
 
(c)
          
The redemption price or prices and the time or time at which, and the terms and conditions on which, Preferred Stock of such series may be redeemed;
 
(d)
          
The rights of the holders of Preferred Stock of such series upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up, or merger, consolidation, distribution or sale of assets, of the Corporation;
 
(e)
          
The terms of the sinking fund or redemption or purchase account, if any, to be provided for the Preferred Stock of such series; and

provided, however, that the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall have no right to participate with the holders of Common Stock in any distribution of dividends in excess of the preferential dividend fixed for such Preferred Stock or in the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders in excess of the preferential amount fixed for such Preferred Stock.
 
(2)
          
Until requirements that have matured with respect to preferential dividends on the Preferred Stock (fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph (1) of this Part I) shall have been met and until the Corporation shall have complied with all such requirements, if any, with respect to the setting aside of sums as sinking funds or redemption or purchase accounts with respect to the Preferred Stock (fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph (1) of this Part I) , no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared upon or in respect of any Common Stock.
 
(3)
          
Until distribution in full of the preferential amount to be distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock (fixed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph (1) of this Part I) in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, no such distribution shall be made to the holders of Common Stock.
(4)
          
No holder of Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall have any preemptive or preferential right of subscription to any shares of any stock of the Corporation of any class, now or hereafter authorized, or to any obligations convertible into stock of the Corporation, issued or sold, nor any right of subscription to any thereof other than such, if any, as the Board of Directors of the Corporation in its discretion from time to time may determine, and at such price as the Board of Directors from time to time may fix, pursuant to the authority hereby conferred by the Certificate of Incorporation, and the Board of Directors may issue stock of the Corporation, or obligations convertible into stock, without offering such issue of stock or such obligations either in whole or in part, to the holders of Preferred Stock of the Corporation.
 
(5)
          
The powers and rights of the holders of Common Stock shall be subordinated to the powers, preferences and rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.

(6)
          
Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (5) of this Part I, the Board of Directors, acting pursuant to authority granted in this Certificate of Incorporation in respect of any series of Preferred Stock, may provide that if this Corporation shall have defaulted in the payment of dividends on any such series of Preferred Stock in an amount equivalent to or exceeding six full quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) or the Corporation shall have defaulted in making any two mandatory sinking fund payments on any such series of Preferred Stock, the holders of one or more or all of such series of Preferred Stock in respect of which any such default shall have occurred (voting as a single class) shall be entitled to elect, in the aggregate, not more than two directors.
 
(7)
          
The issuance of shares of any series of Preferred Stock by the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be provided for in the Certificate of Incorporation or by the Board of Directors, pursuant to authority granted in the Certificate of Incorporation, including provision for the consent, by class vote, of the holders of a stated percentage of the outstanding shares of any series of Preferred Stock.
 
(8)
          
Subject to the provisions of Paragraph (7) of this Part I, shares of any series of Preferred Stock may be authorized or issued, in aggregate amounts not exceeding the total number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation, from time to time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall determine and for such consideration as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors.
Subject to the prior and superior rights of the Preferred Stock, and on the conditions set forth in the foregoing Part I or in any resolution of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of any particular series of Preferred Stock, and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board of Directors may be declared and paid on the Common Stock from time to time of any funds legally available therefor.
 
The holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held at all meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation.
 
After payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Preferred Stock in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation shall be distributed among the holders of the Common Stock according to their respective shares.
 
Ownership of shares of any class of the capital stock of the Corporation shall not entitle the holders thereof to any preemptive right to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of capital stock of any class of the Corporation or any securities convertible into any class of capital stock of the Corporation, however acquired, issued or sold by the corporation, it being the purpose and intent that the Board of Directors shall have full right, power and authority to offer for subscription or sell or to make any disposal of any or all unissued shares of the capital stock of the corporation or any securities convertible into stock of any or all shares of stock or convertible securities issued and thereafter acquired by the corporation, for such consideration, not less than the par value thereof, in money or property, as the Board of Directors shall determine.
 
The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any share, right or option is registered as the owner thereof, for all purposes, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share, right or option on the part of any other person, whether or not the corporation shall have notice thereof, save as may be expressly provided by laws of the State of Delaware.
 
FIFTH.  The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.
 
SIXTH.  The private property of the stockholders shall not be subject to the payment of corporate debts to any extent whatever.
 
SEVENTH.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, and in addition to the powers which may be conferred by the By-Laws, the Board
 
of Directors of the Corporation shall have the following expressly stipulated powers and authority, to-wit:
To make, alter or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation.
 
To authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon the real and personal property of the Corporation.
 
To set apart out of any of the funds of the Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and to abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
 
By resolution or resolutions, passed by a majority of the whole board to designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in said resolution or resolutions or in the By-Laws of the Corporation, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may have power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.  Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be stated in the By-Laws of the Corporation or as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
 
When and as authorized by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding having voting power given at a stockholders meeting duly called for that purpose, or when authorized by the written consent of the holders of a majority of the voting stock issued and outstanding, to sell, lease or exchange all of the property and assets of the corporation, including its good will and its corporate franchises, upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration, which may be in whole or in part shares of stock in, and/or other securities of, any other corporation or corporations, as its Board of Directors shall deem expedient and for the best interests of the corporation.
 
Also, the corporation may in its By-Laws confer powers upon its Board of Directors in addition to the foregoing, and in addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon it by statute.
 
EIGHTH.  The corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any share is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, and shall not be bound to recognized any equitable or other claims to, or interest in, such share on the part of any other person, whether or not the corporation shall have notice thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided by the statutes of the State of Delaware.
 
NINTH.
 
(a)
          
The number of Directors which constitute the whole Board of Directors of
 
the Corporation shall be such as from time to time shall be fixed by or in the manner provided in the By-Laws, but in no case shall the number be less than three.  Vacancies in the Board of Directors, whether created by increase in the number of Directors or otherwise, shall be filled in the manner provided in the By-Laws.
(b)
          
Until the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible, which shall be designated the "first class," the "second class" and the "third class," each class to hold office until its successors are elected and qualified.  At each Annual Meeting of Stockholders prior to the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, successors to the class of Directors, whose term expires in that year, will be elected for a three-year term.  Vacancies in any class that occur prior to the expiration of the then current term of such class, if filled by the Board of Directors, shall be filled for the remainder of the full term of such class.  If the number of Directors is hereafter changed, any increase or decrease in Directors shall be apportioned among the classes so as to establish or maintain equality in number among the classes and any additional Director elected to any class shall hold office for a term which shall coincide with the term of such class.  Where the number of Directors constituting the whole board is such that it is impossible to establish or maintain complete equality in number among the classes, the increase or decrease in Directors shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain all classes as nearly equal in number as possible and so that the third class does not have more members than either the first or second class, and the second class does not have more members than the first class.
 
(c)
          
Beginning with the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, successors to the class or classes of Directors whose term expires in that year will be elected for a term expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  Beginning with the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the classification of the Board of Directors shall cease, and the Board of Directors shall be elected at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders for a term expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
 
(d)
          
Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock, if any, to elect additional Directors under specified circumstances, (i) prior to the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors may remove any Director, but only for cause and (ii) from and after the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors may remove any Director, with or without cause.
 
TENTH.

2.
            
Indemnification and Insurance
.
 
(a)
          
Right to Indemnification
.  Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer, of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators:   PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except as provided in paragraph (b) hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition:   PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise.  The Corporation may,
 
by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.
(b)
          
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
.  If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Section is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the said amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard or conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
(c)
          
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
.  The right to indemnification and the payment of expense incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
 
(d)
          
Insurance
.  The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
 
FIFTEENTH.  The affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the total outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required in order for the Corporation to:
 
(a)
          
Merge, and/or consolidate with any other corporation except in those cases where at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of stock of such other
 
corporation is owned by this Corporation; or
(b)
          
Sell, lease, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or business.
 
The affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the total outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required in order for the Corporation to:
 
(a)
          
Sell, lease, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or business to a related corporation or an affiliate of a related corporation; or
 
(b)
          
Merge with a related corporation or an affiliate of a related corporation; or
 
(c)
          
Enter into a combination or majority share acquisition in which this Corporation is the acquiring corporation and its voting shares are issued or transferred to a related corporation or an affiliate of a related corporation or to stockholders of a related corporation or an affiliate of a related corporation.
 
For the purpose of this Article FIFTEENTH, (i) a "related corporation" in respect of a given transaction shall be any corporation which, together with its affiliates and associated persons, owns of record or beneficially, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the shares of any outstanding class of stock of this Corporation entitled to vote upon such transaction, as of the record date used to determine the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote upon such transaction; (ii) an "affiliate" of a related corporation shall be any individual, joint venturer, trust, partnership or corporation which directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with the related corporation; (iii) an "associated person" of a related corporation shall be any officer or director or any beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of any class of equity security, of such related corporation or any of its affiliates.  The determination of the Board of Directors of this Corporation and made in good faith shall be conclusive as to whether any corporation is a related corporation as defined in this Article FIFTEENTH.

that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.  If it is determined that such electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information on which they relied.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; , , that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

.  The number of Directors which shall constitute the entire Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three nor more than 15 Directors, the exact number of which shall from time to time be fixed by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.  If the number of Directors is increased, as provided above or otherwise pursuant to law, such increase shall be deemed to create vacancies to be filled as provided in Section 6.  A decrease in the number of Directors shall not affect the term of office of any Director then in office.  Beginning with the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an annual meeting of stockholders and each Director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such Director's successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until such Director's earlier death, resignation or removal.  For avoidance of doubt, each Director whose term of office for which he or she was elected has not expired as of the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders shall continue to hold office until such time as his or her term has expired, or until such Director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

appointment.  No Officer of the Corporation, other than a person who is or has been Chairman of the Board or President, shall become nor may remain a member of the Board of Directors after ceasing to be an officer.  Directors need not be stockholders.  The Board of Directors may by a resolution passed by a two-thirds vote of the entire Board of Directors waive the qualifications set forth in this Section 2 with respect to any director if the Board of Directors determines that such action is in the best interests of the Corporation.
Section 3.
                                 
Classes of Directors:  Declassification
.
 
(a)
                                 
Until the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, which shall be known as the First Class, the Second Class and the Third Class.  Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third the total number of Directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.  Until the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, and except as otherwise provided for filling vacancies, the Directors of the Corporation shall be elected by class at the annual meeting of stockholders to serve for a three-year term and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.  Vacancies in any class that occur prior to the expiration of the then current term of such class if filled by the Board of Directors shall be filled for the remainder of the full term of such class.  If the number of Directors is changed, any increase or decrease of Directors shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of Directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional Director appointed to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class or from the removal from office, death, disability, resignation or disqualification of a Director or other cause shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of Directors have the effect of removing or shortening the term of any incumbent Director.
(b)

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
THIS NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (the "Option Agreement"), is made as of the grant date set forth on the cover page of this Option Agreement (the "Cover Page") at Tulsa, Oklahoma by and between the participant named on the Cover Page (the "Participant") and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (the "Company").
 
WHEREAS, the Participant is an employee of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company, or an Affiliated Entity, and it is important to the Company that the Participant be encouraged to remain in the employ of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or Affiliated Entity; and
 
WHEREAS, in recognition of such facts, the Company desires to provide to the Participant an opportunity to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Company, as hereinafter provided, pursuant to the "Helmerich & Payne, Inc. 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan" (the "Plan"), a copy of which has been provided to the Participant; and
 
WHEREAS, any capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meanings given them in the Plan.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and for good and valuable consideration, the Participant and the Company hereby agree as follows:
 
Section 1.             
Grant of Stock Option
.  The Company hereby grants to the Participant a nonqualified stock option (the "Stock Option") to purchase all or any part of the number of shares of its Common Stock, par value $.10 (the "Stock") set forth on the Cover Page, under and subject to the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement and the Plan which is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof for all purposes.  The purchase price for each share to be purchased hereunder shall be the option price set forth on the Cover Page (the "Option Price") which shall equal the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by this Stock Option on the Date of Grant.
 
Section 2.             
Times of Exercise of Option
.  The Participant shall be eligible to exercise the Stock Option pursuant to the vesting schedule set forth on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Schedule"), subject to the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement having been satisfied.  Upon satisfaction of the vesting conditions, the Participant may exercise on or after the applicable vesting date specified on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Dates"), on a cumulative basis, the number of Stock Options determined by multiplying the aggregate number of shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option set forth on the Cover Page by the designated percentage set forth on the Cover Page.
 
Section 3.             
Term of Stock Option
.  Subject to earlier termination as hereafter provided, the Stock Option shall expire at the close of business on the expiration date set forth on the Cover Page and may not be exercised after such expiration date; provided, however, in no event shall the term of the Stock Option be longer than ten years from the Date of Grant.  Unless vesting is accelerated or extended pursuant to the terms of Section 6, unvested Stock Options shall be forfeited upon the Participant's termination of employment.
 
Section 4.             
Transferability of Stock Option
.
 
(a)           .  Except as provided in Section 4(b) hereof, the Stock Option shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the Stock Option may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. More particularly (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), the Stock Option may not be assigned, transferred (except as provided above and in Section 4(b) hereof), pledged or hypothecated in any way, shall not be assignable by operation of law and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process.  Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Stock Option contrary to the provisions hereof shall be null and void and without effect.
General
 
(b)           .  The Stock Options may be transferred by such Participant to (i) the ex-spouse of the Participant pursuant to the terms of a domestic relations order, (ii) the spouse, children or grandchildren of the Participant ("Immediate Family Members"), (iii) a trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit of such Immediate Family Members, or (iv) a partnership in which such Immediate Family Members are the only partners; provided that there may be no consideration for any such transfer and subsequent transfers of transferred  Stock Options shall be prohibited except those in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof.  Following transfer, any such Stock Options shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer, provided that for purposes of this Section 4(b) the term "Participant" shall be deemed to refer to the transferee.  The events of termination of employment in the Plan shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Participant, following which the Stock Options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the periods specified in the Plan.  No transfer pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Company shall have been furnished with written notice of such transfer together with such other documents regarding the transfer as the Committee shall request.
Limited Transferability of Stock Options
 
Section 5.             
Employment
.  So long as the Participant shall continue to be a full-time and continuous employee of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company, an Affiliated Entity or a corporation or a parent or a Subsidiary of such corporation issuing or assuming a Stock Option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, the Stock Option shall not be affected by any change of duties or position.  Nothing in the Plan or in this Option Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or an Affiliated Entity, or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or an Affiliated Entity to terminate the Participant's employment at any time.
Section 6.             
Vesting of Stock Options on Death, Retirement, Disability or Other Special Circumstances
.  In the event of the Participant's death after the date Participant becomes Retirement Eligible, any and all unvested Stock Options under this Option Agreement shall become automatically fully vested.  In the event the Participant voluntarily terminates employment or terminates employment due to Disability following the date he becomes Retirement Eligible, subject to the provisions of Section 9, the Participant shall be eligible to continue to vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule provided that (i) the Participant is continuously employed as a full-time employee through the one-year anniversary of the Date of Grant, (ii) the Participant complies with the requirements set forth in Section 8 below at all times during the remainder of the Vesting Schedule and (iii) the Participant executes and delivers to the Company a compliance certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A indicating the Participant's full compliance with Section 8 on or before November 1 of each year during the remainder of the Vesting Schedule.  For purposes of this Option Agreement, "Retirement Eligible" shall mean the date the Participant both (i) attains age 55 and (ii) has 15 or more continuous years of service as a full-time employee of the Company or a Subsidiary.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the vesting of Stock Options for which the applicable Vesting Date(s) has not yet occurred upon the Participant's date of termination of employment if such termination occurs by reason of (i) Disability, (ii) death, or (iii) upon the occurrence of special circumstances (as determined by the Committee).
 
Section 7.             
Period of Exercise Upon Termination of Employment
.  With respect to shares subject to the Stock Option for which the applicable Vesting Dates have occurred or for which the Committee has accelerated or extended vesting in accordance with Section 6, the Participant, or the representative of a deceased Participant, shall be entitled to purchase such shares during the remaining term of the Stock Option if (i) the Participant's employment was terminated as a result of death, Disability, or Retirement or (ii) the Participant voluntarily terminated employment after becoming Retirement Eligible.  If the Participant's employment was terminated for any other reason, the Participant shall be entitled to purchase such vested Stock Options for a period of three months from such date of termination and any Stock Options which remain unvested after such date shall be cancelled.
 
Section 8.             
Non-Disclosure and Confidential Information
.
 
(a)           .  For purposes of this Option Agreement, "confidential information" includes, without limitation, information with respect to the Company's or its subsidiaries' finances, oil and gas drilling processes, costs and pricing, customer contracts, contracts and requirements, vendor or supplier contracts, contracts for other information, compensation structures, recruitment and training policies, operation support and backup facilities, service and product formulas, concepts, data, know-how improvements and strategies, computer programs and listings (whether in source code and/or object code format), software design and methodology, research and development or investigations, marketing strategies, ideas and plans for ongoing or future businesses, new business or other developments, new and innovative service or product ideas, inventions, potential acquisitions or divestitures, business and litigation strategies and future business and litigation plans and any other information or material that is of special or unique value to the Company or its subsidiaries maintained as confidential and not disclosed to the general public (whether through an annual report and/or filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise).
Confidential Information
 
(b)           .  Participant agrees that due to Participant's knowledge of the confidential information, Participant would inevitably use and/or disclose that information, in breach of Participant's confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations under this Option Agreement, if Participant worked in certain capacities or engaged in certain activities for a period of time following the termination of Participant's employment relationship with the Company or a subsidiary, specifically in the position which involved either (i) responsibility and decision-making authority or input at the executive level regarding any subject, (ii) responsibility or decision-making authority or input at any management level in the participant's individual area of assignment with the Company or a subsidiary or (iii) responsibility or decision-making authority or input that allows for the use of confidential information for the benefit of any person (including Participant) or entity in the oil and gas drilling or other business that develops, provides or markets any products or services that are otherwise competitive with or similar to the products or services of the Company or its subsidiaries (the "Restricted Occupations").  Therefore, in the event the Participant is eligible for continued vesting pursuant to Section 6, except with the prior written consent of an authorized officer of the Company, during the period of continued vesting following Participant's employment with the Company or its subsidiaries, Participant agrees not to be employed by, consult for or otherwise act on behalf of any person or entity (without regard to geographic location) in any capacity in which the Participant would be involved directly or indirectly in a Restricted Occupation.  In the event the Committee determines in its sole judgment that the Participant has engaged in activities in contravention of this Section 8, Participant's eligibility for continued vesting under Section 6 shall cease and any unvested Options shall be forfeited.  Participant acknowledges this commitment is intended to protect the confidential information and is not intended to be applied or interpreted as a covenant against competition.
Non-Disclosure
 
Section 9.             
Suspension or Termination of Awards
.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Option Agreement to the contrary, if at any time (including after notice of exercise has been delivered) the Committee reasonably believes that the Participant has committed an act of misconduct as described in this paragraph, the Committee may suspend the Participant's right to exercise or receive any Award pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed.  If the Committee determines the Participant has committed an illegal act, fraud, embezzlement or deliberate disregard of Company rules or policies (including any violation of the Participant's non-disclosure, non-compete or similar agreement) that may reasonably be expected to result in loss, damage or injury to the Company, the Committee may (a) cancel any outstanding Award granted to the Participant, in whole or in part, whether or not vested or deferred and/or (b) if such conduct or activity occurs during a Company fiscal year in which there was also an exercise or receipt of an Award, require the Participant to repay to the Company any gain realized or value received upon the exercise or receipt of such Award (with such gain or value received valued as of the date of exercise or receipt).  Cancellation and repayment obligations will be effective as of the date specified by the Committee.  Any repayment obligation may be satisfied in stock or cash or a combination thereof (based upon the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the day of payment), and the Committee may provide for an offset to any future payments owed by the Company or any affiliate to the Participant if necessary to satisfy the repayment obligation.  The determination regarding cancellation of an Award or a repayment obligation shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee and shall be binding upon the Participant and the Company.
Section 10.           
Method of Exercising Stock Option
.
 
(a)           .  The manner of exercising the Stock Option herein granted shall be by written notice to the Secretary of the Company at the time the Stock Option, or part thereof, is to be exercised, and in any event prior to the expiration of the Stock Option.  Such notice shall state the election to exercise the Stock Option, the number of shares of Stock to be purchased upon exercise, the form of payment to be used, and shall be signed by the person so exercising the Stock Option.
Procedures for Exercise
 
(b)           .  Payment in full for shares of Stock purchased under this Option Agreement shall accompany the Participant's notice of exercise, together with payment for any applicable withholding taxes.  Payment shall be made (i) in cash or by check, draft or money order payable to the order of the Company; (ii) by delivering Stock or other equity securities of the Company having a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the amount of the Option Price; (iii) by a Net-Exercise; or (iv) a combination thereof.  In addition to the foregoing procedure which may be available for the exercise of the Stock Option, the Participant may deliver to the Company a notice of exercise which includes an irrevocable instruction to the Company to deliver the Stock certificate representing the shares of Stock being purchased, issued in the name of the Participant, to a broker approved by the Company and authorized to trade in the Common Stock of the Company.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall acknowledge receipt of the executed notice of exercise and forward this notice to the broker.  Upon receipt of the copy of the notice which has been acknowledged by the Company, and without waiting for issuance of the actual Stock certificate with respect to the exercise of the Stock Option, the broker may sell the Stock or any portion thereof. The broker shall deliver directly to the Company that portion of the sales proceeds sufficient to cover the Option Price and withholding taxes, if any.  For all purposes of effecting the exercise of the Stock Option, the date on which the Participant gives the notice of exercise to the Company, together with payment for the shares of Stock being purchased and any applicable withholding taxes, shall be the "date of exercise."  If a notice of exercise and payment are delivered at different times, the date of exercise shall be the date the Company first has in its possession both the notice and full payment as provided herein.
Form of Payment
 
(c)           .  In the event the Stock Option is exercised, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 10, by any person due to the death of the Participant, such notice shall also be accompanied by appropriate proof of the right of such person to exercise the Stock Option.  The notice so required shall be given by personal delivery to the Secretary of the Company or by registered or certified mail, addressed to the Company at 1437 South Boulder Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74119, and it shall be deemed to have been given when it is so personally delivered or when it is deposited in the United States mail in an envelope addressed to the Company, as aforesaid, properly stamped for delivery as a registered or certified letter.
Further Information
 
Section 11.           
Change of Control
.  Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, any and all Stock Options under this Option Agreement shall become automatically fully vested and immediately exercisable with such acceleration to occur without the requirement of any further act by either the Company or the Participant.
 
Section 12.           
Securities Law Restrictions
.  The Stock Option shall be exercised and Stock issued only upon compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and any other applicable securities law, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. If deemed necessary by the Company to comply with the Act or any applicable laws or regulations relating to the sale of securities, the Participant, at the time of exercise and as a condition imposed by the Company, shall represent, warrant and agree that the shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option are being purchased for investment and not with any present intention to resell the same and without a view to distribution, and the Participant shall, upon the request of the Company, execute and deliver to the Company an agreement to such effect.  The Participant acknowledges that any Stock certificate representing Stock purchased under such circumstances will be issued with a restricted securities legend.
 
Section 13.           
Payment of Withholding Taxes
.  No exercise of any Stock Option may be effected until the Company receives full payment for any required state and federal withholding taxes.  Payment for withholding taxes shall be made in cash, by check, by the Participant surrendering, or the Company retaining from the shares of Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Stock Option, that number of shares of Stock (based on Fair Market Value) that would be necessary to satisfy the requirements for withholding any amounts of taxes due upon the exercise of the Stock Option, or by a combination of the foregoing.  For the purpose of calculating the Fair Market Value of shares surrendered or retained to pay withholding taxes, the relevant date shall be the date of exercise.  In the event the Participant uses the "cashless" exercise/same-day sale procedure set forth in Section 10(b) hereof to pay withholding taxes, the actual sale price of shares sold to satisfy payment shall be used to determine the amount of withholding taxes payable.  Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as requiring payment of withholding taxes at the time of exercise if payment of taxes is deferred pursuant to any provision of the Code, and actions satisfactory to the Company are taken which are designed to reasonably insure payment of withholding taxes when due.
 
Section 14.           
Notices
.  All notices or other communications relating to the Plan and this Option Agreement as it relates to the Participant shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or mailed (U.S. Mail) by the Company to the Participant at the then current address as maintained by the Company or such other address as the Participant may advise the Company in writing.
 
Section 15.           
Conflicts
.  In the event of any conflicts between this Agreement and the Plan, the latter shall control.  In the event any provision hereof conflicts with applicable law, that provision shall be severed, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable.
 
Section 16.           
No Part of Other Plans
.  The benefits provided under this Agreement or the Plan shall not be deemed to be a part of or considered in the calculation of any other benefit provided by the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity to the Participant.
 
Section 17.           
Participant and Award Subject to Plan
.  As specific consideration to the Company for the Award, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Agreement.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement as of the day and year first above written.
I hereby certify that I am in full compliance with the covenants contained in that certain Option Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of                               , 20     between Helmerich & Payne, Inc. and me and have been in full compliance with such covenants at all times during the twelve-month period immediately preceding November 1 of the year designated below.
 
 
Shares Subject to Restricted Stock Award:
Expiration Date:
 
THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (the "Award Agreement"), is made as of the grant date set forth on the cover page of this Award Agreement (the "Cover Page") at Tulsa, Oklahoma by and between the participant named on the Cover Page (the "Participant") and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (the "Company").
WHEREAS, the Participant is an employee of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company, or an Affiliated Entity, and it is important to the Company that the Participant be encouraged to remain in the employ of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company, or an Affiliated Entity; and
 
WHEREAS, in recognition of such facts, the Company desires to provide to the Participant an opportunity to receive shares of the Common Stock of the Company, as hereinafter provided, pursuant to the "Helmerich & Payne, Inc. 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan" (the "Plan"), a copy of which has been provided to the Participant; and
 
WHEREAS, any capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meanings given them in the Plan.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and for good and valuable consideration, the Participant and the Company hereby agree as follows:
 
Section 1.             
Grant of Restricted Stock Award
.  The Company hereby grants to the Participant an award (the "Restricted Stock Award") of                            (        ) shares of its Common Stock, par value $.10 (the "Stock") set forth on the Cover Page, under and subject to the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement and the Plan which is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof for all purposes.
 
Section 2.             
Stock Held by Company
.  The Restricted Stock Award shall be evidenced via a book entry registration or the issuance of a stock certificate or certificates as determined by the Company.  As a condition precedent to the book entry registration or the issuing of a certificate representing these shares of the Award, the Participant must deliver to the Company a duly executed irrevocable stock power (in blank) covering such shares represented by the certificate in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto.  All shares of the Award held by the Company pursuant to this Award Agreement shall constitute issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company for all corporate purposes, and the Participant shall be entitled to vote such shares and shall receive all cash dividends thereon provided that the right to vote or receive such dividends shall terminate with respect to shares which have been forfeited as provided under this Award Agreement.  While such shares are held by the Company and until such shares have vested on the applicable date set forth on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Date"), the Participant for whose benefit such shares are held shall not have the right to encumber or otherwise change, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of such unvested shares of
 
Stock or any interest therein, and such unvested shares of Stock shall not be subject to attachment or any other legal or equitable process brought by or on behalf of any creditor of such Participant; and any such attempt to attach or receive shares in violation of this Award Agreement shall be null and void.  If such shares shall vest on the applicable Vesting Date in accordance with this Award Agreement, the Company shall deliver the shares via book entry registration or in the form of a certificate representing such vested shares.
 
Section 3.             
Timing of Restricted Stock Award
.  The Participant shall be eligible to receive the Award pursuant to the vesting schedule set forth on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Schedule"), subject to the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement having been satisfied.  Upon satisfaction of the vesting conditions, the Participant may receive on or after the applicable vesting date specified on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Date"), the number of shares of Stock determined by multiplying the aggregate number of shares of Stock subject to the Award set forth on the Cover Page by the designated percentage set forth on the Cover Page.
 
Section 4.             
Term of Restricted Stock Award
.  Subject to earlier termination as herein provided, the Restricted Stock Award shall expire at the close of business on the expiration date set forth on the Cover Page and may not become vested after such expiration date.  Unless vesting is accelerated or extended pursuant to the terms of Section 7, unvested shares of Stock subject to the Award shall be forfeited upon Participant's termination of employment.
 
Section 5.             
Nontransferability of Restricted Stock Award
.  Except as otherwise herein provided, the Restricted Stock Award shall not be transferable by the Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  More particularly (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), unvested shares of Stock held by the Company may not be assigned, transferred (except as provided above), pledged or hypothecated in any way, shall not be assignable by operation of law and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process.  Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Restricted Stock Award contrary to the provisions hereof shall be null and void and without effect.  All shares of Stock which are distributed to the Participant as provided under this Award Agreement may not be subsequently transferred except as provided herein.
 
Section 6.             
Employment
.  Nothing in the Plan or in this Award Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company, its parent or any Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity or interfere in any way with the right of the Company, its parent or any Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity to terminate the Participant's employment at any time.
 
Section 7.             
Vesting of Restricted Stock Awards
.  In the event of the Participant's death after the date Participant becomes Retirement Eligible, any and all unvested shares of Stock under this Award Agreement shall become automatically fully vested.  In the event the Participant voluntarily terminates employment or terminates employment due to Disability following the date he becomes Retirement Eligible, subject to the provisions of Section 9, the Participant shall be eligible to continue to vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule provided that (i) the Participant is continuously employed as a full-time employee through the one-year anniversary of the Date of Grant, (ii) the Participant complies with the requirements set forth in Section 8 below at all times during the remainder of the Vesting Schedule and (iii) the
 
Participant executes and delivers to the Company a compliance certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B indicating the Participant's full compliance with Section 8 on or before November 1 of each year during the remainder of the Vesting Schedule.  For purposes of this Award Agreement, "Retirement Eligible" shall mean the date the Participant both (i) attains age 55 and (ii) has 15 or more continuous years of service as a full-time employee of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may elect to accelerate the vesting for all or any part of the shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award for which the applicable Vesting Date(s) has not yet occurred on the date of the Participant's termination of employment if such termination occurs by reason of death, termination of employment due to a Disability, or Retirement.
 
Section 8.             
Non-Disclosure and Confidential Information
.
 
(a)           .  For purposes of this Award Agreement, "confidential information" includes, without limitation, information with respect to the Company's or its subsidiaries' finances, oil and gas drilling processes, costs and pricing, customer contracts, contracts and requirements, vendor or supplier contracts, contracts for other information, compensation structures, recruitment and training policies, operation support and backup facilities, service and product formulas, concepts, data, know-how improvements and strategies, computer programs and listings (whether in source code and/or object code format), software design and methodology, research and development or investigations, marketing strategies, ideas and plans for ongoing or future businesses, new business or other developments, new and innovative service or product ideas, inventions, potential acquisitions or divestitures, business and litigation strategies and future business and litigation plans and any other information or material that is of special or unique value to the Company or its subsidiaries maintained as confidential and not disclosed to the general public (whether through an annual report and/or filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise).
Confidential Information
 
(b)           .  Participant agrees that due to Participant's knowledge of the confidential information, Participant would inevitably use and/or disclose that information, in breach of Participant's confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations under this Award Agreement, if Participant worked in certain capacities or engaged in certain activities for a period of time following the termination of Participant's employment relationship with the Company or a subsidiary, specifically in the position which involved either (i) responsibility and decision-making authority or input at the executive level regarding any subject, (ii) responsibility or decision-making authority or input at any management level in the participant's individual area of assignment with the Company or a subsidiary or (iii) responsibility or decision-making authority or input that allows for the use of confidential information for the benefit of any person (including Participant) or entity in the oil and gas drilling or other business that develops, provides or markets any products or services that are otherwise competitive with or similar to the products or services of the Company or its subsidiaries (the "Restricted Occupations").  Therefore, in the event the Participant is eligible for continued vesting pursuant to Section 7, except with the prior written consent of an authorized officer of the Company, during the period of continued vesting following Participant's employment with the Company or its subsidiaries, Participant agrees not to be employed by, consult for or otherwise act on behalf of any person or entity (without regard to geographic location) in any capacity in which the Participant would be involved directly or indirectly in a Restricted Occupation.  In the event the Committee
Non-Disclosure
 
determines in its sole judgment that the Participant has engaged in activities in contravention of this Section 8, Participant's eligibility for continued vesting under Section 7 shall cease and any unvested shares of Stock shall be forfeited.  Participant acknowledges this commitment is intended to protect the confidential information and is not intended to be applied or interpreted as a covenant against competition.
 
Section 9.             
Suspension or Termination of Awards
.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, if at any time (including after notice of exercise has been delivered) the Committee reasonably believes that the Participant has committed an act of misconduct as described in this paragraph, the Committee may suspend the Participant's right to exercise or receive any Award pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed.  If the Committee determines the Participant has committed an illegal act, fraud, embezzlement or deliberate disregard of Company rules or policies (including any violation of the Participant's non-disclosure, non-compete or similar agreement) that may reasonably be expected to result in loss, damage or injury to the Company, the Committee may (a) cancel any outstanding Award granted to the Participant, in whole or in part, whether or not vested or deferred and/or (b) if such conduct or activity occurs during a Company fiscal year in which there was also an exercise or receipt of an Award, require the Participant to repay to the Company any gain realized or value received upon the exercise or receipt of such Award (with such gain or value received valued as of the date of exercise or receipt).  Cancellation and repayment obligations will be effective as of the date specified by the Committee.  Any repayment obligation may be satisfied in stock or cash or a combination thereof (based upon the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the day of payment), and the Committee may provide for an offset to any future payments owed by the Company or any affiliate to the Participant if necessary to satisfy the repayment obligation.  The determination regarding cancellation of an Award or a repayment obligation shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee and shall be binding upon the Participant and the Company.
 
Section 10.           
Change of Control
.  Any and all shares under this Restricted Stock Award shall become automatically fully vested upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event with such acceleration to occur without the requirement of any further act by either the Company or the Participant.
 
Section 11.           
Securities Law Restrictions
.  The Restricted Stock Award shall be vested and Stock issued only upon compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and any other applicable securities law, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. If deemed necessary by the Company to comply with the Act or any applicable laws or regulations relating to the sale of securities, the Participant, at the time of exercise and as a condition imposed by the Company, shall represent, warrant and agree that the shares of Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Award are being acquired for investment and not with any present intention to resell the same and without a view to distribution, and the Participant shall, upon the request of the Company, execute and deliver to the Company an agreement to such effect.  The Participant acknowledges that any stock certificate representing Stock acquired under such circumstances will be issued with a restricted securities legend.
 
Section 12.           
Withholding of Taxes
.  The Company may make such provision as it may deem appropriate for the withholding of any applicable federal, state, or local taxes that it
 
determines it may be obligated to withhold or pay in connection with the vesting of the Restricted Stock.  A Participant must pay the amount of taxes required by law upon the vesting of a Restricted Stock Award (i) in cash or by check, (ii) by the Participant surrendering, or the Company retaining from the shares of Stock to be issued to the Participant, that number of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the amount of such required withholding, or (iii) by a combination of the foregoing.
 
Section 13.           
Legends
.  The shares of Stock which are the subject of the Award shall be subject to the following legend:

Section 15.           
Conflicts
.  In the event of any conflicts between this Agreement and the Plan, the latter shall control.  In the event any provision hereof conflicts with applicable law, that provision shall be severed, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable.
 
Section 16.

Section 1.             
Grant of Stock Option
.

Section 2.             
Times of Exercise of Option
.  The Participant shall be eligible to exercise the Stock Option pursuant to the vesting schedule set forth on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Schedule"), subject to the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement having been satisfied.

Unless vesting is accelerated or extended pursuant to the terms of Section 6, unvested Stock Options shall be forfeited upon the Participant's termination of employment.
 
Section 4.             
Transferability of Stock Option

Except as provided in Section 4(b) hereof, the Stock Option shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the Stock Option may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. More particularly (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), the Stock Option may not be assigned, transferred (except as provided above and in Section 4(b) hereof), pledged or hypothecated in any way, shall not be assignable by operation of law and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process.  Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Stock Option contrary to the provisions hereof shall be null and void and without effect.

Section 6.             
Vesting of Stock Options on Death, Retirement, Disability or Other Special Circumstances
.  In the event of the Participant's death after the date Participant becomes Retirement Eligible, any and all unvested Stock Options under this Option Agreement shall become automatically fully vested.

Nonsolicitation
.  In the event the Participant is eligible for continued vesting pursuant to Section 6, such continued vesting shall be subject to and contingent upon Participant's agreement not to solicit the Company's customers or employees under the terms of this Section 8.  During the period of continued vesting, Participant shall not solicit the established customers of the Company wherever located (or if this geographic area shall be unenforceable by law, then in such geographic area as shall be enforceable) for the sale of any product or service competitive with any product or service offered for sale by the Company at the time of the termination of Participant's employment.  For purposes of this Option Agreement, "solicit" shall mean to contact an established customer directly, whether by announcement, e-mail, note, letter or other direct mail, telephone call, personal visit, business meeting, or any other method, which contact either is designed to or has the effect of inducing, promoting or advancing a prohibited sale by Participant or on Participant's behalf to that customer.  An "established customer" means any entity that Participant knows or should know who is purchasing or has a written or unwritten agreement to purchase one or more products and/or services from the Company at the time of termination of Participant's employment or any entity with whom the Company had, at the time of the termination of Participant's employment,
exchanged confidential information in anticipation of negotiating for the sale of products and/or services in the foreseeable future.  "Offered for sale" includes products/services which Participant knows or should know have been ordered or have otherwise been prepared by the Company for imminent offering.  Further, during the continued vesting period, Participant shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or employ any of the Company's current or former employees on behalf of any other employer.  In the event the Committee determines in its sole judgment that Participant has solicited customers or employees of the Company in contravention of this Section 8, any unvested Options shall be forfeited.
 
Section 9.             
Suspension or Termination of Awards
.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Option Agreement to the contrary, if at any time (including after notice of exercise has been delivered) the Committee reasonably believes that the Participant has committed an act of misconduct as described in this paragraph, the Committee may suspend the Participant's right to exercise or receive any Award pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed.  If the Committee determines the Participant has committed an illegal act, fraud, embezzlement or deliberate disregard of Company rules or policies (including any violation of the Participant's non-disclosure, non-compete or similar agreement) that may reasonably be expected to result in loss, damage or injury to the Company, the Committee may (a) cancel any outstanding Award granted to the Participant, in whole or in part, whether or not vested or deferred and/or (b) if such conduct or activity occurs during a Company fiscal year in which there was also an exercise or receipt of an Award, require the Participant to repay to the Company any gain realized or value received upon the exercise or receipt of such Award (with such gain or value received valued as of the date of exercise or receipt).  Cancellation and repayment obligations will be effective as of the date specified by the Committee.  Any repayment obligation may be satisfied in stock or cash or a combination thereof (based upon the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the day of payment), and the Committee may provide for an offset to any future payments owed by the Company or any affiliate to the Participant if necessary to satisfy the repayment obligation.  The determination regarding cancellation of an Award or a repayment obligation shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee and shall be binding upon the Participant and the Company.
 
Section 10.           
Method of Exercising Stock Option
.
 
(a)           .  The manner of exercising the Stock Option herein granted shall be by written notice to the Secretary of the Company at the time the Stock Option, or part thereof, is to be exercised, and in any event prior to the expiration of the Stock Option.  Such notice shall state the election to exercise the Stock Option, the number of shares of Stock to be purchased upon exercise, the form of payment to be used, and shall be signed by the person so exercising the Stock Option.
Procedures for Exercise
 
(b)           .  Payment in full for shares of Stock purchased under this Option Agreement shall accompany the Participant's notice of exercise, together with payment for any applicable withholding taxes.  Payment shall be made (i) in cash or by check, draft or money order payable to the order of the Company; (ii) by delivering Stock or other equity securities of the Company having a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the amount of the Option Price; (iii) by a Net-Exercise; or (iv) a combination thereof.  In addition to the foregoing procedure which may be available for the exercise of the Stock Option, the
Form of Payment
Participant may deliver to the Company a notice of exercise which includes an irrevocable instruction to the Company to deliver the Stock certificate representing the shares of Stock being purchased, issued in the name of the Participant, to a broker approved by the Company and authorized to trade in the Common Stock of the Company.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall acknowledge receipt of the executed notice of exercise and forward this notice to the broker.  Upon receipt of the copy of the notice which has been acknowledged by the Company, and without waiting for issuance of the actual Stock certificate with respect to the exercise of the Stock Option, the broker may sell the Stock or any portion thereof. The broker shall deliver directly to the Company that portion of the sales proceeds sufficient to cover the Option Price and withholding taxes, if any.  For all purposes of effecting the exercise of the Stock Option, the date on which the Participant gives the notice of exercise to the Company, together with payment for the shares of Stock being purchased and any applicable withholding taxes, shall be the "date of exercise."  If a notice of exercise and payment are delivered at different times, the date of exercise shall be the date the Company first has in its possession both the notice and full payment as provided herein.
 
(c)           .  In the event the Stock Option is exercised, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 10, by any person due to the death of the Participant, such notice shall also be accompanied by appropriate proof of the right of such person to exercise the Stock Option.  The notice so required shall be given by personal delivery to the Secretary of the Company or by registered or certified mail, addressed to the Company at 1437 South Boulder Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74119, and it shall be deemed to have been given when it is so personally delivered or when it is deposited in the United States mail in an envelope addressed to the Company, as aforesaid, properly stamped for delivery as a registered or certified letter.
Further Information
 
Section 11.           
Change of Control
.  Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, any and all Stock Options under this Option Agreement shall become automatically fully vested and immediately exercisable with such acceleration to occur without the requirement of any further act by either the Company or the Participant.
 
Section 12.           
Securities Law Restrictions
.  The Stock Option shall be exercised and Stock issued only upon compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and any other applicable securities law, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. If deemed necessary by the Company to comply with the Act or any applicable laws or regulations relating to the sale of securities, the Participant, at the time of exercise and as a condition imposed by the Company, shall represent, warrant and agree that the shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option are being purchased for investment and not with any present intention to resell the same and without a view to distribution, and the Participant shall, upon the request of the Company, execute and deliver to the Company an agreement to such effect.  The Participant acknowledges that any Stock certificate representing Stock purchased under such circumstances will be issued with a restricted securities legend.
Section 13.           
Payment of Withholding Taxes
.  No exercise of any Stock Option may be effected until the Company receives full payment for any required state and federal withholding taxes.  Payment for withholding taxes shall be made in cash, by check, by the Participant surrendering, or the Company retaining from the shares of Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Stock Option, that number of shares of Stock (based on Fair Market Value) that would be necessary to satisfy the requirements for withholding any amounts of taxes due upon the exercise of the Stock Option, or by a combination of the foregoing.  For the purpose of calculating the Fair Market Value of shares surrendered or retained to pay withholding taxes, the relevant date shall be the date of exercise.  In the event the Participant uses the "cashless" exercise/same-day sale procedure set forth in Section 10(b) hereof to pay withholding taxes, the actual sale price of shares sold to satisfy payment shall be used to determine the amount of withholding taxes payable.  Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as requiring payment of withholding taxes at the time of exercise if payment of taxes is deferred pursuant to any provision of the Code, and actions satisfactory to the Company are taken which are designed to reasonably insure payment of withholding taxes when due.
 
Section 14.           
Notices
.  All notices or other communications relating to the Plan and this Option Agreement as it relates to the Participant shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or mailed (U.S. Mail) by the Company to the Participant at the then current address as maintained by the Company or such other address as the Participant may advise the Company in writing.
 
Section 15.           
Conflicts
.  In the event of any conflicts between this Agreement and the Plan, the latter shall control.  In the event any provision hereof conflicts with applicable law, that provision shall be severed, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable.
 
Section 16.           
No Part of Other Plans
.  The benefits provided under this Agreement or the Plan shall not be deemed to be a part of or considered in the calculation of any other benefit provided by the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity to the Participant.
 
Section 17.           
Participant and Award Subject to Plan
.  As specific consideration to the Company for the Award, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Agreement.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement as of the day and year first above written.
I hereby certify that I am in full compliance with the covenants contained in that certain Option Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of                               , 20     between Helmerich & Payne, Inc. and me and have been in full compliance with such covenants at all times during the twelve-month period immediately preceding November 1 of the year designated below.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (the "Award Agreement"), is made as of the grant date set forth on the cover page of this Award Agreement (the "Cover Page") at Tulsa, Oklahoma by and between the participant named on the Cover Page (the "Participant") and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (the "Company").
 
WHEREAS, the Participant is an employee of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company, or an Affiliated Entity, and it is important to the Company that the Participant be encouraged to remain in the employ of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company, or an Affiliated Entity; and
 
WHEREAS, in recognition of such facts, the Company desires to provide to the Participant an opportunity to receive shares of the Common Stock of the Company, as hereinafter provided, pursuant to the "Helmerich & Payne, Inc. 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan" (the "Plan"), a copy of which has been provided to the Participant; and
 
WHEREAS, any capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meanings given them in the Plan.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and for good and valuable consideration, the Participant and the Company hereby agree as follows:
 
Section 1.             
Grant of Restricted Stock Award
.  The Company hereby grants to the Participant an award (the "Restricted Stock Award") of                            (        ) shares of its Common Stock, par value $.10 (the "Stock") set forth on the Cover Page, under and subject to the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement and the Plan which is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof for all purposes.
 
Section 2.             
Stock Held by Company
.  The Restricted Stock Award shall be evidenced via a book entry registration or the issuance of a stock certificate or certificates as determined by the Company.  As a condition precedent to the book entry registration or the issuing of a certificate representing these shares of the Award, the Participant must deliver to the Company a duly executed irrevocable stock power (in blank) covering such shares represented by the certificate in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto.  All shares of the Award held by the Company pursuant to this Award Agreement shall constitute issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company for all corporate purposes, and the Participant shall be entitled to vote such shares and shall receive all cash dividends thereon provided that the right to vote or receive such dividends shall terminate with respect to shares which have been forfeited as provided under this Award Agreement.  While such shares are held by the Company and until such shares have vested on the applicable date set forth on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Date"), the Participant for whose benefit such shares are held shall not have the right to encumber or otherwise change, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of such unvested shares of
 
 
Stock or any interest therein, and such unvested shares of Stock shall not be subject to attachment or any other legal or equitable process brought by or on behalf of any creditor of such Participant; and any such attempt to attach or receive shares in violation of this Award Agreement shall be null and void.  If such shares shall vest on the applicable Vesting Date in accordance with this Award Agreement, the Company shall deliver the shares via book entry registration or in the form of a certificate representing such vested shares.
 
Section 3.             
Timing of Restricted Stock Award
.  The Participant shall be eligible to receive the Award pursuant to the vesting schedule set forth on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Schedule"), subject to the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement having been satisfied.  Upon satisfaction of the vesting conditions, the Participant may receive on or after the applicable vesting date specified on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Date"), the number of shares of Stock determined by multiplying the aggregate number of shares of Stock subject to the Award set forth on the Cover Page by the designated percentage set forth on the Cover Page.
 
Section 4.             
Term of Restricted Stock Award
.  Subject to earlier termination as herein provided, the Restricted Stock Award shall expire at the close of business on the expiration date set forth on the Cover Page and may not become vested after such expiration date.  Unless vesting is accelerated or extended pursuant to the terms of Section 7, unvested shares of Stock subject to the Award shall be forfeited upon Participant's termination of employment.
 
Section 5.             
Nontransferability of Restricted Stock Award
.  Except as otherwise herein provided, the Restricted Stock Award shall not be transferable by the Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  More particularly (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), unvested shares of Stock held by the Company may not be assigned, transferred (except as provided above), pledged or hypothecated in any way, shall not be assignable by operation of law and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process.  Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Restricted Stock Award contrary to the provisions hereof shall be null and void and without effect.  All shares of Stock which are distributed to the Participant as provided under this Award Agreement may not be subsequently transferred except as provided herein.
 
Section 6.             
Employment
.  Nothing in the Plan or in this Award Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company, its parent or any Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity or interfere in any way with the right of the Company, its parent or any Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity to terminate the Participant's employment at any time.
 
Section 7.             
Vesting of Restricted Stock Awards
.  In the event of the Participant's death after the date Participant becomes Retirement Eligible, any and all unvested shares of Stock under this Award Agreement shall become automatically fully vested.  In the event the Participant voluntarily terminates employment or terminates employment due to Disability following the date he becomes Retirement Eligible, subject to the provisions of Section 9, the Participant shall be eligible to continue to vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule provided that (i) the Participant is continuously employed as a full-time employee through the one-year anniversary of the Date of Grant, (ii) the Participant complies with the requirements set forth in Section 8 below at all times during the remainder of the Vesting Schedule and (iii) the
 
 
Participant executes and delivers to the Company a compliance certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B indicating the Participant's full compliance with Section 8 on or before November 1 of each year during the remainder of the Vesting Schedule.  For purposes of this Award Agreement, "Retirement Eligible" shall mean the date the Participant both (i) attains age 55 and (ii) has 15 or more continuous years of service as a full-time employee of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may elect to accelerate the vesting for all or any part of the shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award for which the applicable Vesting Date(s) has not yet occurred on the date of the Participant's termination of employment if such termination occurs by reason of death, termination of employment due to a Disability, or Retirement.
 
Section 8.             
Nonsolicitation
.  In the event the Participant is eligible for continued vesting pursuant to Section 7, such continued vesting shall be subject to and contingent upon Participant's agreement not to solicit the Company's customers or employees under the terms of this Section 8.  During the period of continued vesting, Participant shall not solicit the established customers of the Company wherever located (or if this geographic area shall be unenforceable by law, then in such geographic area as shall be enforceable) for the sale of any product or service competitive with any product or service offered for sale by the Company at the time of the termination of Participant's employment.  For purposes of this Award Agreement, "solicit" shall mean to contact an established customer directly, whether by announcement, e-mail, note, letter or other direct mail, telephone call, personal visit, business meeting, or any other method, which contact either is designed to or has the effect of inducing, promoting or advancing a prohibited sale by Participant or on Participant's behalf to that customer.  An "established customer" means any entity that Participant knows or should know who is purchasing or has a written or unwritten agreement to purchase one or more products and/or services from the Company at the time of termination of Participant's employment or any entity with whom the Company had, at the time of the termination of Participant's employment, exchanged confidential information in anticipation of negotiating for the sale of products and/or services in the foreseeable future.  "Offered for sale" includes products/services which Participant knows or should know have been ordered or have otherwise been prepared by the Company for imminent offering.  Further, during the continued vesting period, Participant shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or employ any of the Company's current or former employees on behalf of any other employer.  In the event the Committee determines in its sole judgment that Participant has solicited customers or employees of the Company in contravention of this Section 8, any unvested shares of Stock shall be forfeited.
 
Section 9.             
Suspension or Termination of Awards
.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, if at any time (including after notice of exercise has been delivered) the Committee reasonably believes that the Participant has committed an act of misconduct as described in this paragraph, the Committee may suspend the Participant's right to exercise or receive any Award pending a determination of whether an act of misconduct has been committed.  If the Committee determines the Participant has committed an illegal act, fraud, embezzlement or deliberate disregard of Company rules or policies (including any violation of the Participant's non-disclosure, non-compete or similar agreement) that may reasonably be expected to result in loss, damage or injury to the Company, the Committee may (a) cancel any outstanding Award granted to the Participant, in whole or in part, whether or not vested or deferred and/or (b) if such conduct or activity occurs during a Company fiscal year in
 
 
which there was also an exercise or receipt of an Award, require the Participant to repay to the Company any gain realized or value received upon the exercise or receipt of such Award (with such gain or value received valued as of the date of exercise or receipt).  Cancellation and repayment obligations will be effective as of the date specified by the Committee.  Any repayment obligation may be satisfied in stock or cash or a combination thereof (based upon the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the day of payment), and the Committee may provide for an offset to any future payments owed by the Company or any affiliate to the Participant if necessary to satisfy the repayment obligation.  The determination regarding cancellation of an Award or a repayment obligation shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee and shall be binding upon the Participant and the Company.
 
Section 10.           
Change of Control
.  Any and all shares under this Restricted Stock Award shall become automatically fully vested upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event with such acceleration to occur without the requirement of any further act by either the Company or the Participant.
 
Section 11.           
Securities Law Restrictions
.  The Restricted Stock Award shall be vested and Stock issued only upon compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and any other applicable securities law, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. If deemed necessary by the Company to comply with the Act or any applicable laws or regulations relating to the sale of securities, the Participant, at the time of exercise and as a condition imposed by the Company, shall represent, warrant and agree that the shares of Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Award are being acquired for investment and not with any present intention to resell the same and without a view to distribution, and the Participant shall, upon the request of the Company, execute and deliver to the Company an agreement to such effect.  The Participant acknowledges that any stock certificate representing Stock acquired under such circumstances will be issued with a restricted securities legend.
 
Section 12.           
Withholding of Taxes
.  The Company may make such provision as it may deem appropriate for the withholding of any applicable federal, state, or local taxes that it determines it may be obligated to withhold or pay in connection with the vesting of the Restricted Stock.  A Participant must pay the amount of taxes required by law upon the vesting of a Restricted Stock Award (i) in cash or by check, (ii) by the Participant surrendering, or the Company retaining from the shares of Stock to be issued to the Participant, that number of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the amount of such required withholding, or (iii) by a combination of the foregoing.
 
Section 13.           
Legends
.  The shares of Stock which are the subject of the Award shall be subject to the following legend:

THIS DIRECTOR NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (the "Option Agreement"), is made as of the grant date set forth on the cover page of this Award Agreement (the "Cover Page") at Tulsa, Oklahoma by and between the participant named on the Cover Page (the "Participant") and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (the "Company"):
 
WHEREAS, Participant is a Director of the Company, and it is important to the Company that Participant be encouraged to remain in the service of the Company; and
 
WHEREAS, in recognition of such facts, the Company desires to provide to Participant an opportunity to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Company, as hereinafter provided, pursuant to the "Helmerich & Payne, Inc. 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan" (the "Plan"), a copy of which has been provided to Participant; and
 
WHEREAS, any capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meanings given them in the Plan.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and for good and valuable consideration, Participant and the Company hereby agree as follows:
 
Section 1.     
Grant of Stock Option
.  The Company hereby grants to the Participant a nonqualified stock option (the "Stock Option") to purchase all or any part of the number of shares of its Common Stock, par value $.10 (the "Stock") set forth on the Cover Page, under and subject to the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement and the Plan which is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof for all purposes.  The purchase price for each share to be purchased hereunder shall be the option price set forth on the Cover Page (the "Option Price") which shall equal the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by this Stock Option on the Date of Grant.
 
Section 2.     
Vesting.
  Subject to the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement, Participant's Stock Option shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable on the Date of Grant.
 
Section 3.     
Term of Stock Option
.  Subject to earlier termination as provided in this Option Agreement or in the Plan, the Stock Option shall expire at the close of business ten years from the Date of Grant and may not be exercised after such expiration date.
 
Section 4.     
Transferability of Stock Option.
 
(a)  General.
  Except as provided in Section 4(b) hereof, the Stock Option shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the Stock Option may be exercised, during the lifetime of Participant, only by Participant. More
 
particularly (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), the Stock Option may not be assigned, transferred (except as provided above and in Section 4(b) hereof), pledged or hypothecated in any way, shall not be assignable by operation of law and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, or similar process.  Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of the Stock Option contrary to the provisions hereof shall be null and void and without effect.

Section 7.     
Securities Law Restrictions

.  The Restricted Stock Award shall be evidenced via a book entry registration or the issuance of a stock certificate or certificates as determined by the Company.

While such shares are held by the Company and until such shares have vested on the applicable date set forth on the Cover Page (the "Vesting Date"), the Participant for whose benefit such shares are held shall not have the right to encumber or otherwise change, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of such unvested shares of Stock or any interest therein, and such unvested shares of Stock shall not be subject to attachment or any other legal or equitable process brought by or on behalf of any creditor of such
