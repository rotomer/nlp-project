Exhibit 99
HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. / 1437 SOUTH BOULDER AVENUE / TULSA, OKLAHOMA
 
April 26, 2012
 
Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE: HP) reported income from continuing operations of $129,763,000 ($1.18 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $769,982,000 for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2012, compared to income from continuing operations of $98,961,000 ($0.91 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $604,406,000 during last year's second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2011.  Included in this year's and last year's second fiscal quarter income from continuing operations were $0.05 and $0.02 per share, respectively, of after-tax gains related to the sale of used drilling equipment.  Net income for the second fiscal quarter of 2012 was $129,719,000 ($1.18 per diluted share), compared to net income of $98,790,000 ($0.91 per diluted share) during last year's second fiscal quarter.
 
For the six months ended March 31, 2012, the Company reported income from continuing operations of $274,060,000 ($2.51 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $1,502,570,000 compared with income from continuing operations of $203,326,000 ($1.87 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $1,199,048,000 during the six months ended March 31, 2011.  Included in income from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal 2012 and 2011 were approximately $0.07 and $0.04 per share, respectively, of gains from the sale of used drilling equipment.  Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2012 was $274,005,000 ($2.51 per diluted share), compared to net income of $202,940,000 ($1.87 per diluted share) during the first six months of fiscal 2011.
 
Segment operating income for U.S. land operations was $209,959,000 for the second fiscal quarter of 2012, compared with $164,289,000 for last year's second fiscal quarter and $224,706,000 for this year's first fiscal quarter.  The sequential decline in segment operating income was mainly attributable to an increase in operating expenses, even though the segment's rig activity level and average rig revenue per day continued to improve during the second fiscal quarter of 2012.  Quarterly revenue days for the segment sequentially increased by approximately two percent to 21,444 revenue days during the second fiscal quarter of 2012.  The corresponding average rig revenue per day also sequentially increased by $764 to $27,625 during the second fiscal quarter of 2012.  Nonetheless, the increase in average rig revenue per day was more than offset by a $1,534 increase in average rig expense per day, generating a sequential decline of $770 in average rig margin per day, from $14,569 during this year's first fiscal quarter to $13,799 during this year's second fiscal quarter.  Rig utilization for the Company's U.S. land segment was 91% for this year's second fiscal quarter, compared with 85% for last year's second fiscal quarter and 91% for this year's first fiscal quarter.  At March 31,

2012, the Company's U.S. land segment had 241 contracted rigs (including 159 under term contracts) and 25 idle rigs.
Chairman and CEO Hans Helmerich commented,
"The U.S. land market transition towards oil and liquids-rich-gas directed drilling continues, along with a clear trend towards more complex well designs and higher performance rig requirements.  Our FlexRigs*, combined with our premium service offering, are well positioned to make the transition.  We are fortunate to have a customer roster with substantial multi-year drilling inventory that is capable of shifting targets and taking advantage of strong oil prices.  These customers are also continuing to strive for added drilling efficiencies and allowed us to add nine previously announced new builds to our order book during the quarter.  As we enter the second half of fiscal 2012, we continue to deliver four new rigs per month on time and on budget."
 
Segment operating income for the Company's offshore operations was $9,818,000 for the second fiscal quarter of 2012, compared with $11,476,000 for last year's second fiscal quarter and $12,204,000 for this year's first fiscal quarter.  The sequential decline in segment operating income was primarily a function of a reduced level of activity and a lower average rig margin per day.  The number of revenue days for this year's second fiscal quarter sequentially declined by approximately ten percent, and the average rig margin per day for this year's second fiscal quarter was $20,561 as compared to $22,171 for this year's first fiscal quarter.
 
The Company's international land operations segment reported a loss of $974,000 for this year's second fiscal quarter, compared with operating income of $2,443,000 for last year's second fiscal quarter and operating income of $7,939,000 for this year's first fiscal quarter.  The sequential decline in segment operating income was mostly attributable to increased operating expenses during this year's second fiscal quarter.  As a result, average rig margin per day decreased to $4,884 in the second fiscal quarter of 2012 from $9,015 in the first fiscal quarter of 2012.  Also as compared to this year's first fiscal quarter, the number of revenue days for the second fiscal quarter increased by approximately two percent to 1,761.
 
Helmerich & Payne, Inc. is primarily a contract drilling company.  As of April 26, 2012, the Company's existing fleet included 270 land rigs in the U.S., 26 international land rigs and nine offshore platform rigs.  In addition, the Company is scheduled to complete another 34 new H&P-designed and operated FlexRigs under long-term contracts with customers.  Upon completion of these commitments, the Company's global fleet is expected to have a total of 330 land rigs, including 293 FlexRigs.

Segment operating income for all segments is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's performance, as it excludes general and administrative expenses, corporate depreciation, income from asset sales and other corporate income and expense.  The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company's core businesses.  This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company's reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods.  The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers.  Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons.  However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company's operating performance in future periods.
 
The following table reconciles operating income per the information above to income from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands).
