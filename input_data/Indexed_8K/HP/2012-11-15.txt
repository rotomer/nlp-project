News Release

Segment operating income for U.S. land operations was $236,619,000 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, compared with $192,133,000 for last year's fourth fiscal quarter and $235,684,000 for this year's third fiscal quarter.  As compared to this year's third fiscal quarter, the number of revenue days for the segment sequentially decreased by less than one percent to 21,951, and the average rig revenue per day increased by $229 to $28,325 during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012.  Also as compared to this year's third fiscal quarter, the average rig expense per day for the segment declined by $717, and the average rig margin per day increased by $946 to $15,705 during this year's fourth fiscal quarter.  The rig revenue and margin per day averages included approximately $283 per day of early termination fees during the fourth fiscal quarter as compared to approximately $140 per day during the previous quarter.  The favorable impact of lower sequential average rig expense per day during the quarter in this segment was offset by abandonment charges of approximately $14 million that were mostly associated with obsolete equipment previously used to support drilling rig operations.  Abandonments are included with depreciation in the consolidated statements of income.  Rig utilization for the Company's U.S. land segment was 85% for this year's fourth fiscal quarter, compared with 87% for last year's fourth fiscal quarter and 89% for this year's third fiscal quarter.  At September 30, 2012, the Company's U.S. land segment had 231 contracted rigs (including 158 under term contracts) and 51 idle rigs.  Excluded from these 51 idle rigs are 4 highly mobile rigs and 2 conventional rigs that were decommissioned at the end of the fiscal year.
 
Segment operating income for the Company's offshore operations was $12,033,000 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, compared with $11,871,000 for last year's fourth fiscal quarter and $7,720,000 for this year's third fiscal quarter.  The sequential increase in segment operating income was attributable to higher levels of activity and a higher average rig margin per day.  The number of revenue days for this year's fourth fiscal quarter sequentially increased by approximately 15 percent to 695, and the average rig margin per day for this year's fourth fiscal quarter was $23,330, as compared to $16,901 for this year's third fiscal quarter.
 
The Company's international land segment operating income was $7,126,000 for this year's fourth fiscal quarter, compared with $3,525,000 for last year's fourth fiscal quarter and $6,275,000 for this year's third fiscal quarter.  The sequential increase in segment operating income was attributable to increased activity and daily margins during this year's fourth fiscal quarter.  The average rig margin per day increased to $8,210 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 from $7,704 in the third fiscal quarter of 2012.  Also as compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2012, the number of revenue days for the fourth fiscal quarter increased by approximately eight percent to 2,001.
 
Helmerich & Payne, Inc. is primarily a contract drilling company.  As of November 15, 2012, the Company's existing fleet included 289 land rigs in the U.S., 29 international land rigs and 9 offshore platform rigs.

Segment operating income for all segments is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's performance, as it excludes general and administrative expenses, corporate depreciation, income from asset sales and other corporate income and expense.  The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company's core businesses.  This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company's reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods.  The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers.  Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons.  However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company's operating performance in future periods.
 
The following table reconciles operating income per the information above to income from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands).
