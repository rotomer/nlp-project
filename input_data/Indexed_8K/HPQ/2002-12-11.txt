Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date of authentication of this Note is after a Regular Record Date specified above and before the next following Interest Payment Date, this Note shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date, unless the Company shall default in the payment of interest due on such Interest Payment Date, in which case this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid on the Notes, or unless no interest has been paid on the Notes, in which case this Note shall bear interest from the Original Issue Date.

Morgan Trust Company, National Association, a national banking association existing under the laws of the United States of America, as trustee (hereinafter called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights and duties thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates, may be subject to redemption provisions, repurchase provisions, covenants and Events of Default and on other provisions, and may otherwise vary as provided in the Indenture.
        Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof. Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
        This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by the Trustee under the Indenture.
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
        Interest payments for this Note will include interest accrued from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from and including the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or provided for) to but excluding the Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for this Note shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Interest Rate Reset
        If the Company has the option with respect to this Note to reset the Interest Rate, such option will be indicated on the face hereof, together with (i) the date or dates on which such Interest Rate may be reset (each an "Optional Reset Date") and (ii) the basis or formula, if any, for such resetting. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the Company may exercise such option by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to an Optional Reset Date. Not later than 40 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to such Optional Reset Date, the Trustee will mail to the Holder hereof a notice (the "Reset Notice"), first class, postage prepaid, setting forth (i) the election of the Company to reset the Interest Rate, (ii) such new interest rate, and (iii) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional Reset Date or, if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated Maturity of this Note (each such period a "Subsequent Interest Period"), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during such Subsequent Interest Period.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to an Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate provided for in the Reset Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Subsequent Interest Period commencing on such Optional Reset Date by mailing or causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher interest rate first class, postage prepaid, to the Holder hereof. Such notice shall be irrevocable. If the Interest Rate is reset on an Optional Reset Date this Note will bear such higher interest rate.

Specific information pertaining to Dual Currency Notes shall be included

        If the Company has the option to extend the Stated Maturity of this Note for one or more periods (each an "Extension Period") up to but not beyond the date (the "Final Maturity Date") set forth on the face hereof, such option will be indicated on the face hereof together with the basis or formula, if any, for setting the interest rate applicable to any such Extension Period. The Company may exercise such option with respect to this Note by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to the Stated Maturity in effect prior to the exercise of such option (the "Original Stated Maturity"). No later than 40 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to the Original Stated Maturity, the Trustee will mail to the Holder hereof a notice (the "Extension Notice") relating to such Extension Period, first class, postage prepaid, setting forth (i) the election of the Company to extend the Stated Maturity hereof, (ii) the new Stated Maturity, (iii) the interest rate applicable to the Extension Period, and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the Extension Period, including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Extension Period.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to the Original Stated Maturity for this Note, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by mailing or causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher interest rate first class, postage prepaid, to the Holder hereof. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Notes with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher interest rate for the Extension Period.
        If the Company elects to extend the Stated Maturity of this Note, the Holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment of this Note by the Company at the Original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus any accrued interest to such date. In order for this Note to be so repaid on the Original Stated Maturity, the Holder hereof must follow the procedures set forth below for optional repurchase, except that the period for delivery of this Note or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to the Original Stated Maturity and except that a Holder who has tendered this Note for repurchase pursuant to an Extension Notice may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke any such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth day prior to the Original Stated Maturity.

Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the Company may elect to redeem less than the entire principal amount hereof.
Repurchase at the Option of the Holder
        Unless one or more Repurchase Dates at the option of the Holder is specified on the face hereof, this Note shall not be repayable at the option of the Holder on any date prior to the Maturity Date specified on the face hereof. If one or more Repurchase Dates is so specified, this Note is subject to repurchase on any such date at the option of the Holder at the applicable Repurchase Price specified on the face hereof (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of this Note), together in the case of any such repayment with accrued interest to the Repurchase Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is prior to the Repurchase Date will be payable to the Holder of this Note, or one or more Predecessor Notes, of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates referred to on the face hereof.

The Holder of a Note may exercise the repurchase option for less than the entire principal amount of the Note provided that the principal amount of the Note remaining outstanding after repurchase is an Authorized Denomination. No transfer or exchange of any Note will be permitted after exercise of a repurchase
option. If a Note is to be repurchased in part, no transfer or exchange of the portion of the Note to be repurchased will be permitted after exercise of a repurchase option. All questions as to the validity, eligibility, including time of receipt, and acceptance of any note for repurchase will be determined by the Company and its determination will be final, binding and non-appealable.

(4)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment on such Note;
(5)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any Paying Agent from a payment on such Note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other Paying Agent;
(6)
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a failure to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation, identification or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of such Note if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the United States or by any applicable tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

General Information Regarding the Notes
Other Definitions
        "Business Day" means (a) with respect to any Note, any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that, in The City of New York, is not a day on which banking institutions generally are authorized or obligated by law to close, (b) if the Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other than United States dollars or euros, not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law to close in the financial center of the country issuing the Specified Currency, and (c) if the Note is denominated in euros, any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open. As used in the preceding sentence, "financial center" means the capital city of the country issuing the Specified Currency, except that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, South African rand and Swiss francs, the "financial center" shall be The City of New York, Sydney, Toronto, Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.
Calculation of Exchange Rates
        If this is a Foreign Currency Note to be paid in United States dollars, the United States dollar amount to be received in respect hereof will be based upon the exchange rate as determined by the Exchange Rate Agent based on the most favorable firm bid quotation for United States dollars received by such Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers in The City of New York selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) for the purchase by the quoting dealer, for settlement on such payment date, of the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable on such payment date in respect of this Note. If three quoting dealers are not available then two dealers will be used. If no such bid quotations are available, payments will be made in the Specified Currency, unless such Specified Currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or to other circumstances beyond the Company's control, in which case the Company will be entitled to make payments in respect hereof in United States dollars as provided in the manner set forth below. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder hereof by deductions from such payments. The determination of the exchange rate pursuant to the provisions of this Section is referred to herein as the "Market Exchange Rate."
Payments in Specified Currencies
        If a Holder is to receive payments in a Specified Currency other than United States dollars as described on the face hereof, payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest will be paid in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account maintained by the Holder with a bank designated by the Holder (which in the case of Global Securities will be the Depositary or its nominee) on or prior to the Regular Record Date or at least 15 days prior to Maturity, as the case may be, in the case of Certificated Securities or, in the case of Global Securities, in the manner specified on the face hereof in the third paragraph thereof following the summary of terms, provided that such bank has the appropriate facilities for such a payment in the Specified Currency,
provided
,
however
, that with respect to payments of principal and premium, if any, and interest at Maturity this Note is presented to the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such payment in accordance with its normal procedures, which shall require presentation no later than two Business Days prior to Maturity in order to ensure the availability of immediately available funds in the Specified Currency at Maturity.
        If payment on this Note is required to be made in a Specified Currency other than United States dollars and such currency is unavailable in the good faith judgment of the Company due to the
imposition of exchange controls or to other circumstances beyond the Company's control, or is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments with respect to this Note shall be made in United States dollars until such currency is again available or so used. The amount so payable on any date in such Specified Currency shall be converted into United States dollars at a rate determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate on the second Business Day prior to such payment, or, if the Market Exchange Rate is not then available, the most recently available Market Exchange Rate or as otherwise determined in good faith by the Company if the foregoing is impracticable.
        If this is a Foreign Currency Note, in the event of an official redenomination of such foreign currency (including, without limitation, an official redenomination of a foreign currency that is a composite currency) the obligations of the Company with respect to payments on this Note denominated in such currency shall, in all cases, be deemed immediately following such redenomination to provide for the payment of that amount of redenominated currency representing the amount of such obligations immediately before such redenomination. No adjustment will be made to any amount payable under this Note as a result of (a) any change in the value of a foreign currency relative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates or (b) any redenomination of any component currency of any composite currency (unless such composite currency is itself officially redenominated).
Acceleration upon an Event of Default
        If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the Principal Amount of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, if any Original Issue Discount Note (as defined below) is redeemed or repurchased by the Company or repurchased at the option of the Holder, each as described above, or if the principal of any Original Issue Discount Note is declared to be due and payable immediately pursuant to this paragraph, the amount of principal due and payable with respect to this Note shall be limited to the sum of the aggregate principal amount of this Note multiplied by the Issue Price (expressed as a percentage of the aggregate principal amount) plus the original issue discount accrued from the date of issue to the date of redemption, repayment or declaration, as applicable, which accrual shall be calculated using the "interest method" (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) in effect on the date of redemption, repurchase or declaration.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date of authentication of this Note is after a Regular Record Date specified above and before the next following Interest Payment Date, this Note shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date, unless the Company shall default in the payment of interest due on such Interest Payment Date, in which case this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid on the Notes, or unless no interest has been paid on the Notes, in which case this Note shall bear interest from the Original Issue Date.

        All payments of principal (and premium, if any) and interest in a Specified Currency other than United States dollars will be made in the manner set forth on the reverse hereof.
        This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of unsecured debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (hereinafter called the "Securities"), of the series designated above (herein called the "Notes"), all issued or to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2000, for senior debt securities (hereinafter called the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Company to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, a national banking association existing under the laws of the United States of America, as trustee (hereinafter called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights and duties thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates, may be subject to redemption provisions, repurchase provisions, covenants and Events of Default and on other provisions, and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided.
        The interest payable hereon on each Interest Payment Date will include accrued interest from the Original Issue Date or from the last date in respect of which interest has been paid on the Notes (subject to the applicable provisions set forth above), as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be. The interest rate in effect on the Notes from the Original Issue Date, to, but excluding, the first Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate. Thereafter, the Notes will bear interest at a rate reset for each period ending on and excluding an Interest Reset Date and commencing on and including the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date (or, if none, the Original Issue Date) (each an "Interest Reset Period") determined by the Calculation Agent. The interest rate per annum on this Note for each Interest Reset Period shall be the Base Rate designated above (determined as set forth on the reverse hereof), in each case adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified above and by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above. Accrued interest is calculated by multiplying the face amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day for which accrued interest is being calculated. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on that day by (i) the actual number of days in the year, in the case of the Treasury Rate Notes and CMT Rate Notes, or (ii) 360 days, in the case of all other Notes.
        The interest rate on a Note in effect on any day will be (i) if the day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date relating to that Interest Reset Date; or (ii) if the day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date relating to the preceding Interest Reset Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, shown above. In addition, the interest rate hereon shall in no event be higher than the
maximum rate permitted by New York State law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
        Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof. Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
        This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by the Trustee under the Indenture.
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
Interest Rate Reset
        The rate of interest on this Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually or as otherwise specified on the face hereof (each an "Interest Reset Date"), as specified on the face hereof. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the Interest Reset Date will be, if this Note resets daily, each Business Day; if this Note resets weekly (unless the Base Rate on this Note is the Treasury Rate), Wednesday of each week; if this Note resets weekly and the Base Rate on this Note is the Treasury Rate, Tuesday of each week; if this Note resets monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; if this Note resets quarterly, as specified on the face hereof; if this Note resets semi-annually, the third Wednesday of each of two months of each year, as specified on the face hereof; and if this Note resets annually, the third Wednesday of one month of each year, as specified on the face hereof;
provided
,
however
, that the interest rate in effect from the date of issue to the first Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof.
        If an Interest Reset Date for any Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, that Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next Business Day. However, in the case of a Note whose interest will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the heading "Determination of LIBOR" below, if that Business Day is in the following calendar month, that Interest Reset Date will be the preceding Business Day. If a Treasury bill auction, as set forth and described in the definition of "Interest Determination Date" in this Note, will be held on any day that would otherwise be an Interest Reset Date for a Note whose interest will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the heading "Determination of Treasury Rate" below, then that Interest Reset Date will instead be the Business Day immediately following that auction date.

Determination of CD Rate.
        Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, if the Base Rate is the CD Rate, CD Rate means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, the rate on that date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, as published in H.15(519), on the Calculation Date pertaining to that Interest Determination Date under the heading "CDs (secondary market)."

(i)
if by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date such rate is not published in H.15(519), then the CD Rate will be the rate on that Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit of the Index Maturity designated on the face hereof as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading "CDs (secondary market);"
(ii)
if such rate is not published in H.15 (519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date in the manner described in clause (i) above, then the Calculation Agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the following secondary market offered rates for negotiable certificates of deposit of major United States money-center banks of the highest credit standing with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity designated on the face hereof, and in a denomination of
$5,000,000: the rates offered as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date, by three leading non-bank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in The City of New York. The calculation agent, after consultation with us, will select the three dealers referred to above; and
(iii)
if fewer than three dealers are quoting as mentioned in clause (ii) above, the CD Rate will be the CD Rate in effect during the prior interest period.
Determination of Commercial Paper Rate.

(i)
if such rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on that Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity designated on the face hereof, as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading "Commercial paperNonfinancial;"
(ii)
if such rate is not published in H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date as described in clause (i) above, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the following offered rates for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized rating agency: the rates offered as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, by three leading dealers of commercial paper in The City of New York, and the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, will select the three dealers referred to in this clause (ii); and
(iii)
if fewer than three dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clause (ii) above, the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Commercial Paper Rate in effect during the prior interest period.

The following procedures will be followed if the Federal Funds Rate cannot be determined as described in the immediately preceding sentence:

(ii)
if that rate is not published in either H.15 (519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight Federal funds arranged prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date, by each of three leading brokers of Federal funds transactions in The City of New York and the Calculation Agent, after consultation with the Company, will select the three brokers referred to in this clause (ii); and

If neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Telerate is specified as the Designated LIBOR Page, LIBOR Telerate will be used. If the Designated LIBOR Page by its terms provides only for a single rate, that single rate will be used regardless of the foregoing provisions requiring more than one rate. In the case where (a) above applies, if no rate appears, or in the case where (b) above applies, if fewer than two offered rates appear, LIBOR in respect of the Interest Determination Date will be determined as if the parties had specified the rate in (ii) below;
        (ii)  with respect to an Interest Determination Date on which this provision applies, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates offered, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Interest Determination Date, by four major banks in the London interbank market to prime

The Calculation Agent will select the four banks after consultation with the Company and request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR in respect of that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.

(i)
if such rate is not published on Telerate Page 56 or Telerate Page 57 by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the auction average rate, as otherwise announced by the United States Department of the Treasury, for the Interest Determination Date;

        Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, if the Base Rate is Prime Rate, Prime Rate means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, the prime rate or base lending rate on that date, as published in H.15(519), on the Calculation Date pertaining to the Interest Determination Date under the heading "Bank prime loan." The following procedures will be followed if the Prime Rate cannot be determined as described in the immediately preceding sentence:
(i)
if such rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on the Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite the heading "Bank prime loan;"
(ii)
if such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date as described in clause (i) above, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 as that bank's prime rate or base lending rate as in effect for that Interest Determination Date;
(iii)
if fewer than four rates appear on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 on the Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted, on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year, as of the close of business on the Interest Determination Date by four major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent from a list approved by the Company;
(iv)
if fewer than two rates appear on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 on the Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates furnished by the appropriate number of substitute U.S. banks or trust companies in The City of New York that have a total equity capital of U.S. $500,000,000 or more and are subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority, as selected by the Calculation Agent from a list approved by the Company; and
(v)
if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as described in clauses (iii) and (iv) above, the Prime Rate will be the Prime Rate in effect during the prior interest period.
        "Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page" means the display on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service on the page designated as "USPRIME1," or any other page that replaces that page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks.
Determination of CMT Rate.
        Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, if the Base Rate is the CMT Rate, CMT Rate means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, the rate displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to the Interest Determination Date under the heading (or any successor heading) "Treasury Constant MaturitiesFederal Reserve Board Release H.15Mondays Approximately 3:45 p.m.," under the column for the Index Maturity as specified on the face hereof (1) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7051, such Interest Determination Date or (2) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7052, the week, or the month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week in which the related Interest
Determination Date occurs. The following procedures will be used if the CMT Rate cannot be determined as described in the immediately preceding sentence:
(i)
if such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or if not displayed by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate will be the Treasury constant maturity rate for the Index Maturity for the Interest Determination Date, as published in H.15(519);
(ii)
if such rate is no longer published in H.15(519), or if not displayed by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate will be the Treasury constant maturity rate, or other United States Treasury rate, for the Index Maturity for the Interest Determination Date as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page and published in H.15(519);
(iii)
if that information described in clause (ii) above is no longer provided by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Calculation Agent will determine the CMT Rate to be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the following secondary market offered rates for the most recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States ("Treasury Notes") with an original maturity of approximately the Index Maturity and a remaining term to maturity of not less than the Index Maturity minus one year: the rates reported as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date, by three leading primary United States government securities dealers in New York City, according to their written records. The Calculation Agent will select, after consultation with us, five leading primary United States government securities dealers and will eliminate the highest and lowest quotations or, in the event of equality, one of the highest and one of the lowest quotations;
(iv)
if the Calculation Agent cannot obtain three Treasury Note quotations as described in clause (iii) above, the Calculation Agent will determine the CMT Rate to be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the following secondary market offered rates for the most recently issued Treasury Notes with an original maturity of the number of years that is the next highest to the Index Maturity, a remaining term to maturity closest to the Index Maturity and in an amount of at least U.S. $100 million: the offered rates as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date, of three leading primary United States government securities dealers in The City of New York, selected using the same method described in clause (iii) above;
(v)
if three or four (but not five) reference dealers are quoting as described in clauses (iii) and (iv) above, then the CMT Rate will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of those quotations will be eliminated; and
(vi)
if fewer than three leading primary United States government securities dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as described in clauses (iii) and (iv) above, the CMT Rate will be the CMT Rate in effect during the prior interest period.
        "Designated CMT Telerate Page" means the display on the Moneyline Telerate, Inc., or any successor service, on the page specified on the face hereof, or any other page that replaces that page on that service for the purpose of displaying Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519).

        In addition to the Base Rates specified in this Section, the Company may elect to designate such Other Base Rates indicated on the face hereof based on such other interest rate formula or formulas indicated on the face hereof, which may include a combination of one or more of the Base Rates indicated above.
Indexed Notes
        This Note may be issued with the principal amount payable at Maturity and/or with interest payable hereon on an Interest Payment Date to be determined by reference to the price or prices of currencies, currency units, commodities, stock, other securities, interest or other notes, financial or non-financial indices or other factors (each an "Indexed Note"), as shall be indicated above under "Other Terms." Specific information pertaining to the method for determining the principal amount payable at Maturity or the amount of interest to be paid on an Interest Payment Date with reference to the specified index shall be included above under "Other Terms."
        For the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite principal amount of Indexed Notes outstanding have made a demand or given a notice or waiver or taken any other action, the outstanding principal amount of Indexed Notes will be deemed to be the face amount of the Indexed Notes. In the event of an acceleration of the maturity of the Indexed Note, the principal amount payable to the Holder of an Indexed Note upon acceleration will be the principal amount determined by reference to the formula by which the principal amount of the Indexed Note would be determined on the Maturity Date, as if the date of acceleration were the Maturity Date.
Dual Currency Notes
        This Note may be issued as a Note in which the Company has a one-time option to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on this Note in an optional currency specified on the face hereof under "Other Terms") that is a different currency from the Specified Currency of this Note ("Dual Currency Notes").

Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the Company may exercise such option by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to an Optional Reset Date. Not later than
40 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to such Optional Reset Date, the Trustee will mail to the Holder hereof a notice (the "Reset Notice"), first class, postage prepaid, setting forth (i) the election of the Company to reset the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, (ii) such new Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, and (iii) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional Reset Date or, if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated Maturity of this Note (each such period a "Subsequent Interest Period"), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during such Subsequent Interest Period.

Such notice shall be irrevocable. If the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier is reset on an Optional Reset Date this Note will bear such higher Spread and/or Spread Multiplier.
        If the Company elects to reset the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier of this Note, the Holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment of this Note by the Company on any Optional Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus any accrued interest to such Optional Reset Date.

Extension of Stated Maturity
        If the Company has the option to extend the Stated Maturity of this Note for one or more periods (each an "Extension Period") up to but not beyond the date (the "Final Maturity Date") set forth on the face hereof, such option will be indicated on the face hereof together with the basis or formula, if any, for setting the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier applicable to any such Extension Period. The Company may exercise such option with respect to this Note by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to the Stated Maturity in effect prior to the exercise of such option (the "Original Stated Maturity"). No later than 40 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to the Original Stated Maturity, the Trustee will mail to the Holder hereof a notice (the "Extension Notice") relating to such Extension Period, first class, postage prepaid, setting forth (i) the election of the Company to extend the Stated Maturity hereof, (ii) the new Stated Maturity, (iii) the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier applicable to the Extension Period, and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the Extension Period, including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Extension Period.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to the Original Stated Maturity for this Note, the Company may, at its option, revoke the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher Spread and/or Spread Multiplier for the Extension Period by mailing or causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher Spread and/or Spread Multiplier first class, postage prepaid, to the Holder hereof. Such
notice shall be irrevocable. All Notes with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher Spread and/or Spread Multiplier for the Extension Period.
        If the Company elects to extend the Stated Maturity of this Note, the Holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment of this Note by the Company at the Original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount hereof plus any accrued interest to such date. In order for this Note to be so repaid on the Original Stated Maturity, the Holder hereof must follow the procedures set forth below for optional repurchase, except that the period for delivery of this Note or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days (unless otherwise specified on the face hereof) prior to the Original Stated Maturity and except that a Holder who has tendered this Note for repurchase pursuant to an Extension Notice may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke any such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth day prior to the Original Stated Maturity.

All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).
Calculation of Exchange Rates
        If this is a Foreign Currency Note to be paid in United States dollars, the United States dollar amount to be received in respect hereof will be based upon the exchange rate as determined by the Exchange Rate Agent based on the most favorable firm bid quotation for United States dollars received by such Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers in The City of New York selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) for the purchase by the quoting dealer, for settlement on such payment date, of the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable on such payment date in respect of this Note. If three quoting dealers are not available, then two dealers will be used. If no such bid quotations are available, payments will be made in the Specified Currency, unless such Specified Currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or to other circumstances beyond the Company's control, in which case the Company will be entitled to make payments in respect hereof in United States dollars as provided in the manner set forth below. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder hereof by deductions from such payments. The determination of the exchange rate pursuant to the provisions of this Section is referred to herein as the "Market Exchange Rate."
Payments in Specified Currencies
        If a Holder is to receive payments in a Specified Currency other than United States dollars as described on the face hereof, payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest will be paid in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account maintained by the Holder with a bank designated by the Holder (which in the case of Global Securities will be the Depositary or its nominee) on or prior to the Regular Record Date or at least 15 days prior to Maturity, as the case may be, in the case of Certificated Securities, or in the case of Global Securities, in the manner specified on the face hereof in the third paragraph thereof following the summary of terms, provided that such bank has the appropriate facilities for such a payment in the Specified Currency, provided, however, that with respect to payments of principal and premium, if any, and interest at Maturity this Note is presented to
the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such payment in accordance with its normal procedures, which shall require presentation no later than two Business Days prior to Maturity in order to ensure the availability of immediately available funds in the Specified Currency at Maturity.
        If payment on this Note is required to be made in a Specified Currency other than United States dollars and such currency is unavailable in the good faith judgment of the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or to other circumstances beyond the Company's control, or is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments with respect to this Note shall be made in United States dollars until such currency is again available or so used. The amount so payable on any date in such Specified Currency shall be converted into United States dollars at a rate determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate on the second Business Day prior to such payment, or, if the Market Exchange Rate is not then available, the most recently available Market Exchange Rate or as otherwise determined in good faith by the Company if the foregoing is impracticable.
        If this is a Foreign Currency Note, in the event of an official redenomination of such foreign currency (including, without limitation, an official redenomination of a foreign currency that is a composite currency) the obligations of the Company with respect to payments on this Note denominated in such currency shall, in all cases, be deemed immediately following such redenomination to provide for the payment of that amount of redenominated currency representing the amount of such obligations immediately before such redenomination. No adjustment will be made to any amount payable under this Note as a result of (a) any change in the value of a foreign currency relative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates or (b) any redenomination of any component currency of any composite currency (unless such composite currency is itself officially redenominated).
Acceleration upon an Event of Default
        If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the Principal Amount of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, if any Original Issue Discount Note (as defined below) is redeemed or repurchased by the Company or repurchased at the option of the Holder, each as described above, or if the principal of any Original Issue Discount Note is declared to be due and payable immediately pursuant to this paragraph, the amount of principal due and payable with respect to this Note shall be limited to the sum of the aggregate principal amount of this Note multiplied by the Issue Price (expressed as a percentage of the aggregate principal amount) plus the original issue discount accrued from the date of issue to the date of redemption, repayment or declaration, as applicable, which accrual shall be calculated using the "interest method" (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) in effect on the date of redemption, repurchase or declaration. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, an Original Issue Discount Note is a Note which has a stated redemption price at maturity that exceeds its Issue Price by at least 0.25% of the stated redemption price at maturity, multiplied by the number of full years from the Original Issue Date to the Maturity Date for this Note.
Modification of Rights under the Indenture
        The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes of each series at the time
Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. In addition, the Indenture permits the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the notes of each series to be affected under the Indenture by the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes of each series to be affected, under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture.
        No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. However, the Indenture limits the Holder's right to enforce the Indenture and this Note.
Transfers of Notes
        As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein and as may be set forth on the face hereof, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series of like tenor, of Authorized Denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
        1.
    Introduction.
    Hewlett-Packard Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer"), confirms its agreement with each of you (individually an "Agent" and collectively the "Agents") with respect to the issue and sale from time to time by the Issuer on or after the date hereof of up to $1,500,000,000 in aggregate initial offering price of its Medium-Term Notes, Series B, Due Nine Months or More from the Date of Issue (or for Medium-Term Notes, Series B, Due Nine Months or More from the Date of Issue, denominated in currencies or currency units other than U.S. dollars, the equivalent thereof based on the prevailing exchange rates at the respective times such Medium-Term Notes, Series B Due Nine Months or More from the Date of Issue are first offered) (the "Notes") as set forth herein.
        On the basis of the representations and warranties contained herein but subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and to the reservation by the Issuer of the right to sell Notes directly to investors (other than broker-dealers who have not executed this Agreement or otherwise agreed to the terms contained herein) on its own behalf, the Issuer hereby (i) appoints each of the Agents as an agent of the Issuer for the purpose of soliciting offers to purchase the Notes from the Issuer and
(ii) agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated herein, whenever it determines to sell Notes directly to any of the Agents as principal for resale to others, it will enter into a separate agreement, which may be a written agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto or an oral agreement confirmed in writing by such Agent (each a "Terms Agreement") relating to such sale in accordance with Section 3(f) hereof.
        The terms and rights of the Notes shall be as specified in or established pursuant to the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2000, as supplemented to the date hereof (the "Senior Indenture"), between the Issuer and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor to Chase Manhattan Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes shall have the maturity ranges, annual interest rates, redemption provisions, if any and other terms set forth in the Prospectus referred to below as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time by the Issuer in accordance with the Senior Indenture and the Procedures (as defined below) or as otherwise agreed upon and, if applicable, will be specified in a related Terms Agreement.
        2.
    Representations and Warranties of the Issuer.
    The Issuer represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Agents that as of the Closing Date, each Representation Date, each Time of Delivery and each date on which the Issuer accepts an offer to purchase Notes from an Agent as follows:
        (a)  The registration statement of the Issuer (No. 333-83346) relating to securities of the Issuer (collectively the "Registered Securities"), including the Notes, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and has become effective and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Issuer, threatened (such registration statement, as amended as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3(e) hereof), including all material incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Registration Statement" and the related prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as supplemented as of the Closing Date, including all material incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus"). Any reference in this Agreement to amending or supplementing the Prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of materials incorporated by reference in the Prospectus after the Closing Date and any reference in this Agreement to any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus shall be deemed to include any such materials incorporated by reference in the Prospectus after the Closing Date.
        (b)  (i) On the effective date of the Registration Statement (the "Effective Date"), such Registration Statement complied, and on the Closing Date the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and the rules thereunder; (ii) on the Effective Date and on the Closing Date the Senior Indenture did or will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the rules thereunder; (iii) on the Effective Date the Registration Statement did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and (iv) on the Effective Date, the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Prospectus did not or will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary, in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; except that the foregoing clauses (iii) and (iv) do not apply to statements in or omissions from any of such documents based upon written information furnished to the Issuer by any Agent specifically for use therein or that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee.
        (c)  The Senior Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and constitutes a valid and binding obligation enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally from time to time in effect, and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and subject to limitations on rights to indemnification and contribution under applicable law or equitable principles); and the Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the purchasers thereof pursuant to this Agreement, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer entitled to the benefits of the Senior Indenture (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally from time to time in effect, and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and subject to limitations on rights to indemnification and contribution under applicable law or equitable principles).
        (d)  None of the issue and sale of the Notes, the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated or the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, (i) the charter or by-laws of the Issuer or (ii) the terms of any Material Agreement, or (iii) any decree or regulation or order applicable to the Issuer of any U.S. federal, California or Delaware court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Issuer, except where the conflict or breach of which in clause (ii) or clause (iii) above would not have a material adverse effect on the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. "Material Agreements" means: (X) all agreements filed as Exhibits to the Issuer's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and (Y) all agreements filed as Exhibits to the Issuer's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K subsequent to the date of the Issuer's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, in each case (X) and (Y) filed pursuant to clause (2), (4), (9) or (10) of paragraph (b) of Item 601 of Regulation S-K (in the case of Form 10-K or Form 10-Q) (but only such agreements that continue to be in effect).
        (e)  The Issuer has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with full corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of the State of California.

        (h)  Immediately after any sale of Notes by the Issuer hereunder or under any applicable Terms Agreement, the aggregate amount of Notes which shall have been issued and sold by the Issuer hereunder or under any Terms Agreement taken together with any other securities of the Issuer (other than the Notes) that shall have been issued and sold pursuant to the Registration Statement will not exceed the amount of securities registered under the Registration Statement.

        3.
    Appointment as Agent; Solicitations as Agent; Purchases as Principal.
    
        (a)  On the basis of the representations and warranties contained herein but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Issuer hereby appoints each of the Agents an agent of the Issuer for the purpose of soliciting or receiving offers to purchase the Notes from the Issuer by others. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Issuer from selling at any time to any person any Registered Securities, including the Notes, directly on its own behalf or in a firm commitment underwriting pursuant to an underwriting agreement that does not provide for a continuous offering of such Notes or pursuant to a private placement not constituting a public offering under the Act. Each Agent, severally and not jointly, agrees to use its reasonable efforts to solicit purchases of the Notes on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Procedures (as defined below), but shall have complete discretion as to the manner in which it solicits purchasers for the Notes and as to the identity thereof.
        The Issuer reserves the right to sell, and may solicit and accept offers to purchase, Notes directly on its own behalf and, in the case of any such sale not resulting from a solicitation made by any Agent, no commission will be payable with respect to such sale.
        (b)  On the basis of the representations and warranties contained herein, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each Agent agrees, as agent of the Issuer, to solicit offers to purchase the Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus, as from time to time amended or supplemented.
        Upon receipt of notice from the Issuer as contemplated by Section 4(b) hereof, the Agents shall suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes until such time as the Issuer shall have furnished them with an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, contemplated by Section 4(b) and shall have advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.
        The Issuer reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently. As soon as practicable, but in any event not later than one business day in New York City, after receipt of notice from the Issuer, the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes from the Issuer until such time as the Issuer has advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed. During any such period, the Issuer shall not be required to comply with the provisions of Sections 6(a), 6(b), 6(c) and 6(d), provided that if the Registration Statement or Prospectus is amended or supplemented during the period of suspension (other than an amendment or supplement (i) that solely specifies or provides for a change in maturity dates, interest rates, issuance prices or similar terms of any particular Notes sold hereunder, (ii) by means of the filing of materials incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than the Issuer's Annual Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q), (iii) relating to an offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities other than the Notes or (iv) that is a pricing amendment or supplement relating to Notes the purchase of which was not solicited by an Agent) no Agent shall be required to resume soliciting offers to purchase Notes until the Issuer has delivered to such Agent, such opinions, letters and certificates with respect to any Representation Date (as defined in Section 6(b)) specified in Sections 6(b), (c) and (d).
        Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Issuer and the Agent soliciting such offer, the Agents are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Notes only in fully registered form in denominations of $1,000 or any multiple thereof. The Issuer will determine the authorized denominations of Notes not denominated in U.S. dollars at the time of sale. Each Agent shall
communicate to the Issuer, orally or in writing, each reasonable offer to purchase the Notes received by it as Agent. The Issuer shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Notes and may reject any such offer, in whole or in part. Each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, without notice to the Issuer, to reject any offer to purchase the Notes received by it, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreement contained herein.
        No Note that the Issuer has agreed to sell pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been purchased and paid for, or sold, by the Issuer until such Note shall have been delivered to the purchaser thereof against payment by such purchaser.
        (c)  The Issuer agrees to pay the presenting Agent (or jointly to two or more Agents if such presentation is jointly made) a commission, at the time of settlement of each sale of a Note by the Issuer as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, in an amount equal to the following percentage of the principal amount of such Note sold or such other amount as may be agreed to in writing from time to time:
        (d)  Administrative procedures respecting the sale of Notes (the "Procedures") shall be agreed upon from time to time by the Agents and the Issuer. The initial Procedures, which are set forth in Exhibit B hereto, shall remain in effect until changed only by written agreement among the Issuer and the respective Agents. The provisions of the Procedures shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder except as otherwise specified in a Terms Agreement. Each Agent and the Issuer agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each of them herein and in the Procedures. The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee a copy of the Procedures as from time to time in effect.
        (e)  The documents required to be delivered by Section 5 hereof shall be delivered at the offices of the Issuer in Palo Alto, California, or counsel for the Issuer in Palo Alto, California, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of this Agreement or at such other place, and at such later time and date as may be mutually agreed by the Issuer and the Agents, but in no event later than the day prior to the date on which solicitation of offers to purchase Notes is commenced or the first date on which the Issuer accepts an offer by any Agent to purchase Notes as principal, such time and date being herein called the "Closing Date."
        (f)    From time to time, any Agent may agree with the Issuer to purchase Notes from the Issuer as principal. In such case the purchasing Agent and the Issuer may set forth the terms of such purchase in a separate Terms Agreement to be entered into between such Agent and the Issuer. Upon acceptance by the Issuer of an offer to purchase Notes, unless the Issuer and the
purchasing Agent otherwise agree in writing, any such Terms Agreement or other written confirmation or communication transmitted by the purchasing Agent to the Issuer or, in the absence of a Terms Agreement or other written confirmation or communication from the purchasing Agent, the oral agreement confirmed in writing by such Agent with respect to the terms of the Notes and of their offer and sale evidenced by the offer communicated by the purchasing Agent and accepted by the Issuer, in each case together with the provisions of this Agreement, shall constitute an agreement between the purchasing Agent and the Issuer for the sale and purchase of such Notes (whether or not any Terms Agreement or other written confirmation or communication shall have been executed by the Issuer or the purchasing Agent). In connection with any resale of Notes so purchased, such Notes may be resold by such Agent at varying prices from time to time or at a fixed public offering price or such Agent may use a selling or dealer group. Such Agent may reallow to any broker or dealer any portion of the discount or commission payable pursuant hereto. A Terms Agreement, to the extent set forth therein, may incorporate by reference specified provisions of this Agreement.
        Each agreement by an Agent to purchase Notes as principal (pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise) shall specify the principal amount of Notes to be purchased by such Agent pursuant thereto, the price to be paid to the Issuer for such Notes, the maturity date of such Notes, the interest rate or interest rate basis, if any, applicable to such Notes, any other terms of such Notes, the time and date and place of delivery of and payment for such Notes (the time and date of any and each such delivery and payment, the "Time of Delivery"), any provisions relating to rights of, and default by, underwriters acting together with such Agent in the re-offering of Notes, and shall also specify whether opinions of counsel, accountants' letters and officers' certificates are required pursuant to Section 6 hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent such certificates, accountant letters or opinions specified in Section 6 hereof are required under a Terms Agreement or otherwise with respect to an agreement by an Agent or Agents to purchase Notes directly from the Issuer as a principal, such certificates, letters and opinions of counsel shall be addressed solely to those Agents purchasing such Notes. Unless otherwise specified in a Terms Agreement, the procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of Notes purchased by an Agent as principal and the payment therefore shall be as set forth in the Procedures.
        (g)
    Obligations Several.
    The Issuer acknowledges that the obligations of the Agents are several and not joint.
        4.
    Certain Agreements of the Issuer.
    The Issuer agrees with the Agents that, in connection with each offering of Notes:
        (a)  The Issuer will advise the Agents promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (other than an amendment or supplement (i) that solely specifies or provides for a change in maturity dates, interest rates, issuance prices or similar terms of any particular Notes sold hereunder, (ii) by means of the filing of materials incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, (iii) relating to an offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities other than the Notes or (iv) that is a pricing amendment or supplement relating to Notes the purchase of which was not solicited by any Agent) and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to afford the Agents an opportunity to review any such proposed amendment or supplement prior to filing; the Issuer will also advise the Agents of the filing of any such amendment or supplement. Following any such filing, each Agent shall have the right to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Notes until such time as such Agent shall reasonably determine that solicitation of purchases may be resumed and any such suspension shall not be deemed a breach of such Agent's agreement contained herein. The Issuer will also advise the Agents of the institution by the SEC of any stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its withdrawal, if issued.
        (b)  If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder ("Rules and Regulations") (other than as contemplated in the parenthetical clause of Section 4(a) hereof), the Issuer will promptly notify each Agent (i) in its capacity as agent of the Issuer to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes (and, if so notified, such Agent shall cease such solicitations as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than one business day later); and (ii) to cease sales of any Notes such Agent may then own as principal; and if the Issuer shall decide so to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, it will promptly advise each Agent and will promptly prepare and file with the SEC an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. If, at the time of any notification to suspend solicitations, any Agent shall own any of the Notes with the intention of reselling them as contemplated by Section 3(f) hereof, or the Issuer has accepted an offer to purchase Notes but the related settlement has not occurred, the Issuer, subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section, will promptly repurchase any Notes so held by such Agent, cancel such offer (to the extent such cancellation may be lawfully effected) or promptly prepare and file with the SEC an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance, and will supply such amended or supplemented Prospectus to the respective Agents in such quantities as they may reasonably request. If such amendment or supplement and the documents, opinions, letters and certificates furnished to the Agents pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the preparation and filing of such amendment or supplement are, in the judgment of the Agents, satisfactory, then upon the filing with the SEC of such amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or upon the effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement, the Agents will resume the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes hereunder; provided, however, that if one or more Agents does not find such amendment or supplement acceptable, in their judgment, such Agent shall not be required to recommence the solicitation of offers hereunder and such other Agents for which such amendment or supplement was satisfactory shall not be precluded from recommencing the solicitation of offers pursuant to this Agreement.
        (c)  The Issuer, during the period when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
        (d)  The Issuer will furnish to each Agent copies of the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements thereto, and all amendments to the Registration Statement after the date hereof (other than an amendment or supplement (i) that solely specifies or provides for a change in maturity dates, interest rates, issuance prices or similar terms of any particular Notes sold hereunder, (ii) by means of the filing of materials incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, (iii) relating to an offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities other than the Notes or (iv) that is a pricing amendment or supplement relating to Notes the purchase of which was not solicited by any Agent), in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as are reasonably requested.
        (e)  The Issuer will arrange for the qualification of the Notes for sale and under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Agents through Cravath, Swaine & Moore (the "Agents' Counsel") reasonably requests and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the
distribution of the Notes;
provided
that in connection therewith the Issuer shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction or to file a consent or otherwise subject itself to service of process or taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not already so subject.
        (f)    So long as any Notes are outstanding, if so requested by the Agents, the Issuer will furnish to the Agents, to the extent such document is not available pursuant to the EDGAR filing system, (i) as soon as available, a copy of each report or definitive proxy statement of the Issuer, if any, filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and (ii) from time to time, such other information concerning the Issuer as the Agents may reasonably request, which may be provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
        (g)  The Issuer will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse the Agents for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of Agents' Counsel, subject to the limitation set forth below) reasonably incurred by them in connection with qualification of the Notes for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as such Agents may reasonably request in accordance with Section 4(e) hereof and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Notes, for expenses incurred in distributing the Prospectus and all supplements thereto, any preliminary prospectuses and any preliminary prospectus supplements, to each Agent and for the reasonable fees and disbursements of Agents' Counsel in connection with the establishment of the program contemplated hereby, such reasonable fees and disbursements of Agents' Counsel not to exceed $35,000. The Agents shall pay all other fees and expenses incurred by the Agents.
        (h)  The Issuer will make generally available to its security holders and to the Agent as soon as practicable earnings statements which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 of the SEC promulgated thereunder covering periods of at least twelve months beginning in each case with the first fiscal quarter of the Issuer occurring after the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158) of the Registration Statement with respect to each sale of Notes.
        (i)    In the case of a purchase of Notes by an Agent as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise, if called for by the applicable Terms Agreement or other agreement, at the corresponding Time of Delivery, the Issuer will, from the date of any applicable Terms Agreement with an Agent or other agreement by an Agent to purchase Notes as principal and continuing to and including the business day following the related Time of Delivery, not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of or guaranteed by the Issuer which are substantially similar to the Notes, without the prior written consent of such Agent; provided, however, that for the purposes of the foregoing, any reverse inquiry solicitations of or solicitations by the Agents as contemplated hereby will not constitute an offer by the Issuer.

        (d)  At the Closing Date, the Agents (and in the case of a purchase of Notes by an Agent or Agents as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise, if called for by the applicable Terms Agreement or other agreement, at the corresponding Time of Delivery, such Agent or Agents) shall have received:
          (i)  the opinion of the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel of the Issuer (either of the foregoing, "Issuer Counsel"), or an outside counsel for the Issuer, dated the Closing Date, substantially to the effect that:
        (A)  the Issuer has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with full corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, except where the failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect on the Issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

        (D)  the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto have become effective under the Act; any required filing of the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened under the Act;
        (E)  this Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer;
        (F)  no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to, consent of, order of, or filing with, any U.S. federal, California or Delaware governmental authority or agency is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been obtained under the Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained; and
        (G)  none of the issue and sale of the Notes, the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated or the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, the charter or by-laws of the Issuer or, to such counsel's knowledge, the terms of any Material Agreement, or any material decree or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Issuer of any U.S. federal, California or Delaware court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Issuer.
        Such opinion shall also include a statement that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Issuer, counsel for the Issuer, the independent accountants of the Issuer, the Agents and counsel for the Agents, at which the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the statements contained therein and has made no independent check or verification thereof, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that has caused such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except the financial statements and the notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view) were not appropriately responsive in all material respects with requirements of the Act, the rules thereunder and the Trust Indenture Act and (ii) (A) the Registration Statement at the effective date thereof contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (B) that the Prospectus as of its date and on the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case except for the financial statements and the notes thereto and the financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view); and
        (ii)  in the event that any of the statements described in the foregoing subsection 5(d)(i) are omitted from the opinion delivered pursuant to such subsection, the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, counsel for the Issuer, dated the Closing Date, to the effect of the statements so omitted.
        In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California or the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Agents; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Issuer or public officials. Furthermore, such counsel shall provide any opinions as to enforceability based upon laws then in effect in the State of New York.
        (e)  At the Closing Date, the Agents (and in the case of a purchase of Notes by an Agent as a principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise, if called for by the applicable Terms Agreement or other agreement, at the corresponding Time for Delivery, such Agent) shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, signed by an officer of the Issuer reasonably acceptable to the applicable Agents to the effect that (i) the representations and warranties of the Issuer in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, (ii) the Issuer has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date in all material respects, (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Issuer's knowledge, threatened by the SEC, and (iv) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the financial position or results of operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Prospectus or as described in such certificate.
        (f)    At the Closing Date, the Agents (and in the case of a purchase of Notes by an Agent or Agents as a principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise, if and to the extent called for by the applicable Terms Agreement or other agreement, at the corresponding Time of Delivery, such Agent or Agents) shall have received a letter, dated such date, of E&Y confirming that they are independent auditors within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published Rules and Regulations thereunder adopted by the SEC, stating or affirming substantially in effect that:
          (i)  in their opinion the financial statements and financial statement schedules audited by such accountants and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations adopted by the SEC;
        (ii)  on the basis of: (W) performing the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of the interim financial information as described in SAS 71,
Interim Financial Information
, on the unaudited interim financial statements from the date of the latest audited balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus to the date of the latest interim balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus; (X) inquiries of Issuer's management who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether the unaudited interim financial statements comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC and are stated on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference
in the Registration Statement; (Y) carrying out certain specified procedures on the latest interim financial data made available (but not an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; and (Z) a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareowners, board of directors and related committees for the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus: nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (a) any such unaudited interim financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and with the related published rules and regulations adopted by the SEC; (b) any material modifications should be made to said unaudited interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; and (c) said unaudited interim financial statements were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; and
        (iii)  they have performed certain other procedures as a result of which they determined that the information described in a schedule to be delivered to the applicable Agents in connection with such letter, of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information that has been obtained from accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation) set forth in the Registration Statement, as amended, the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement (including selected accounting, financial or statistical information included therein), agrees with accounting records or compilations made from such accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation.
        References to the Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any supplements thereto at the date of the letter.
        (g)  At the Closing Date, the Agents (and in the case of a purchase of Notes by an Agent as a principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise, if called for by the applicable Terms Agreement or other agreement, at the corresponding Time for Delivery such Agent) shall have received from the Agents' Counsel, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date or the Time for Delivery, as applicable, with respect to the validity of the Notes, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as they may reasonably require, and the Issuer shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
        (h)  At the Closing Date, on or after the trade date and prior to the related settlement date with respect to any particular issuance of Notes, or on or after the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, and prior to the trade date with respect to any particular issuance of the Notes, in each case whether such issuance is on an agency basis or principal basis, there shall not have occurred, except as reflected in or contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, any material adverse change in the financial condition of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
        6.
    Additional Covenants of the Issuer.
    The Issuer agrees that:
        (a)  Each acceptance by the Issuer of an offer for the purchase of Notes solicited by any Agent or a purchase of Notes by an Agent as principal, pursuant hereto shall be deemed to be an
affirmation to the applicable Agent, that the Issuer's representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects at the time of such acceptance and a covenant that such representations and warranties will be true and correct in all material respects at the Time of Delivery to the purchaser of the Notes relating to such acceptance as though made at and as of each such time, it being understood that such representations and warranties shall relate to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at each such time.
        (b)  Each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by an amendment or supplement: (i) that relates to an offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities other than the Notes; (ii) that solely specifies or provides for a change in the maturity dates, interest rates, issuance prices or other similar terms of any particular Notes sold hereunder; (iii) relating to any filing under the Exchange Act (except for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K filed thereunder); and (iv) by any pricing supplement) (each such time and subject to the foregoing exceptions, being herein referred to as a "Representation Date"), the Issuer shall, promptly following such amendment or supplement, furnish the Agents with a certificate, dated the date of delivery thereof, signed by an officer of the Issuer to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate covering the matters set forth in Section 5(e) hereof which was last furnished to the Agents are true and correct in all material respects at the time of such amendment or supplement as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such time and except that the statements contained in the certificate covering the matters set forth in clause (ii) of Section 5(e) shall be deemed to relate to the time of delivery of such certificate) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same tenor as the certificate referred to in Section 5(e), modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at the time of delivery of such certificate and, in the case of the matters set forth in clause (ii) of Section 5(e), to the time of delivery of such certificate.
        (c)  At each Representation Date, the Issuer shall promptly thereafter furnish the Agents with a written opinion or opinions, dated the date of such Representation Date, of Issuer Counsel or Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, substantially to the effect set forth in Section 5(d) hereof, but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such Representation Date;
provided, however
, that in lieu of such opinion or opinions, counsel may furnish the Agents with a letter or letters to the effect that the Agents may rely on a prior opinion delivered under Section 5(d) or this Section 6(c) to the same extent as if it were dated the date of such letter (except that statements in such prior opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such Representation Date).
        (d)  At each Representation Date, the Issuer shall cause its independent accountants promptly thereafter to furnish the Agents with a letter, addressed jointly to the Issuer and the Agents and dated the date of such Representation Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, substantially to the effect set forth in Section 5(f)(i), (ii) (excluding subpart (Y)) and (iii) hereof with respect to the respective matters covered therein but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such Representation Date, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Issuer.
        (e)  The Issuer agrees that any obligation of a person who has agreed to purchase Notes as the result of solicitation by any Agent pursuant hereto to make payment for and take delivery of such Notes shall be subject to the satisfaction, on such settlement date, of each of the conditions set forth in Sections 5(a), (b) and (c) (it being understood that the judgment of such person with respect to the impracticability or inadvisability of such purchase of Notes shall be substituted, for
purposes of this Section 6(e), for the respective judgments of an Agent with respect to certain matters referred to in Section 5(c) and that such Agent shall have no duty or obligation whatsoever to exercise the judgment permitted under Section 5(c) on behalf of any such person).
        7.
    Indemnification and Contribution.
    
        (a)  The Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, each affiliate (within the meaning of the Exchange Act) of an Agent and their respective officers, directors and employees, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or State statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement relating to the Notes as originally filed or in any amendment thereto, or in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Issuer will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer by any Agent specifically for use therein and (ii) such indemnity with respect to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Agent (or any person controlling such Agent) through which the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Notes which are the subject thereof if (A) such person did not receive a copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented), excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the earlier of the confirmation of the sale of such Notes or the delivery of the Notes to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to or at the time of the confirmation of the sale of such Notes to such person) and (B) the Issuer had previously furnished copies of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to or at the time of the confirmation of the sale of the Notes to such person) to such Agent. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Issuer may otherwise have.
        (b)  Each Agent severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, each affiliate (within the meaning of the Exchange Act) of the Issuer and their respective officers and directors, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuer to such Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to such Agent furnished to the Issuer by such Agent specifically for use in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that such Agent may otherwise have.
        (c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to appoint counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent the indemnified party in such action;
provided
,
however
, if the defendants in any such action include both the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel), approved by the Agents in the case of subparagraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) of this Section 7 who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity was sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action.
        (d)  In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason unavailable or insufficient, the Issuer and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Issuer and one or more of the Agents may be subject (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuer on the one hand and the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability relates or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuer on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuer on the one hand and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) to which such loss, claim, damage or liability relates, received by the Issuer bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Agents in connection therewith. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer or the Agents and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (X) in no case shall any Agent (except as may be provided in any agreement among Agents relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the discount applicable to the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability relates, purchased by such Agent hereunder and (Y) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For
purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Agent within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each person who controls the Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Issuer who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Issuer shall have the same rights to contribution as the Issuer, subject in each case to clauses (X) and (Y) of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify in writing such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
        8.
    Status of Each Agent.
    
        (a)  In soliciting offers to purchase the Notes from the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement and in assuming its other obligations hereunder (other than offers to purchase pursuant to Section 3(f) hereof), each Agent is acting solely as agent for the Issuer and not as principal. Each Agent will make its reasonable best efforts to assist the Issuer in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes from the Issuer has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Issuer, but such Agent shall have no liability to the Issuer in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Issuer shall default on its obligations to deliver Notes to a purchaser who has agreed to purchase Notes as a result of solicitation by any Agent pursuant hereto, and whose offer the Issuer has accepted, the Issuer (i) shall hold the Agents harmless against any loss, claim or damages arising from or as a result of such default by the Issuer, and (ii) in particular, shall pay to the Agents any commission to which they would be entitled in connection with such sale.
        (b)  Subject to Section 4(g) hereof, if this Agreement or any Terms Agreement shall be terminated by an Agent or Agents because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Issuer to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, the Issuer agrees to reimburse each Agent or such Agents as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of Agents' Counsel) reasonably incurred by such Agent or Agents in connection with this Agreement or the offering of Notes.
        9.
    Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.
    The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Issuer or its officers and of the Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement and any Terms Agreement if specified therein, will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Agent, the Issuer or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes. In the event of any suspension of the solicitation of offers in accordance with this Agreement or termination of this Agreement in its entirety or with respect to a particular Agent or Agents, no party shall have any liability to any other party hereto, except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 or for any other reason, the Issuer and the Agents shall remain responsible for their respective expenses pursuant to Section 4(g) and the respective obligations of the Issuer and the Agents pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect and except as set forth in the following sentence. In addition, if any such termination shall occur either (i) at a time when any Agent shall own any of the Notes with the intention of reselling them as contemplated by Section 3(f) hereof or (ii) after the Issuer has accepted an offer to purchase Notes solicited by any Agent pursuant hereto and prior to the related settlement, the obligations of the Issuer under the last sentence of Section 4(b), under Sections 4(a), 4(c), 4(d),
4(e), 6(a), and 6(e) and, in the case of a termination occurring as described in (ii) above, under Section 3(c) and under the last sentence of Section 8, shall also remain in effect.
        10.
    Termination.
    This Agreement may be terminated for any reason at any time by the Issuer as to any Agent or, in the case of any Agent, by such Agent insofar as this Agreement relates to such Agent, upon the giving of one day's written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto. Any settlement with respect to Notes placed by an Agent occurring after termination of this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the Procedures and each Agent agrees, if requested by the Issuer, to take the steps therein provided to be taken by such Agent in connection with such settlement.
        11.
    Appointment of Additional Agents.
    The Issuer, in its sole discretion, may appoint one or more additional parties to act as Agents hereunder from time to time. Any such appointment shall be made in writing signed by the Issuer and the party so appointed. Such appointment shall become effective in accordance with its terms after the execution and delivery of such writing by the Issuer and such other party. When such appointment is effective, such other party shall be deemed to be one of the Agents referred to in, and to have the rights and obligations of an Agent under, this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of such appointment. The Issuer shall deliver a copy of such appointment to the Agents promptly after it becomes effective.
        12.
