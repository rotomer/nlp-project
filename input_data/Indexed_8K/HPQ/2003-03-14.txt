The Company may have filed one or more amendments thereto, including the related preliminary prospectus, and may have filed a preliminary prospectus in accordance with Rules 415 and 424(b), each of which has previously been furnished to you (if so filed).  The Company will next file with the Commission one of the following: (i) prior to effectiveness of such registration statement, a further amendment thereto, including the form of final prospectus, (ii) after the Effective Date of such registration statement, a final prospectus in accordance with Rules 430A and 424(b)(1) or (4), or (iii) a final prospectus in accordance with Rules 415 and 424(b)(2) or (5).  In the case of clause (ii), the Company has included in such registration statement or statements, as amended at the Effective Date, all information (other than Rule 430A Information) required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be included in the Prospectus with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof.  As filed, such amendment and form of final prospectus, or such final prospectus, shall include all Rule 430A Information and, except to the extent the

"Rule 430A Information" means information with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof permitted to be omitted from the Registration Statement when it becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A.  Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, a Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include such portions of documents as are specifically incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement, or the date of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

(d)           None of the issue and sale of the Securities, the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated or the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, (i) the charter or by-laws of the Company or (ii) the terms of any material indenture or other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a party or bound, or (iii) any decree or regulation or order applicable to the Company of any U.S. federal or California or
Delaware court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Company, except where the conflict or breach of which in clause (ii) or clause (iii) above would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
2. .

Agreements
The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
(a)           The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement, and any amendment thereof, if not effective at the Execution Time, to become effective.  If the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will file the Prospectus, properly completed, pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing.  The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Registration Statement shall have become effective (if not already effective), (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement relating to the Securities shall have become effective (if not already effective),  (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution
or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose, (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and (vi) when the Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) by the Company.  The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.  The Company will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus relating to the Securities unless the Company has afforded you the opportunity to review it prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably and timely object.
(b)           If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the rules thereunder in any material respect, the Company will give the Representatives prompt notice of the occurrence of such event and promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance.
(c)           To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act) an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158).
(d)           The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date (and the Company will furnish to counsel for the Underwriters a photocopy of one signed copy of the Registration Statement (including exhibits and amendments)) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(e)           The Company will take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably request, and to maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction or
to file a consent or otherwise subject itself to service of process or taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not already so subject.
(f)            Until the earlier of the day on which the distribution of the Securities is completed or the business day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any debt securities covered by the Registration Statement or any other registration statement filed under the Act which mature more than one year after the date hereof and which are substantially similar to such debt securities, except any proposed issuances of debt securities with respect to which the Company has advised the Representatives in writing prior to the execution hereof.
(g)           The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action intended to result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
The several Underwriters agree with the Company that:
(a)           The Company will pay the expenses of printing and producing all documents relating to the offering.
(b)           The Company will pay the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of outside counsel for the Company and the Trustee relating to the offering.

(e)           The several Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes or resale of any of the Securities by them and any advertising expenses in connection with any offers they make.

(F)   no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to, consent of, order of, or filing with, any U.S. federal or California or Delaware governmental authority or agency is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been obtained under the Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained; and
(G)   none of the issue and sale of the Securities, the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated or the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, the charter or by-laws of the Company or, to such counsel's knowledge, the terms of any Material Agreements, or any material decree or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company of any U.S. federal or California or Delaware court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Company.  "Material Agreements" means all agreements filed as exhibits to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to clause (10) of paragraph (b) of Item 601 of Regulation S-K (but only such agreements that continue to be in effect).
Such opinion shall also include a statement that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, counsel for the Company, the independent accountants of the Company and the Underwriters at which the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the statements contained therein and has made no independent check or verification thereof, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that has caused such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except the financial statements and the notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view) were not appropriately responsive in all material respects with requirements of the Act and the rules thereunder and (ii) the Registration Statement at the Effective Date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus as of its date and on the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case except for the
financial statements and the notes thereto and the financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view).
Any of the statements described above may be omitted from the opinion of such counsel; provided, however, that in such event the Company shall also have furnished to the Representatives the corresponding opinion or statement of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, counsel for the Company, described in subsection 5(b)(ii) below.
(ii)   In the event that any of the statements described in the foregoing subsection 5(b)(i) are omitted from the opinion delivered pursuant to such subsection, the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect of the statements so omitted.
In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California or the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company or public officials.
(c)           The Representatives shall have received from Cravath, Swaine & Moore, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(d)           The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate signed by an officer of the Company reasonably acceptable to the Representatives, dated the Closing Date, to the effect:
(i)    the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date, in each case, in all material respects, unless otherwise waived by the Representatives;
(ii)   no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii)  since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Prospectus.
(e)           At the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent auditors within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder, stating or affirming in effect that:
(i)    in their opinion the Company's consolidated financial statements and schedules thereto audited by such accountants and included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2002, as incorporated in the Registration Statement or the Preliminary Prospectus, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
(ii)   on the basis of:  (X) performing the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of the interim financial information as described in SAS 71, , on the unaudited interim balance sheet and statement of earnings from the date of the latest audited balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus to the date of the latest interim balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus from Exhibit 99.1 included in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 25, 2003 and filed with the Commission on February 26, 2003; (Y) inquiries of the Company's management who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether the unaudited interim balance sheet and statement of earnings are stated on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; and (Z) a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareowners, board of directors and related committees for the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus: nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that said unaudited interim balance sheet and statement of earnings were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; and
Interim Financial Information
(iii)  they have performed certain other procedures as a result of which they determined that the information described in a schedule to be delivered to the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information that has been obtained from accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation)
set forth in the Registration Statement, as amended, the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement (including selected accounting, financial or statistical information included or therein), agrees with accounting records or compilations made from such accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation.
References to the Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplements thereto at the date of the letter.
(f)            Subsequent to the respective dates of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement on or after the Execution Time), there shall not have been (i) any material change in the capital stock (other than upon exercise of outstanding stock options) or any significant increase in long-term debt of the Company or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering, sale or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
(g)           Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(h)           Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the Securities by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. ("Moody's") or Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P") and neither Moody's nor S&P shall have publicly announced that it has placed any of the Securities on a credit watch with negative implications, except as disclosed prior to the Execution Time.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives.  Notice of such termination shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

(a)           The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives for use in connection with the preparation thereof, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus or supplement thereto shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities which are the subject thereof if (A) such person did not receive a copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as supplemented) excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as supplemented prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person) and (B) the Company had previously furnished copies of the Prospectus to such Underwriter.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
(b)           Each Underwriter severally (and not jointly) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the third and ninth paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" of the Prospectus, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several
Underwriters for inclusion in the Prospectus, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 6.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to appoint counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent the indemnified party in such action; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to appoint counsel to defend such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 6, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity was sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action.
(d)           In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company or the Underwriters on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clauses (y) and (z) of this paragraph (d).  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify in writing such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).  The Underwriters obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth on hereto, and not joint.
Schedule II
7. .  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in hereto bears to the
Default by an Underwriter
Schedule II
aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 7, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Schedule II
8. .  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on The New York Stock Exchange or trading of the Company's common stock on The New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by U.S. federal or New York State authorities, (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing any major disruption of settlements of securities clearance services in the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to proceed with the offering, sale and delivery of the Securities.
Termination
9. .  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company and the Underwriters shall remain responsible for their respective expenses and reimbursements pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect.

Optional Redemption
.
The Company will have the right to redeem the Global Notes, in whole or in part at any time, on at least 30 days but no more than 60 days prior written notice mailed to the registered holders of the Global Notes to be redeemed.  The redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Global Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum, as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined below), of the present value of the principal amount of the Global Notes to be redeemed and the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon from the redemption date to the maturity date (the "Remaining Life") discounted from the scheduled payment dates to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date.
If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Global Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the  Global Notes (or such portion thereof) called for redemption and such Global Notes will cease to be outstanding.  If any redemption date is not a business day, the Company will pay the redemption price on the next business day without any interest or other payment due to the delay.
If fewer than all of the  Global Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the  Global Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems appropriate and fair.  No Global Notes of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part.
For the purposes above:
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the Remaining Life that would be utilized, at the time of selection, and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity with the Remaining Life.

"Quotation Agent" means the Reference Treasury Dealers.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of BNP Paribas Securities Corp., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in The City of New York (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by each Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for the redemption date.
Payment of Additional Amounts
.  The Company will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay to the holder of any Global Note that is a United States Alien (as defined below), as additional interest, such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that every net payment on such Global Note (including payment of the principal of and interest on such Global Note) by the Company or the Company's specified Paying Agent, after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided in such Global Note to be then due and payable. However, the Company's obligation to pay additional amounts will not apply to:
(1)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been so imposed but for:
 - 
                 
the existence of any present or former connection between such holder or beneficial owner of such Global Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor or beneficiary of, or a person holding a power over, such holder, if such holder is an estate or a trust, or a member or shareholder of such holder, if such holder is a partnership or corporation) and the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, including, without limitation, such holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, person holding a power, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident of the United States or treated as a resident thereof or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein; or
 -

(2)           any estate, inheritance, gift, excise, sales, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(3)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the presentation by the holder of a Global Note for payment more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurred later;
(4)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment on a Global Note;
(5)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any Paying Agent from a payment on a Global Note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other Paying Agent;
(6)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a failure to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation, identification or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the holder or beneficial owner of a Global Note if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the United States or an applicable tax treaty to which the United States is a party as precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(7)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed on a holder that actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company;
(8)           any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been imposed or withheld but for an election by the holder the effect of which is to make the payment of the principal of, or interest (or any other amount) on, a Global Note by the Company or a paying agent subject to United States federal income tax; or
(9)           any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8).
In addition, the Company shall not be required to pay additional amounts on any Global Note to a holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to additional amounts (or payment of additional amounts would not have been necessary) had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the holder of such Global Note.
For the purposes above:
"United States Alien" means any person who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, or a foreign partnership, one or more of the members of which is, for United States federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual or a non-resident alien fiduciary, of a foreign estate or trust.
"United States" or "U.S." means the United States of America (including the States and the District of Columbia) and its territories, its possessions and other areas subject to its jurisdiction.
Redemption for Tax Purposes:
The Company may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, the Global Notes on not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holder of record at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Global Notes being redeemed, together with interest accrued to the redemption date, if either of the following occurs:
(1)           as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in the official application (including a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States) or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the consummation of this offering, the Company becomes or will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described above under "Payment of Additional Amounts;" or
(2)           any act is taken by a taxing authority of the United States on or after the consummation of this offering, whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any affiliate, that results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay any additional amounts.
However, in order to redeem the Global Notes pursuant to this provision the Company will be required to determine, in the Company's business judgment, that the obligation to pay such additional amounts cannot be avoided by the use of commercially reasonable measures available to the Company, not including substitution of the obligor under the Global Notes or any action that would entail a material cost to the Company. The Company may not redeem unless it shall have received an opinion of counsel to the effect that because of an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States (as discussed above) such an act results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay additional amounts described above and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company are entitled to redeem the Global Notes pursuant to their terms.

Hewlett-Packard Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Five Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000) on March 15, 2008, and to pay interest thereon from March 13, 2003, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 in each year, commencing September 15, 2003, at the rate of 3.625% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day), next preceding such Interest Payment Date.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the

Interest on the Security shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and for any period shorter than a full six-month interest period, on the basis of the actual days elapsed in such period.
 
So long as all of the Securities of this series are represented by Global Securities, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on this Global Security shall be paid in same day funds to the Depositary, or to such name or entity as is requested by an authorized representative of the Depositary.  If at any time the Securities of this series are no longer represented by the Global Securities and are issued in definitive form ("Certificated Securities"), then the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on each Certificated Security at Maturity shall be paid to the Holder upon surrender of such Certificated Security at the office of agency maintained by the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (which shall initially be the principal corporate trust office of J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee) or at such other place or places as may be designated in or pursuant to the Indenture, provided that such Certificated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, acting as Paying Agent, in time for the Paying Agent to make such payments in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures.  Payments of interest with respect to Certificated Securities other than at Maturity may, at the option of the Company, be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it appears on the Security Register on the relevant Regular or Special Record Date or by wire transfer in same day funds to such account as may have been appropriately designated to the Paying Agent by such Person in writing not later than such relevant Regular or Special Record Date.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.

However, the Company's obligation to pay Additional Amounts will not apply to:

(6)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a failure to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation, identification or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of a Security if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the United States or an applicable tax treaty to which the United States is a party as precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

(9)           any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8).
 
In addition, the Company shall not be required to pay Additional Amounts on any Security to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a
 
beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts (or payment of Additional Amounts would not have been necessary) had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the Holder of such Security.
 
For the purposes above:
 
"United States Alien" means any Person who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, or a foreign partnership, one or more of the members of which is, for United States federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual or a non-resident alien fiduciary, of a foreign estate or trust.
"United States" or "U.S." means the United States of America (including the States and the District of Columbia) and its territories, its possessions and other areas subject to its jurisdiction.
At its option, the Company may redeem, as a whole, but not in part, the Securities on not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holder of record at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed, together with interest accrued to the Redemption Date, if either of the following occurs:
(1)
                                 
as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in the official application (including a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States) or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the consummation of this offering, the Company becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts;" or
(2)
                                 
any act is taken by a taxing authority of the United States on or after the consummation of the offering of the Securities, whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any Affiliate, which results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay any Additional Amounts.
 
However, in order to redeem the Securities pursuant to this provision the Company will be required to determine, in the Company's business judgment, that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of commercially reasonable measures available to the Company, not including substitution of the obligor under the Securities or any action that would entail a material cost to the Company. The Company may not redeem unless it shall have received an opinion of counsel to the effect that because of an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States (as discussed above) such an act results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay Additional Amounts described above and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company is entitled to redeem the Securities pursuant to their terms.
 
 
Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, no interest will accrue on the Securities called for redemption for the period from and after the Redemption Date.
 
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or Trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
 
 
principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
 
This Security shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of said State, without regard to conflict of laws principles thereof.
 
All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
