Eligibility:
 
    Participants will be eligible for the following severance payment in the event of a Qualifying Termination (as defined below):
Severance Benefit:
 
 For an Executive Officer who holds the title of Chief Executive Officer within 90 days before termination of HP employment, a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal, before taxes and other withholdings, to 2 times the sum of (i) his or her annual base salary as in effect immediately before termination of employment ("Base Salary") and (ii) average annualized cash bonus under the applicable short-term bonus plan for three years' worth of performance periods ending with the performance period most recently ended prior to termination of employment  ("Average Bonus");

 For Executive Officers who hold the title of Executive Vice President within 90 days before termination of HP employment, a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal, before taxes and other withholdings, to 1.5 times the sum of Base Salary and Average Bonus;
 - 
 
 For Executive Officers who hold the title of Senior Vice President or Vice President within 90 days before termination of HP employment, a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal, before taxes and other withholdings, to 1 times the sum of Base Salary and Average Bonus.
 - 
 
The severance payment under this plan shall be subject to applicable deductions and tax withholding and shall be payable within 10 days after execution of the release of claims described below.  Any payments under this plan shall be reduced by any cash severance benefit payable to the participant under any other HP plan, program or agreement, including cash amounts paid or payable for the uncompleted portion of employment agreements and prorated cash bonuses under the applicable short-term bonus plan.
 
    A participant will be deemed to have incurred a Qualifying Termination for purposes of this plan if he or she (1) is involuntarily terminated without Cause while holding Executive Officer status or within 90 days of having held Executive Officer status and (2) executes a full release of claims, in a form satisfactory to HP, within 45 days following termination of employment. Cause, for purposes, of this plan shall mean a participant's:
Qualifying Termination:
 
 Material neglect (other than as a result of illness or disability) of his or her duties or responsibilities to HP; or
 - 
 
 Conduct (including action or failure to act) that is not in the best interest of, or is injurious to, HP.
 - 
 
A participant shall not be deemed to have engaged in conduct constituting Cause under this plan except by a majority vote of the members of HP's Board of Directors or an independent committee thereof.
 
    All other compensation and benefits shall be governed by the applicable HP plan or agreement.  Payments under this plan shall not be considered compensation for purposes of any other compensation or benefit plan, program, or agreement of HP or its affiliates.  This plan is not intended to, and does not, create an employment relationship for any fixed term.
Effect on Other Benefits/At Will Status:
 
    This plan became effective on October 31, 2003 following approval by the HR and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of HP (the "Board") and may be amended, revised, revoked or terminated at the Board's or Committee's discretion. This plan is consistent with the Board's policy regarding severance agreements for senior executives, as adopted by resolutions dated July 18, 2003 (the "Resolutions"), and the benefits provided for hereunder, exclusive of "permitted benefits" (as defined in the Resolutions), do not exceed 2.99 times the sum of any eligible executive's base salary plus bonus as in effect immediately prior to separation from employment. The Committee may take such action as is necessary to implement and administer this plan consistent with the intent of the Board.

The modifier will be calculated as indicated on Appendix A with respect to the Restriction Period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the modifier will be equal to zero if the minimum threshold indicated on Appendix A is not met, resulting in no payout under this Agreement, and the modifier cannot exceed 2.
 
4.
      
Restrictions.
 
(a)  The Employee's Cash Award granted hereunder may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred until vested in accordance with paragraph 2.
 
(b)  Subject to paragraphs 6-9 of this Agreement, if the Employee's employment with the Company is terminated at any time prior to the expiration of the Restriction Period, this Agreement granted hereunder shall terminate and any interest in the Cash Award shall be forfeited by the Employee, and full ownership will be retained by the Company.
 
5.
      
Credits.
 
As milestones are achieved, the applicable portion of the Cash Award, as set forth in paragraph 3(b), shall be credited in the Employee's name.  Such credited amounts shall increase at a rate of 3.54%, compounded annually, which is the AFR for May 2005. The credited amounts and any additional amounts, shall be paid by the Company to the Employee, subject to the application of the modifier as set forth in paragraph 3(c); provided, however, that the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement are fulfilled.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a portion of the Cash Award shall be surrendered in payment of required withholding taxes in accordance with paragraph 10 below, unless the Company establishes alternative procedures for the payment of required withholding taxes.
 
The Company is under no obligation to transfer amounts credited to any trust or escrow account, and the Company is under no obligation to secure any amount credited by any specific assets of the Company or any other asset in which the Company has an interest.  This Plan shall not be construed to require the Company to fund any of the benefits provided hereunder nor to establish a trust for such purpose.  The Company may make such arrangements as it desires to provide for the payment of the Cash Award, including, but not limited to, the establishment of a rabbi trust or such other equivalent arrangements as the Company may decide.  No such arrangement shall cause the Plan to be a funded plan within the meaning of Title I of ERISA, nor shall any such arrangement change the nature of the obligation of the Company or the rights of the Employees under the Plan as provided in this Agreement.  Neither the Employee nor his or her estate shall have any rights against the Company with respect to any portion of the Cash Award except as a general unsecured creditor.  No Employee has an interest in his or her Cash Award until the Employee actually receives a payout.  The Employee's rights in the Cash Award shall be no greater than the rights of any other unsecured general creditor of the Company.  Credited amounts of the Cash Award hereunder shall for all purposes be part of the general funds of the Company.  Any payout to an Employee of amounts credited is not due, nor is such payout ascertainable, until determined by the Committee.
 
6.
      
Retirement of the Employee.
 
If the Employee retires after attaining 55 years of age with 15 years of service to the Company or 65 years of age or age under local law without regard to service, in accordance with the Company's retirement policy, the Employee
shall receive a pro rata amount of the Cash Award determined by multiplying the total Cash Award
 
due after such Cash Award is vested at the end of the Restriction Period by a fraction equal to the number of whole months elapsed between the Grant Date and the Employee's retirement, divided by the number of whole months between the Grant Date and the date the Cash Award would have vested in accordance with paragraph 2 above, payable at the end of such period
.  The Company's obligation to deliver the pro rata amount due under the Cash Award is subject to the condition that for the entire Restriction Period:
 
(a) The Employee shall render, as an independent contractor and not as an employee, such advisory or consultative services to the Company as shall reasonably be requested by the Company, consistent with the Employee's health and any other employment or other activities in which such Employee may be engaged;
 
(b) The Employee shall not render services for any organization or engage directly or indirectly in any business which, in the opinion of the Company, competes with or is in conflict with the interests of the Company;
 
(c) The Employee shall not, without prior written authorization from the Company, disclose to anyone outside the Company, or use in other than the Company's business, any confidential information or material relating to the business of the Company, either during or after employment with the Company; and
 
(d) The Employee shall disclose promptly and assign to the Company all right, title and interest in any invention or idea, patentable or not, made or conceived by the Employee during employment by the Company, relating in any manner to the actual or anticipated business, anything reasonably necessary to enable the Company to secure a patent where appropriate in the United States and in foreign countries.
 
7.
      
Total and Permanent Disability of the Employee.
 
In the event of total and permanent disability of the Employee, the
Employee shall receive a pro rata amount of the Cash Award determined by multiplying the total Cash Award due after such Cash Award is vested at the end of the Restriction Period by a fraction equal to the number of whole months elapsed between the Grant Date and the Employee's termination date due to the total and permanent disability, divided by the number of whole months between the Grant Date and the date the Cash Award would have vested in accordance with paragraph 2 above, payable at the end of such period.  A
ny unpaid but vested portion of the Cash Award shall be paid to the Employee if legally competent or to a legally designated guardian or representative if the Employee is legally incompetent.
 
8.
      
Death of the Employee.
 
In the event of the Employee's death prior to the end of the Restriction Period, the Employee's estate or designated beneficiary shall receive a pro rata amount of the Cash Award determined by multiplying the amount of the Cash Award due on the date vested
at the end of the Restriction Period
by a fraction equal to the number of whole months elapsed between the Grant Date and the Employee's death, divided by the number of whole months between the Grant Date and the date the Cash Award would have vested in accordance with paragraph 2 above
, payable at the end of such period
.  In the event of the Employee's death after the vesting dates but prior to the payment of cash, said cash shall be paid to the Employee's estate or designated beneficiary.
 
9.
      
Workforce Reduction.
 
In the event the Employee is placed in a workforce reduction program approved by the Board of Directors or its delegate(s), the
Employee shall receive a pro rata amount of the Cash Award determined by multiplying the total Cash Award due after such Cash Award is vested at the end of the Restriction Period by a fraction equal to the number of whole months elapsed between the Grant Date and the Employee's termination date due to workforce reduction, divided by the number of whole months between the Grant Date and the date the Cash Award would have vested in accordance with paragraph 2 above, payable at the end of such period.
 
10.
    
Taxes.
 
(a) The Employee shall be liable for any and all taxes, including withholding taxes, arising out of this grant of the Agreement or the vesting of the Cash Award hereunder. The Employee authorizes the Company, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries (as defined in the Plan), which are qualified to deduct tax at source, to deduct all applicable required withholding taxes and social security contributions from the Cash Award prior to remittance to the Employee, and, if necessary from the Employee's compensation.  The Employee agrees to pay any amounts that cannot be satisfied from wages or other cash compensation, to the extent permitted by law.
 
(b) The Company will assess its requirements regarding tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("tax-related items") withholding and reporting in connection with this grant or the vesting of the Cash Award hereunder.  These requirements may change from time to time as laws or interpretations change. Regardless of any action the Company or Employee's employer (the "Employer") takes with respect to any tax-related items, the Employee acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for any
and all tax-related items is and remains the Employee's responsibility and liability and that the Company (i) makes no representations nor undertakings regarding the treatment of any tax-related items in connection with any aspect of the Cash Award, including the grant or vesting; and (ii)  does not commit to structure the terms or the grant or any aspect of the Cash Award to reduce or eliminate the Employee's liability regarding tax-related items.
 
11.
