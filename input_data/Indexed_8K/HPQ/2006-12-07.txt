Item 8.01.  Other Events.
On December 7, 2006, Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") issued a press release announcing that it has entered into an agreement with the California Attorney General to resolve civil claims arising from the previously disclosed investigation into leaks from its board of directors.  As a result of this agreement, which includes an injunction, the California Attorney General will not pursue civil claims against HP or its current and former directors, officers and employees.  Under the terms of the agreement, HP will pay a total of $14.5 million and implement and maintain for five years a series of measures designed to ensure that HP's corporate investigations are conducted in accordance with California law and the company's high ethical standards.  Of the $14.5 million, $13.5 million will be used to create a Privacy and Piracy Fund to assist California prosecutors in investigating and prosecuting consumer privacy and information piracy violations, $650,000 will be used to pay statutory damages and $350,000 will reimburse the California Attorney General's office for its investigation costs.  There was no finding of liability against HP as part of the settlement.
The agreement does not affect the previously disclosed inquiries HP has received from the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Division of Enforcement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, nor does the agreement affect the previously disclosed stockholder derivative lawsuits filed in California and Delaware.
A copy of the press release announcing the agreement with the California Attorney General is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
