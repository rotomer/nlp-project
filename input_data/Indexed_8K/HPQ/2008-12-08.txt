the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally from time to time in effect, and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is
(C)
                              
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Securities have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally from time to time in effect, and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);

(D)
                             
 
this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(E)

(F)
                               
 
none of the issue and sale of the Securities, the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated or the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, the charter or by-laws of the Company or, to such counsel's knowledge, the terms of any Material Agreements, or any material decree or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company of any U.S. federal or California or Delaware court, governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction over the Company.

Such opinion shall also include a statement that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, counsel for the Company, the independent accountants of the Company and the Underwriters at which the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and related
matters were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus or the statements contained therein and has made no independent check or verification thereof, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that has caused such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (except the financial statements and the notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view) were not appropriately responsive in all material respects with requirements of the Act and the rules thereunder, (ii) the Registration Statement, as of the most recent Effective Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Prospectus as of its date and on the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case except for the financial statements and the notes thereto and the financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view) and (iii) that the Disclosure Package, considered together, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstance under which they were made, not misleading (except the financial statements and the notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, as to which such counsel need express no view).
 
Any of the statements described above may be omitted from the opinion of such counsel; provided, however, that in such event the Company shall also have furnished to the Representatives the corresponding opinion or statement of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, counsel for the Company, described in subsection 5(b)(ii) below.

In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California or the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company or public officials.
 
The Representatives shall have received from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, Disclosure Package and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

  (iii)
                       
 
  On the date of this Agreement and at the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters dated as of such date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm, with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder, stating or affirming in effect that:
  (e)
                          
 
in its opinion the Company's consolidated financial statements and schedule thereto audited by such independent registered public accounting firm accountants and included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2007, as incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Preliminary Prospectus and Final Prospectus, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission; with respect to the three-month periods ended January 31, 2008, April 30, 2008 and July 31, 2008, the six-month period ended April 30, 2008, and the nine-month period ended July 31, 2008 they have:
  (i)
                             
performed the procedures specified by the PCAOB for a review of interim financial information as described in AU 722, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements for these periods, included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended January 31, 2008, April 30, 2008 and July 31, 2008 incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; and
(1)
                                
 
inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
(2)
                                
 
As a result of the foregoing procedures nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
 
any material modifications should be made to the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;
(A)
                            
 
the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC; or
(B)
                              
 
the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2007, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
(C)
                              
 
they have read the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, board of directors and related committees or obtained a summary of topics discussed at such meetings for the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus;
(ii)
                                
 
they have performed certain other procedures as a result of which they determined that the information described in a schedule to be delivered to the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information that has been obtained from accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation)
(iii)
                             
set forth in the Registration Statement, as amended, the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement (including selected accounting, financial or statistical information included or therein), agrees with accounting records or schedules made from such accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation; and
 
they have:
(iv)

(A)
                            
 
inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to:
(B)
                              
 
(1)  the basis for their determination of the pro forma adjustments, and
 
(2)  whether such unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X; and
 
proved the arithmetic accuracy of the application of the pro forma adjustments to the historical amounts in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements.
(C)
                              
 
As a result of the foregoing procedures nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements referred to above incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X and that the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements.
 
References to the Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplements thereto at the date of the letter.
 
On the date of this Agreement and at the Closing Date, KPMG LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters dated as of such date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm, with respect to Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, stating or affirming in effect that:
(f)
                                  
in its opinion EDS' consolidated financial statements audited by such independent registered public accounting firm accountants and included in EDS' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, as incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Preliminary Prospectus and Final Prospectus, comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission; with respect to the three month period ended March 31, 2008 and the three and six month period ended June 30, 2008 they have:
(i)

(1)
                                
 
inquired of certain officials of EDS who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
(2)
                                
 
As a result of the foregoing procedures nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
 
any material modifications should be made to the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;
(A)
                                  
 
the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC; or
(B)
                                    
 
the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
(C)
                                    
 
Subsequent to the respective dates of which information is given in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement on or after the Execution Time), there shall not have been (i) any material change in the capital stock (other than upon exercise of outstanding stock options) or any significant increase in long-term debt of the Company or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) any material adverse change, or any development involving a
(g)
                               
prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering, sale or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
 
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives.  Notice of such termination shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.

Indemnification and Contribution
 
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates and selling agents and each person who controls any Underwriter, its affiliates and selling agents within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(h) hereof, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
(a)
                                
extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives for use in connection with the preparation thereof.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
 
Each Underwriter severally (and not jointly) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the third and sixth paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" of the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
(b)
                               
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under this Section 6 or otherwise.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to appoint counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent the indemnified party in such action; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to appoint counsel to defend such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 6, representing the indemnified parties under such
(c)
                                
paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity was sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action.
 
In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company or the Underwriters on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as
(d)
                               
the Company, subject in each case to clauses (y) and (z) of this paragraph (d).  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify in writing such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth on hereto, and not joint.
Schedule II
 
.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in hereto bears to the aggregate amount of such Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of all of the Securities set forth in hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 7, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Default by an Underwriter
Schedule II
Schedule II
 
.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on The New York Stock Exchange or trading of the Company's common stock on The New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by U.S. federal or New York State authorities, (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing any major disruption of settlements of securities clearance services in the United States or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to proceed with the offering, sale and delivery of the Securities.
8.
                                     
Termination
