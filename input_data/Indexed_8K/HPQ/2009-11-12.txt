Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On November 11, 2009, Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") issued a press release relating to its fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2009 entitled "
HP Announces Preliminary Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2009 Results; Raises Fiscal Year 2010 Earnings and Revenue Outlook.
" The text of this press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.  The information in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
To supplement HP's historical and forecasted financial results presented on a GAAP basis, HP provides non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is defined to exclude the effects of any restructuring charges, charges relating to the amortization of purchased intangible assets or acquisition-related charges recorded during the relevant period. In addition, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit associated with each non-GAAP item. HP's management uses non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting HP's financial performance. HP believes that providing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to investors in addition to the related GAAP measure provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by HP's management in its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see HP's results "through the eyes" of management. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may have limitations as an analytical tool, and this additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Item 9.01.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
