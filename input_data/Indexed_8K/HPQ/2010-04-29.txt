Other Events.
 
On April 28, 2010, Hewlett-Packard Company, a Delaware corporation ("HP"), filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Palm, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Palm"), and District Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HP ("Merger Sub").  HP is filing this amended Form 8-K to provide a summary of the Merger Agreement, to attach a copy of the Merger Agreement as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, and to incorporate the Merger Agreement herein by reference.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Palm (the "Merger") and each outstanding share of Palm common stock (other than shares as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised) will be converted into the right to receive $5.70 in cash, without interest.  The holders of shares of Palm Series B Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Palm Series C Preferred Stock, and the holders of outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Palm common stock will receive the respective consideration provided for under the terms of the Merger Agreement.
 
Palm and HP have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants that Palm will conduct its business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger, and, subject to certain customary exceptions, that the Board of Directors of Palm will recommend adoption by its stockholders of the Merger Agreement and will not solicit alternative business combination transactions.
 
The completion of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including certain approvals by Palm stockholders, the receipt of certain antitrust approvals, and other customary closing conditions.  Certain of Palm's significant stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of Palm capital stock in favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement.
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both HP and Palm and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Palm may be required to pay HP a termination fee of $33 million.
 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.  The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any other factual information about Palm or HP.  The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by Palm and HP. These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and (i) may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to Palm or HP if those statements prove to be inaccurate, (ii) have been qualified by disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, (iii) may apply materiality standards that are different from what may be viewed as material to investors, and (iv) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date(s) as may be specified in the Merger Agreement and are subject to more recent developments. Accordingly, these representations and warranties may not describe the actual state of affairs on the date they were made or at any other time.
