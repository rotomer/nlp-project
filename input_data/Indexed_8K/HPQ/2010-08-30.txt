On August 29, 2010, the Board of Directors of HP authorized an additional $10.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.  HP intends to use the additional authorization to repurchase its shares from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically.  During its third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2010, HP repurchased approximately $2.6 billion worth of its shares in open market repurchase transactions.  As of July 31, 2010, HP had approximately $4.9 billion of repurchase authorization remaining under the $8.0 billion repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in November 2009.
