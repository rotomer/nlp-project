On September 20, 2010, Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") announced that it had resolved litigation commenced on September 7, 2010 against Mark V. Hurd, HP's former Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, for alleged breach of contract and threatened misappropriation of trade secrets in connection with Mr. Hurd's employment with Oracle Corporation.  As part of that resolution, HP and Mr. Hurd agreed to modify the terms of the Separation Agreement and Release entered into between them on August 6, 2010 (the "Separation Agreement"), a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by HP with the Securities and Exchange Commission on that same date.  Under the terms of the modification, Mr. Hurd has agreed to waive his rights to the 330,177 performance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Hurd in January 17, 2008 referenced in paragraph 2.d. of the Separation Agreement and to the 15,853 time-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Hurd on December 11, 2009 referenced in paragraph 2.e. of the Separation Agreement, which collectively represent the only remaining compensation that Mr. Hurd was entitled to receive under the terms of the Separation Agreement.  The terms of the Separation Agreement have not otherwise been modified.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
