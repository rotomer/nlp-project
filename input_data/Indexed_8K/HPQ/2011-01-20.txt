Reiner, former Chief Information Officer of General Electric Company and current Special Advisor to private equity firm General Atlantic; Patricia F.

The five new directors will stand for re-election at HP's next annual meeting of stockholders, which is scheduled to be held on March 23, 2011 (the "Stockholder Meeting").  None of the new directors has been named to serve on any committee of the Board, and the information about whether any of the new directors is expected to be named to serve on any committees of the Board has not been determined or is unavailable at the time of this filing.
 
Each of the new directors will participate in the non-employee director compensation arrangements generally applicable to all HP non-employee directors. Under the terms of those arrangements as currently in effect, each new director will receive, among other things (i) an annual cash retainer of $100,000, which he or she may elect to receive in the form of HP securities, and an annual equity retainer of $175,000 paid at his or her election either in the form of restricted stock units or in equal amounts of restricted stock units and stock options, in each case prorated to reflect his or her service for a partial term; and (ii) $2,000 in cash for each Board meeting attended in excess of six per year. Each new director also will be eligible to participate in the product matching portion of the HP Employee Giving Program under which each non-employee director may contribute up to $100,000 worth of HP products each year to a qualified charity by paying 25% of the list price of those products, with HP contributing the remaining cost.
 
A copy of HP's press release announcing the election of the new directors is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
On January 20, 2011, the HP Board of Directors approved an amendment to Section 3.2 of Article III of HP's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") to increase the size of the Board from 12 to 17 directors effective on the Effective Date.
