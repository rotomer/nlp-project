News Release
 
 
 
 
In the second quarter, we saw continued strength in the enterprise with combined revenue from our commercial businesses up 8% year over year, said Cathie Lesjak, HP executive vice president and chief financial officer. We again expanded our margins and increased both earnings per share and cash flow from operations double digits year over year.
 
 
Trends and regional performance
Results were largely driven by performance in the commercial sector as businesses continued to spend on technology. HP experienced uneven consumer performance across its product categories during the quarter with continued softness in consumer PCs across all geographies.
 
Second quarter revenue was up 2% year over year in the Americas to $13.8 billion. Revenue was down 1% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and up 10% in Asia Pacific to $11.7 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. When adjusted for the effects of currency, revenue was up 1% in the Americas, flat in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and up 4% in Asia Pacific. Revenue from outside of the United States in the second quarter accounted for 66% of total HP revenue.  HP saw accelerated growth in BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) with revenue increasing 19% while accounting for 12% of total HP revenue.

Asset management
Inventory ended the quarter at $6.8 billion, with days of inventory up 1 day year over year at 26 days. Accounts receivable of $18.6 billion was up 10 days year over year at 53 days. Accounts payable ended the quarter at $14.2 billion, up 3 days from the prior-year period. HPs dividend payment in the second quarter resulted in cash usage of $182 million. HP also utilized $2.7 billion of cash during the quarter to repurchase approximately 64 million shares of common stock in the open market. HP exited the quarter with $12.8 billion in gross cash.
HP generated $4.0 billion in cash flow from operations in the second quarter.
 
 
Outlook
HPs revised outlook for the third quarter and the full year fiscal 2011 reflects an expected near-term impact from the Japan earthquake and related events, continued softness in sales of consumer PCs, and reduced operating profit expectations for Services.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, HP estimates revenue of approximately $31.1 billion to $31.3 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.90, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $1.08.
 
Third quarter fiscal 2011 non-GAAP diluted EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs of approximately $0.18 per share, related primarily to the amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges.
 
HP expects full year fiscal 2011 revenue in the range of $129 billion to $130 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of at least $4.27, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of at least $5.00.
 
Full year fiscal 2011 non-GAAP diluted EPS estimates exclude after-tax costs of approximately $0.73 per share, related primarily to the amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges.

Forward-looking statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, the results of HP may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including but not limited to any projections of revenue, margins, expenses, earnings, tax provisions, cash flows, benefit obligations, share repurchases, currency exchange rates, the impact of acquisitions or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations, including the execution of cost reduction programs and restructuring plans; any statements concerning the expected development, performance or market share relating to products or services; any statements regarding current or future macroeconomic trends or events and the impact of those trends and events on HP and its financial performance; any statements regarding pending investigations, claims or disputes; any statements of expectation

or belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Risks, uncertainties and assumptions include the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical trends and events; the competitive pressures faced by HPs businesses; the development and transition of new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and services to meet customer needs and respond to emerging technological trends; the execution and performance of contracts by HP and its suppliers, customers and partners; the protection of HPs intellectual property assets, including intellectual property licensed from third parties; integration and other risks associated with business combination and investment transactions; the hiring and retention of key employees; assumptions related to pension and other post-retirement costs; expectations and assumptions relating to the execution and timing of cost reduction programs and restructuring plans; the resolution of pending investigations, claims and disputes; and other risks that are described in HPs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010 and HPs other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including HPs Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2011. As in prior periods, the financial information set forth in this release, including tax-related items, reflects estimates based on information available at this time. While HP believes these estimates to be meaningful, these amounts could differ materially from actual reported amounts in HPs for the quarter ended April 30, 2011. In particular, determining HPs actual tax balances and provisions as of April 30, 2011requires extensive internal and external review of tax data (including consolidating and reviewing the tax provisions of numerous domestic and foreign entities), which is being completed in the ordinary course of preparing HPs Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
 
To supplement HPs consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, HP provides non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and gross cash. HP also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating margin is operating margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to gross cash is cash and cash equivalents. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are included in the tables above.
 
Use and Economic Substance of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used by HP
 
Non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP operating margin are defined to exclude the effects of any restructuring charges, charges relating to the amortization of purchased intangible assets, and acquisition-related charges recorded during the relevant period. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit associated with each non-GAAP item. HPs management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating HPs historical and prospective financial performance, as well as HPs performance relative to its competitors. HPs management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of HPs segment operating performance. HP believes that excluding those items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows HP management to better understand HPs consolidated financial performance in relationship to the operating results of HPs segments, as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, HPs management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
22/24
 
 
 
 
 
Gross cash is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and certain long-term investments that may be liquidated within 90 days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights. HPs management uses gross cash for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in HPs businesses, funding strategic acquisitions, repurchasing stock and other purposes. HPs management also uses gross cash for the purposes of evaluating HPs historical and prospective liquidity, as well as to further its own understanding of HPs segment operating results. Because gross cash includes liquid assets that are not included in GAAP cash and cash equivalents, HP believes that gross cash provides a more accurate and complete assessment of HPs liquidity and segment operating results.
 
Material Limitations Associated with Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of HPs results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are:
 
 
 
 
23/24
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compensation for Limitations Associated with Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
HP compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and gross cash by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. HP also provides robust and detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this press release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and HP encourages investors to review carefully those reconciliations.
 
Usefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors
 
HP believes that providing non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and gross cash to investors in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by HPs management in its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see HPs results through the eyes of management. HP further believes that providing this information better enables HPs investors to understand HPs operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of HPs operating performance with the performance of other companies in HPs industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated in a similar manner.
