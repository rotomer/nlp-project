Such opinion shall also include a statement that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, counsel for the Company, the independent accountants of the Company and the Underwriters at which the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus or the statements contained therein and has made no independent check or verification thereof, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that has caused such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (except the financial statements and the notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of
an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view) were not appropriately responsive in all material respects with requirements of the Act and the rules thereunder, (ii) the Registration Statement, as of the most recent Effective Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Prospectus as of its date and on the Closing Date includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case except for the financial statements and the notes thereto and the financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view) and (iii) that the Disclosure Package, considered together, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstance under which they were made, not misleading (except the financial statements and the notes thereto and financial statement schedules and other information of an accounting, statistical or financial nature included therein, as to which such counsel need express no view).
 
Any of the statements described above may be omitted from the opinion of such counsel; , , that in such event the Company shall also have furnished to the Representatives the corresponding opinion or statement of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, counsel for the Company, described in subsection 5(b)(ii) below.

In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California or the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company or public officials.
 
(c)
          
The Representatives shall have received from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, Disclosure Package and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate signed by an officer of the Company reasonably acceptable to the Representatives, dated the Closing Date, to the effect:
 
(i)
   
the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date, in each case, in all material respects, unless otherwise waived by the Representatives;
 
(ii)
  
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, or any notice that would prevent its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
 
(iii)
 
since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Disclosure Package, there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
 
(e)
          
On the date of this Agreement and at the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters dated as of such date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm, with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, stating or affirming in effect that:
 
(i)
   
in its opinion the Company's consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule thereto audited by such independent registered public accounting firm and included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K at October 31, 2010 and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Preliminary Prospectus and Final Prospectus, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission; with respect to the three-month period ended January 31, 2011 they have:
 
(1)
          
performed the procedures specified by the PCAOB for a review of interim financial information as described in AU 722, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements for the period, included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2011 incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; and
(2)
          
inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission.
 
As a result of the foregoing procedures nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
 
(A)
         
any material modifications should be made to the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;
 
(B)
          
the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission; or
 
(C)
          
the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to above were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2010, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
 
(ii)
  
they have:
 
(A)
         
read the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of the Company for February and March of both 2011 and 2010, such information being incomplete in that it omits certain disclosures; and
 
(B)
          
inquired of the Company's management who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements referred to in (A) are stated on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement
 
(iii)
 
they have read the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, board of directors, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee or obtained a summary of topics discussed at such meetings for the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement;
 
(iv)
 
they have performed certain other procedures as a result of which they determined that the information described in a letter to be delivered to the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information that has been obtained from accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or
which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation) set forth in the Registration Statement, as amended, the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement (including selected accounting, financial or statistical information included or therein), agrees with accounting records or schedules made from such accounting records which are subject to controls over financial reporting or which has been derived directly from such accounting records by analysis or computation.
 
(f)
           
Subsequent to the respective dates of which information is given in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement on or after the Execution Time), there shall not have been (i) any material change in the capital stock (other than upon exercise of outstanding stock options) or any significant increase in long-term debt of the Company or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering, sale or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
 
(g)
          
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
 
(h)
          
Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the Securities by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. ("Moody's") or Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P") and neither Moody's nor S&P shall have publicly announced that it has placed any of the Securities on a credit watch with negative implications, except as disclosed prior to the Execution Time.
 
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives.  Notice of such termination shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.

Indemnification and Contribution
.
 
(a)
          
The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates and selling agents and each person who controls any Underwriter, its affiliates and selling agents within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to
which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(h) hereof, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives for use in connection with the preparation thereof.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter severally (and not jointly) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the third and sixth paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" of the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under this Section 6 or otherwise.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to appoint counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent the indemnified party in such action; , , if the defendants in any such action include both the

indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to appoint counsel to defend such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 6, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is a party and indemnity was sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action.
 
(d)
          
In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company or the Underwriters on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clauses (y) and (z) of this paragraph (d).  Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify in writing such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth on hereto, and not joint.

Default by an Underwriter
.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters of that series of Securities shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in hereto for that particular series of Securities bears to the aggregate amount of such Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of all of the Securities set forth in hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 7, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto.

The Floating Rate Global Notes will bear interest for each interest period at a rate determined by the calculation agent.  The calculation agent is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A, until such time as HP appoints a successor calculation agent.  The interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes for a particular interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR as determined on the interest determination date plus 0.280%.  The interest determination date for an interest period will be the second London business day preceding the first day of such interest period.  Promptly upon determination, the calculation agent will inform the Trustee and HP of the interest rate for the next interest period.  Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the calculation agent shall be binding and conclusive on the holders of the Floating Rate Global Notes, the Trustee and HP.  A London business day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
 
Interest on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be paid to but excluding the relevant Interest Payment Date.  Interest payments on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be made quarterly in arrears on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year, commencing August 24, 2011 to the person in whose name the Floating Rate Global Notes are registered at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date.  Interest on the Floating Rate Global Notes will accrue from and including May 31, 2011, to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be.  Each of these periods is referred to as an "interest period."  The amount of accrued interest that HP will pay for any interest period shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of the Floating Rate Global Notes then outstanding by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from May 31, 2011, or from the latest date interest was paid to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that date by 360.  If an Interest Payment Date for the Floating Rate Global Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such next succeeding Business Day would be in the following month, in which case, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
On any interest determination date, LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date.  If on an interest determination date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the calculation agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM."
 
If no offered rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM" on an interest determination date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the calculation agent (after consultation with HP) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the calculation agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time.  If three quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current interest period.
 
Upon request from any holder of Floating Rate Global Notes, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate in effect for the Floating Rate Global Notes for the current interest period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next interest period.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation of the interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).  Each calculation of the interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes by the calculation agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Holders and HP.
 
The interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum permitted rate by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
 
 
The Floating Rate Global Notes will bear interest for each interest period at a rate determined by the calculation agent.  The calculation agent is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A, until such time as HP appoints a successor calculation agent.  The interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes for a particular interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR as determined on the interest determination date plus 0.400%.  The interest determination date for an interest period will be the second London business day preceding the first day of such interest period.  Promptly upon determination, the calculation agent will inform the Trustee and HP of the interest rate for the next interest period.  Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the calculation agent shall be binding and conclusive on the holders of the Floating Rate Global Notes, the Trustee and HP.  A London business day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
 
Interest on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be paid to but excluding the relevant Interest Payment Date.  Interest payments on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be made quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 30, August 30 and November 30 of each year, commencing August 30, 2011 to the person in whose name the Floating Rate Global Notes are registered at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date.  Interest on the Floating Rate Global Notes will accrue from and including May 31, 2011, to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be.  Each of these periods is referred to as an "interest period."  The amount of accrued interest that HP will pay for any interest period shall be calculated
by multiplying the face amount of the Floating Rate Global Notes then outstanding by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from May 31, 2011, or from the latest date interest was paid to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that date by 360.  If an Interest Payment Date for the Floating Rate Global Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such next succeeding Business Day would be in the following month, in which case, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
On any interest determination date, LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date.  If on an interest determination date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the calculation agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM."
 
If no offered rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM" on an interest determination date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the calculation agent (after consultation with HP) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the calculation agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time.  If three quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current interest period.
 
Upon request from any holder of Floating Rate Global Notes, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate in effect for the Floating Rate Global Notes for the current interest period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next interest period.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation of the interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be rounded to the
nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).  Each calculation of the interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes by the calculation agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Holders and HP.
 
The interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum permitted rate by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
 
 
The Company will have the right to redeem the 1.550% Global Notes, in whole or in part on at least 30 days' but no more than 60 days' prior written notice mailed to the registered holders of the 1.550% Global Notes to be redeemed.  The redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 1.550% Global Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present value of the principal amount of the 1.550% Global Notes to be redeemed and the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon from the redemption date to the maturity date discounted from the scheduled payment dates to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate plus 10 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the 1.550% Global Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the 1.550% Global Notes (or such portion thereof) called for redemption and such 1.550% Global Notes will cease to be outstanding.  If any redemption date is not a business day, the Company will pay the redemption price on the next business day without any interest or other payment due to the delay.
 
If fewer than all of the 1.550% Global Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the 1.550% Global Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems appropriate and fair.  No 1.550% Global Notes of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part.
 
 
The Company will have the right to redeem the 2.650% Global Notes, in whole or in part on at least 30 days' but no more than 60 days' prior written notice mailed to the registered holders of the 2.650% Global Notes to be redeemed.  The redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2.650% Global Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present value of the principal amount of the 2.650% Global Notes to be redeemed and the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon from the redemption date to the maturity date discounted from the scheduled payment dates to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the 2.650% Global Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the 2.650% Global Notes (or such portion thereof) called for redemption and such 2.650% Global Notes will cease to be outstanding.  If any redemption date is not a business day, the Company will pay the redemption price on the next business day without any interest or other payment due to the delay.
 
If fewer than all of the 2.650% Global Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the 2.650% Global Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems appropriate and fair.  No 2.650% Global Notes of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part.
 
 
The Company will have the right to redeem the 4.300% Global Notes, in whole or in part on at least 30 days' but no more than 60 days' prior written notice mailed to the registered holders of the 4.300% Global Notes to be redeemed.  The redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 4.300% Global Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present value of the principal amount of the 4.300% Global Notes to be redeemed and the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon from the redemption date to the maturity date discounted from the scheduled payment dates to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the 4.300% Global Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the 4.300% Global Notes (or such portion thereof) called for redemption and such 4.300% Global Notes will cease to be outstanding.  If any redemption date is not a business day, the Company will pay the redemption price on the next business day without any interest or other payment due to the delay.
 
If fewer than all of the 4.300% Global Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the 4.300% Global Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems appropriate and fair.  No 4.300% Global Notes of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part.

Hewlett-Packard Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of                          Dollars ($                        ) or such other amount indicated on the Schedule of Exchange of Global Notes attached hereto on May 24, 2013 (if such date is not a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest for the Securities will be paid on the next Business Day; provided, however, that no interest on that payment will accrue from and after May 24, 2013), and to pay interest thereon from May 31, 2011 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing August 24, 2011 as described on the reverse of this Security, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated
herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Dated:
 
THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON TRUST COMPANY, N.A., as Trustee
 
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2000 (herein called the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor to Chase Manhattan Bank and Trust Company, National Association), as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $1,750,000,000.
 
This Security will bear interest for each interest period at a rate determined by the calculation agent, which shall initially be The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. until such time as the Company appoints a successor calculation agent (herein called the "Calculation Agent," which term includes any successor Calculation Agent under the Indenture).  The interest rate on the Securities for a particular Interest Period (as defined below) will be a per annum rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR (as defined below) as determined on the Interest Determination Date plus 0.280% (the "Interest Rate").  The "Interest Determination Date" for an Interest Period will be the second London Business Day preceding the first day of such Interest Period.  Promptly upon determination, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee and the Company of the Interest Rate for the next Interest Period.  Absent manifest error, the determination of the Interest Rate by the Calculation Agent shall be binding and conclusive on the holders of this Security, the Trustee and the Company.  A London Business Day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
 
Interest on the Securities will be paid to but excluding the relevant Interest Payment Date.  Interest payments on the Securities will be made quarterly in arrears on the Interest Payment Date, beginning on August 24, 2011, to the person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date.  Interest on this Security will accrue from and including May 31, 2011, to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be (each of these periods is referred to as an "Interest Period").  The amount of accrued interest that the Company will pay for any Interest Period shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent by multiplying the face amount of the Securities then outstanding by an Accrued Interest Factor.  This Accrued Interest Factor is computed by adding the Interest Factor calculated for each day from May 31, 2011, or from the latest date interest was paid to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The "Interest Factor" for each day is computed by dividing the Interest Rate applicable to that date by 360.  If an Interest Payment Date for the Securities falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such next succeeding Business Day would be in the
 
following month, in which case, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
On any Interest Determination Date, "LIBOR" will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.  If on an Interest Determination Date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM."  If no offered rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM" on an Interest Determination Date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the calculation agent (after consultation with the Company) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the Calculation Agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time.  If three quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next Interest Period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current Interest Period.
 
Upon request from any holder of Securities, the Calculation Agent will provide the Interest Rate in effect for the Securities for the current Interest Period and, if it has been determined, the Interest Rate to be in effect for the next Interest Period.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation of the Interest Rate on the Securities will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Securities will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).  Each calculation of the Interest Rate on the Securities by the Calculation Agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Holders and the Company.
 
The Interest Rate on the Securities will in no event be higher than the maximum permitted rate by New York law as the same may be modified by Unites States law of general application.
 
The Securities may not be redeemed by the Company prior to Maturity.
 
The Indenture contains provisions, which will apply to the Securities, for defeasance and covenant defeasance and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration or transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or Trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
This Security shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of said State, without regard to conflict of laws principles thereof.
 
All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF.  THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR A SECURITY REGISTERED, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART MAY BE REGISTERED, IN THE NAME OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN SUCH DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF, EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE.
 
UNLESS THIS SECURITY IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION ("DTC") TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OR TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY SECURITY ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO.

Hewlett-Packard Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of                          Dollars ($                        ) or such other amount indicated on the Schedule of Exchange of Global Notes attached hereto on May 30, 2014 (if such date is not a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest for the Securities will be paid on the next Business Day; provided, however, that no interest on that payment will accrue from and after May 30, 2014), and to pay interest thereon from May 31, 2011 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly on February 28, May 30, August 30 and November 30 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing August 30, 2011 as described on the reverse of this Security, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON TRUST COMPANY, N.A., as Trustee
 
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2000 (herein called the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor to Chase Manhattan Bank and Trust Company, National Association), as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000.
 
This Security will bear interest for each interest period at a rate determined by the calculation agent, which shall initially be The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. until such time as the Company appoints a successor calculation agent (herein called the "Calculation Agent," which term includes any successor Calculation Agent under the Indenture).  The interest rate on the Securities for a particular Interest Period (as defined below) will be a per annum rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR (as defined below) as determined on the Interest Determination Date plus 0.400% (the "Interest Rate").  The "Interest Determination Date" for an Interest Period will be the second London Business Day preceding the first day of such Interest Period.  Promptly upon determination, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee and the Company of the Interest Rate for the next Interest Period.  Absent manifest error, the determination of the Interest Rate by the Calculation Agent shall be binding and conclusive on the holders of this Security, the Trustee and the Company.  A London Business Day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
 
Interest on the Securities will be paid to but excluding the relevant Interest Payment Date.  Interest payments on the Securities will be made quarterly in arrears on the Interest Payment Date, beginning on August 30, 2011, to the person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date.  Interest on this Security will accrue from and including May 31, 2011, to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be (each of these periods is referred to as an "Interest Period").  The amount of accrued interest that the Company will pay for any Interest Period shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent by multiplying the face amount of the Securities then outstanding by an Accrued Interest Factor.  This Accrued Interest Factor is computed by adding the Interest Factor calculated for each day from May 31, 2011, or from the latest date interest was paid to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The "Interest Factor" for each day is computed by dividing the Interest Rate applicable to that date by 360.  If an Interest Payment Date for the Securities falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such next succeeding Business Day would be in the
 
following month, in which case, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
On any Interest Determination Date, "LIBOR" will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.  If on an Interest Determination Date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM."  If no offered rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM" on an Interest Determination Date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the calculation agent (after consultation with the Company) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the Calculation Agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time.  If three quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next Interest Period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current Interest Period.
 
Upon request from any holder of Securities, the Calculation Agent will provide the Interest Rate in effect for the Securities for the current Interest Period and, if it has been determined, the Interest Rate to be in effect for the next Interest Period.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation of the Interest Rate on the Securities will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Securities will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).  Each calculation of the Interest Rate on the Securities by the Calculation Agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Holders and the Company.
 
The Interest Rate on the Securities will in no event be higher than the maximum permitted rate by New York law as the same may be modified by Unites States law of general application.
 
The Securities may not be redeemed by the Company prior to Maturity.
 
The Indenture contains provisions, which will apply to the Securities, for defeasance and covenant defeasance and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration or transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or Trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
This Security shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of said State, without regard to conflict of laws principles thereof.
 
All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000.
 
The Company will have the right to redeem the Securities, in whole or in part on at least 30 days' but no more than 60 days' prior written notice mailed to the registered Holders of the Securities to be redeemed.  The Redemption Price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (2) the sum, as determined by the Company based on the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, of the present value of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon from the Redemption Date to the Maturity Date (the "Remaining Life") (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted from the scheduled payment dates to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at the treasury rate plus 10 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
 
If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent on or before the Redemption Date and the conditions set forth in Article 11 of the Indenture are satisfied, then on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on such Securities (or such portion thereof) called for redemption and such Securities will cease to be outstanding.  If any Redemption Date is not a Business Day, the Company will pay the Redemption Price on the next Business Day without any interest or other payment due to the delay.
 
If fewer than all of the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Securities of such series for redemption on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems appropriate and fair.  No Securities of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part.
 
Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, no interest will accrue on the Securities called for redemption for the period from and after the Redemption Date.

"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States (a Primary Treasury Dealer), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by each Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the redemption date; provided that if three such quotations cannot reasonably be obtained by the Company, but if two such quotations are obtained, then the average of the two quotations shall be used, and if only one such quotation can reasonably be obtained by the Company, then one quotation shall be used.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for the redemption date.

The Company will have the right to redeem the Securities, in whole or in part on at least 30 days' but no more than 60 days' prior written notice mailed to the registered Holders of the Securities to be redeemed.  The Redemption Price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (2) the sum, as determined by the Company based on the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, of the present value of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon from the Redemption Date to the Maturity Date (the "Remaining Life") (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted from the scheduled payment dates to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at the treasury rate plus 15 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
 
If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent on or before the Redemption Date and the conditions set forth in Article 11 of the Indenture are satisfied, then on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on such Securities (or such portion thereof) called for redemption and such Securities will cease to be outstanding.  If any Redemption Date is not a Business Day, the Company will pay the Redemption Price on the next Business Day without any interest or other payment due to the delay.
 
If fewer than all of the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Securities of such series for redemption on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems appropriate and fair.  No Securities of $1,000 or less will be redeemed in part.
 
Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, no interest will accrue on the Securities called for redemption for the period from and after the Redemption Date.
 
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for the redemption date.

THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR A SECURITY REGISTERED, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART MAY BE REGISTERED, IN THE NAME OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN SUCH DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF, EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE.
 
UNLESS THIS SECURITY IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION ("DTC") TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OR TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY SECURITY ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC) ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL, INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
 
 
Hewlett-Packard Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of                          Dollars ($                        ) or such other amount indicated on the Schedule of Exchange of Global Notes attached hereto on June 1, 2021 (if such date is not a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest for the Securities will be paid on the next Business Day); provided, however, that no interest on that payment will accrue from and after June 1, 2021, and to pay interest thereon from May 31, 2011, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 in each year, commencing December 1, 2011, at the rate of 4.300% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.

Interest on the Security shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and for any period shorter than a full six-month interest period, on the basis of the actual days elapsed in such period.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the
 
Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration or transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

The titles of such series of Securities shall be the "Floating Rate Global Notes due May 24, 2013" (the ""), the "Floating Rate Global Notes due May 30, 2014" (the "", together with the 2013 Floating Rate Global Notes, the ""), the "1.550% Global Notes due May 30, 2014" (the ""), the "2.650% Global Notes due June 1, 2016" (the "") and the "4.300% Global Notes due June 1, 2021" (the "", together with the 2014 Global Notes and the 2016 Global Notes, the "", and the Fixed Rate Global Notes and the Floating Rate Global Notes, collectively, the "") (copies of which are attached hereto as , , , , and , respectively).

2.             The aggregate principal amount of the Global Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture shall be $1,750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Floating Rate Global Notes, $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Floating Rate Global Notes, $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Global Notes, $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Global Notes and $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Global Notes (except for Global Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Global Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 and 1107 of the Indenture, and except for any Global Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered thereunder).
 
3.             The prices at which the Global Notes shall be issued to the public are: 100% for the 2013 Floating Rate Global Notes; 100% for the 2014 Floating Rate Global Notes; 99.971% for the 2014 Global Notes; 99.958% for the 2016 Global Notes; and 99.799% for the 2021 Global Notes.
 
 
4.             Interest on the Global Notes shall be payable to the Persons in whose names the Global Notes (or one or more Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
5.             The Stated Maturity of the 2013 Floating Rate Global Notes on which the principal thereof is due and payable is May 24, 2013 (if such date is not a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest for the Securities will be paid on the next Business Day; provided, however, that no interest on that payment will accrue from and after May 24, 2013).  The Stated Maturity of the 2014 Floating Rate Global Notes on which the principal thereof is due and payable is May 30, 2014 (if such date is not a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest for the Securities will be paid on the next Business Day; provided, however, that no interest on that payment will accrue from and after May 30, 2014).  The Stated Maturity of the 2014 Global Notes on which the principal thereof is due and payable is May 30, 2014 (if such date is not a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest for the Securities will be paid on the next Business Day; provided, however, that no interest on that payment will accrue from and after May 30, 2014).  The Stated Maturity of the 2016 Global Notes on which the principal thereof is due and payable is June 1, 2016 (if such date is not a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest for the Securities will be paid on the next Business Day; provided, however, that no interest on that payment will accrue from and after June 1, 2016).  The Stated Maturity of the 2021 Global Notes on which the principal thereof is due and payable is June 1, 2021 (if such date is not a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest for the Securities will be paid on the next Business Day; provided, however, that no interest on that payment will accrue from and after June 1, 2021).
 
6.             The Floating Rate Global Notes will bear interest for each interest period at a rate determined by the calculation agent.  The calculation agent is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. until such time as the Company appoints a successor calculation agent.  The interest rate on the 2013 Floating Rate Global Notes for a particular interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR as determined on the interest determination date plus 0.280%.  The interest rate on the 2013 Floating Rate Global Notes for a particular interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR as determined on the interest determination date plus 0.400%.  The interest determination date for an interest period will be the second London business day preceding the first day of such interest period.  Promptly upon determination, the calculation agent will inform the Trustee and the Company of the interest rate for the next interest period.  Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the calculation agent shall be binding and conclusive on the holders of the Floating Rate Global Notes, the Trustee and the Company.  A London business day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
 
Interest on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be paid to but excluding the relevant Interest Payment Date.  Interest payments on the 2013 Floating Rate Global Notes will be made quarterly in arrears on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year, beginning on August 24, 2011, to the person in whose name the 2013 Floating Rate Global Notes are registered at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date.  Interest payments
 
on the 2014 Floating Rate Global Notes will be made quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 30, August 30 and November 30 of each year, beginning on August 30, 2011, to the person in whose name the 2014 Floating Rate Global Notes are registered at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date.  Interest on the Floating Rate Global Notes will accrue from and including May 31, 2011, to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or date of Maturity, as the case may be.  Each of these periods is referred to as an "interest period."  The amount of accrued interest that the Company will pay for any interest period shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of the Floating Rate Global Notes then outstanding by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from May 31, 2011, or from the latest date interest was paid to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that date by 360.  If an Interest Payment Date for the Floating Rate Global Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such next succeeding Business Day would be in the following month, in which case, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
On any interest determination date, LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date.  If on an interest determination date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR 01" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the calculation agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM."
 
If no offered rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM" on an interest determination date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the calculation agent (after consultation with the Company) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time.  If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the calculation agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time.  If three quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current interest period.

All percentages resulting from any calculation of the interest rate on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Floating Rate Global Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
