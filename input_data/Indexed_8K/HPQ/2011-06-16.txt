At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such nominations for director will be made and only such other business will be conducted as will have been properly brought before the meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting, nominations and other business must be:  (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in these Bylaws, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2.

timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of HP not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; , , that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after the anniversary date of the previous years annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (x) the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the annual meeting and (y) the tenth (10th) day following the date on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.

In no event will the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a stockholders meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

1934 Act

 five (5) business days after the record date for the annual meeting of any such agreement, arrangement or understanding in effect as of the record date for the meeting, and (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholders notice by, or on behalf of, the stockholder or beneficial owner, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class of shares of HP, or increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to shares of HP, and the stockholders agreement to notify HP in writing within five (5) business days after the record date for such meeting of any such agreement, arrangement or understanding in effect as of the record date for the meeting.
 
Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business will be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2.  The chairman of the annual meeting may determine and declare, if the facts warrant, at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2, and, if he or she should so determine, he or she will so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting will not be transacted.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder does not provide the information required under clauses (ii)(B) and (iii)(A) through (iii)(C) of this Section 2.2(d) to HP within five (5) business days following the record date for an annual meeting of stockholders or if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting to present the business described in the stockholders notice delivered pursuant to this Section 2.2(d), such business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by HP.  For purposes of this Section 2.2, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder (or a reliable reproduction or electronic transmission of the writing) delivered to HP prior to the proposing of the business at the meeting by the stockholder stating that the person is authorized to act for the stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for an annual meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act, and the foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.2 will not apply to stockholders who have notified HP of their intention to present a stockholder proposal only pursuant to and in compliance with such regulations.
 
(e)
 
   
Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (e) and the following paragraph (f) will be eligible for election as directors.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of HP may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders, or at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the notice for such meeting, by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by any stockholder of record of HP at the time of giving notice provided for in these Bylaws, who is entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2.

if any, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director will furnish to the secretary of HP that information required to be set forth in the stockholders notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee and such other information as HP may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as a director of HP.  No person will be eligible for election as a director of HP unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (f).
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder does not provide the information required under clauses (ii)(B) and (iii)(A) through (iii)(C) of this Section 2.2(f) to HP within five (5) business days following the record date for an annual or special meeting of stockholders or if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting to present the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by HP.
 
(g)
 
   
The chairman of the meeting may determine and declare, if the facts warrant, at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and in such event the defective nomination will be disregarded.

A request to the secretary shall be signed by each stockholder, or a duly authorized agent of such stockholder, requesting the special meeting and shall set forth a brief description of each matter of business desired to be brought before the special meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the special meeting and the information required in paragraph (d) or (f) of Section 2.2 of these Bylaws, as applicable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a special meeting requested by stockholders shall not be held if the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual meeting of stockholders to be held within ninety (90) days after the secretary receives the request for the special meeting and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the business of such annual meeting includes (among any other matters properly brought before the annual meeting) the business specified in the request.  A stockholder may revoke a request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the secretary, and if, following such revocation, there are un-revoked requests from stockholders holding in the aggregate less than the requisite number of shares

In the event a special meeting is called for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the notice for such meeting, if the stockholders notice required by paragraph (f) of Section 2.2 shall be delivered to the secretary of HP at the principal executive offices of HP not earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the special meeting nor later than the close of business on the later of:  (i) the sixtieth (60th) day prior to the special meeting or (ii) the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.  In no event shall the public announcement (as defined in paragraph (c) of Section 2.2 above) of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.
 
(d)
 
   
Only such business will be considered at a special meeting of stockholders as will have been stated in the notice for such meeting.
 
2.4
   
Organization
.  Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or in his or her absence by a person designated by the Board of Directors, or, in the absence of a person so designated by the Board of Directors, by the chief executive officer, or in his or her absence by the chief financial officer, or in his or her absence by the secretary, if any, or in his or her absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting by the vote of a majority in interest of the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereat.  The secretary, or in his or her absence, an assistant secretary, or, in the absence of the secretary and all assistant secretaries, a person whom the chairman of the meeting will appoint will act as secretary of the meeting and keep a record of the proceedings thereof.
 
The Board of Directors of HP will be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it will deem necessary, appropriate or convenient.  Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the chairman of the meeting will have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on participation in such meeting to stockholders of record of HP and their duly authorized and constituted proxies, and such other persons as the chairman will permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for balloting and matters which are to be voted on by ballot.

6
 
 
meeting, meetings of stockholders will not be required to be held in accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.
 
2.5
   
Notice of Stockholders Meetings
.  All notices of meetings of stockholders will be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.6 of these Bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.  The notice will specify the place (if any), date, and hour of the meeting and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the Board of Directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any matter properly may be presented at the meeting for such action).  The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected will include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the Board of Directors intends to present for election.  Any previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be postponed, and, except for meetings of stockholders called by the Board of Directors pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section 2.3 of these Bylaws (which meetings may be cancelled only on the terms provided in paragraph (b) of Section 2.3 of these Bylaws) or if the Certificate of Incorporation otherwise provides, any meeting of the stockholders may be cancelled, by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.
 
2.6
   
Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice
.  Notice of any meeting of stockholders will be given either personally, by mail, express mail, courier service or, with the actual or constructive consent of the stockholder entitled to receive such notice, by facsimile, electronic mail or other means of electronic transmission.  If sent by mail, express mail or courier service, such notice will be sent postage or charges prepaid and will be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of HP or given by the stockholder to HP for the purpose of notice, and such notice will be deemed to have been given.  Notice given by electronic transmission pursuant to this subsection will be deemed given:  (a) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a facsimile telecommunication number at which the stockholder has actually or constructively consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has actually or constructively consented to receive notice; (c) if by posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
 
An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent or mailing agent of HP giving the notice, will be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice or report.
 
2.7
   
Quorum
.  The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or the Certificate of Incorporation.  If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or
 
 
7
 
 
(ii) the stockholders by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, will have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time in accordance with Section 2.8, each without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
 
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy will decide any matter properly brought before such meeting, unless (i) the matter is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a vote of a different number or voting by classes is required, in which case such express provision will govern and control the decision of the matter, or (ii) the matter is brought pursuant to the rules of an exchange upon which the securities of HP are listed, in which case such rules will determine the vote required.
 
If a quorum be initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
 
2.8
   
Adjourned Meeting; Notice
.  Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned for any reason from time to time by either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock represented at the meeting, either in person or by proxy.  In the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at that meeting except as provided in Section 2.7 of these Bylaws.
 
When any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  However, if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed or if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting, then notice of the adjourned meeting will be given.  Notice of any such adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of these Bylaws.  At any adjourned meeting HP may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
 
2.9
   
Voting
.  The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these Bylaws.
 
Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, by these Bylaws or as required by law, each stockholder will be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock registered in such stockholders name on the books of HP on the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting.
 
 
8
 
 
 
            Any stockholder entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of such stockholders shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting part or all of such stockholders remaining shares or, except when the matter is the election of directors and plurality voting applies, may vote part or all of them against the proposal; but if the stockholder fails to specify the number of shares which the stockholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the stockholders vote is with respect to all shares which the stockholder is entitled to vote.
 
2.10
   
Validation of Meetings; Waiver of Notice; Consent
.  The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, will be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy.
 
Attendance by a person at a meeting also will constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
 
2.11
   
Action by Written Consent
.  Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series of Preferred Stock or any other class of stock or series thereof having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of HP must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of HP and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.
 
2.12
   
Record Date for Stockholder Notice; Voting; Giving Consents
.  For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the Board of Directors may fix, a record date, which will not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and will not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of HP after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, by these Bylaws, by agreement or by applicable law.
 
If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders will be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
 
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders will apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the Board of Directors will fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting.
 
The record date for any other purpose will be as provided in Section 8.1 of these Bylaws.
 
 
9
 
 
 
2.13
   
Proxies
.  Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy, which may be in the form of a facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, signed by the person and submitted to the secretary of HP or HPs proxy solicitor, but no such proxy will be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  A proxy will be deemed signed if the stockholders name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, facsimile signature or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholders attorney-in-fact or, in the case of an electronically transmitted proxy, the submission has been properly authorized.  A duly executed proxy will be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.  A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by submitting another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the secretary.
 
A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, written notice of such death or incapacity is received by HP.
 
2.14
   
Inspectors of Election
.  Before any meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors will appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment.  The number of inspectors will be either one (1) or three (3).  If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholders proxy will, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
 
Such inspectors will:
 
(a)
   
determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the validity of proxies;
 
(b)
   
receive votes and ballots;
 
(c)

It will be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to HP) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for HP to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense will be on HP.  Neither the failure of HP (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by HP (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
If a determination is made pursuant to this Section 6.1 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, HP will be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section 6.1.  HP will be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to the third paragraph of this Section 6.1 that the procedures and presumptions of this Article VI are not valid, binding and enforceable and will stipulate in such proceeding that HP is bound by all the provisions of this Article VI.  The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Section 6.1 will not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise.  No repeal or modification of this Article VI will in any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any director, officer, employee or agent of HP hereunder in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.
 
6.2
   
Indemnification of Others
.  HP will have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (other than present and former directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred or suffered in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of HP.  For purposes of this Section 6.2, an employee or agent of HP (other than a director or officer) includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of HP, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of HP as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who
 
 
21
 
 
was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of HP or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.  To obtain indemnification under this Section 6.2, a claimant will submit to the secretary of HP a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant will be granted indemnification.
 
6.3
   
Insurance
.  HP may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of HP, or is or was serving at the request of HP as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not HP would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
6.4
   
Expenses
.  HP will advance to any person eligible for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, and may advance to any person eligible for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, all expenses reasonably incurred by any such person in connection with defending such proceeding, upon receipt of a request therefor and an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise, such advances to be paid by HP within twenty (20) days after the receipt by HP of a statement or statements from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, HP will not be required to advance expenses in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by any person unless the proceeding was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors of HP.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to Section 6.5, HP will not advance or continue to advance expenses to any person (except by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director of HP in which event this paragraph will not apply) in any proceeding if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum (ii) if there are no Disinterested Directors or the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion or (iii) by a majority vote of a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of HP.
 
6.5
   
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
.  The rights conferred on any person by this Article VI will not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.  HP is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

6.6
   
Survival of Rights
.  The rights conferred on any person by this Article VI will continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or other agent and will inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
6.7
   
Amendments
.  Any repeal or modification of this Article VI will only be prospective and will not affect the rights under this Article VI in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of HP.
 
6.8
   
Severability
.  If any provision or provisions of this Article VI will be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:  (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) will be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
 
6.9
   
Notice
.  Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be given to HP under this Article VI will be in writing and either delivered in person or sent by confirmed telecopy, electronic mail, overnight mail or courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage or charges prepaid, return copy requested, to the secretary of HP and will be effective only upon receipt by the secretary.

Maintenance and Inspection of Records

HP will, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the Board of Directors or the secretary, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these Bylaws as amended to date, accounting books and other records.
 
Any stockholder of record or beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, in person or by attorney or other agent, will, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose HPs stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom.  In every instance where the stockholder is other than a record holder of stock in HP, the demand under oath will state the persons status as a stockholder, be accompanied by documentary evidence of beneficial ownership of the stock and state that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be.  A proper purpose will mean a purpose reasonably related to such persons interest as a stockholder.  In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath will be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder.  The demand under oath will be directed to HP at its registered office in Delaware or to the secretary of HP at HPs principal place of business.

The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought.  The Court may summarily order HP to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom.  The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
