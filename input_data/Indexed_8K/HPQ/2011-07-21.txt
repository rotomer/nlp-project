On July 21, 2011, the Board of Directors of Hewlett-Packard (HP) authorized an additional $10.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock.  HP intends to use the additional authorization to repurchase its shares from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically.  As of April 30, 2011, HP had approximately $5.9 billion of repurchase authorization remaining under the $10.0 billion repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in August 2010.
