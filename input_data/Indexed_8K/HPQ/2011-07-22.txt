This Current Report on Form 8-K/A (the Amendment) updates information disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 28, 2011 (the Original Form 8-K) relating to the Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on March 23, 2011 (the Annual Meeting). The sole purpose of this Amendment is to disclose HPs decision regarding how frequently it will conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation.
 
Item 5.07                      Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
As previously reported in the Original Form 8-K, at the Annual Meeting, an advisory vote was conducted on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation.  A majority of the shares were voted for holding such advisory votes on an annual basis.  HP has considered the outcome of this advisory vote and has determined, as was recommended with respect to this proposal by HPs board of directors in the proxy statement for the Annual Meeting, that HP will hold an annual advisory vote on executive compensation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
