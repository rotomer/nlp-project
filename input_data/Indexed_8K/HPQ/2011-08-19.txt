Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Offer Agreement
 
On August 18, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") and Hewlett-Packard Vision B.V. ("HP Vision"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HP, entered into an Offer Agreement with Autonomy Corporation plc ("Autonomy").  Pursuant to the Offer Agreement, HP announced pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers the terms of a recommended cash offer (the "Offer") under which HP, acting through HP Vision, would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Autonomy for 25.50 ($42.11) per share in cash.
 
HP intends to effect the Offer by means of a takeover offer within the meaning of Part 28 of the United Kingdom Companies Act (the "Companies Act").  However, HP has the right to elect to complete the acquisition of Autonomy by way of scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act on the same terms (subject to appropriate amendment).
 
The Offer Agreement contains various terms and conditions relating to the Offer including, among other matters, the recommendation of the Offer to Autonomy shareholders by the members of Autonomy's Board of Directors, the payment of an inducement fee by Autonomy to HP under certain circumstances, limited non-solicitation and exclusivity restrictions, the right of HP to match any superior proposal, required actions related to regulatory filings and clearances, and extensions of the acceptance period.
 
The Offer is subject to customary conditions including, (i) acceptance of the Offer by the holders of at least 75% of the Autonomy share capital, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, that the members of Autonomy's Board of Directors will continue to recommend the Offer, (iii) expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iv) clearance of other required regulatory approvals, and (v) other customary conditions.
 
HP intends to fund the Offer with a combination of HP's existing cash resources and debt financing.  The acquisition of Autonomy is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2011.
 
The foregoing description of the Offer Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Offer Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto.  The information in Exhibit 2.1 is filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and therefore may be incorporated by reference into filings made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
 
Entry into Bridge Facility
 
On August 18, 2011, HP entered into a new 5,000,000,000 364-Day unsecured bridge term loan agreement (the "Bridge Facility"), together with the lenders named therein and Barclays Bank plc ("Barclays"), as administrative agent.   The Bridge Facility may be used for cash consideration to fund the acquisition of Autonomy,  including paying amounts required by the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers and amounts used to refinance indebtedness to fund such acquisition.
 
Borrowings under the Bridge Facility may be made in Sterling or in Dollars, at the option of HP.  Interest on borrowings in Sterling is payable at rates per annum equal to a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin and for borrowings in Dollars at a fluctuating base rate equal to Barclays' adjusted base rate plus the applicable margin, or a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin. HP is required to pay a commitment fee based on the unused portion of the commitments under the Bridge Facility. The applicable margin and the commitment fee are determined by reference to a pricing schedule based on HP's senior unsecured debt ratings.  Additionally, HP is required to pay a duration fee with respect to borrowings outstanding on certain dates following the offer to acquire Autonomy being declared unconditional or deemed to be unconditional.
Under the Bridge Facility, HP may not permit the ratio of its consolidated EBITDA to its consolidated interest expense for any four consecutive fiscal quarters prior to maturity to exceed 3.00 to 1.00.
 
The Bridge Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative and financial covenants, which were made only for the purposes of the Bridge Facility and as of the specific date (or dates) set forth therein, and may be subject to certain limitations as agreed upon by the contracting parties.  The Bridge Facility provides, however, during a period defined as the "Certain Funds Period", that only specified representations and warranties are applicable to ensure compliance with the Certain Funds provisions of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.  The covenants limit, among other things, HP and its subsidiaries from granting certain liens supporting indebtedness, entering into sale and leaseback transactions and selling or disposing of assets and HP and its significant subsidiaries from entering into fundamental change transactions.  In addition, the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Bridge Facility may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors.  Investors are not third-party beneficiaries of the Bridge Facility and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants contained therein, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of HP.
 
The Bridge Facility Agreement includes customary events of default, including events of default relating to non-payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made or when deemed made, violation of covenants, cross payment-defaults, cross acceleration, bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain unsatisfied judgments and a change of control.  If an event of default occurs under the Bridge Facility, the lenders will be able to terminate the commitments and accelerate the maturity of the loans under the Bridge Facility and exercise other rights and remedies.  The Bridge Facility provides, however, that during the Certain Funds Period, only specified events of default shall apply, and further provides for a clean-up period to permit cure of any technical breaches.

Notice to US Investors
 
The Offer is being made for securities of a United Kingdom company and Autonomy Shareholders in the United States should be aware that this announcement, the Offer Document and any other documents relating to the Offer have been or will be prepared in accordance with the City Code and United Kingdom disclosure requirements, format and style, all of which differ from those in the United States.  Autonomy's financial statements and all financial information that is included in this announcement, or that may be included in the Offer Document or any other documents relating to the Offer, have been or will be prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards and may not be comparable to financial statements of United States companies.
 
The Offer, which is open to Autonomy Shareholders in the United States, will be subject to a limited extent to US tender offer rules and securities laws (Regulation 14E), and will otherwise be made in accordance with the requirements of the City Code, the Panel, the London Stock Exchange and the Financial Services Authority.  Accordingly, the Offer will be subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement procedures and timing of payments that are different from those generally applicable under United States domestic tender offer
procedures and law.  In the United States, the Offer will be deemed made solely by HP Vision and not by any of its financial advisers.
 
Autonomy is a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.  The directors of Autonomy are residents of countries other than the United States.  As a result, it may not be possible for Autonomy Shareholders in the United States to effect service of process within the United States upon Autonomy or its officers or directors or to enforce against any of them judgements of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.  It may not be possible to sue Autonomy or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of the United States securities laws.  There is also substantial doubt as to enforceability in the United Kingdom in original actions, or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of United States courts, based on the civil liability provisions of United States federal securities laws.
 
In accordance with the City Code and normal United Kingdom market practice and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b)(12) under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""), HP Vision or its nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, Autonomy Shares outside the United States, otherwise than pursuant to the Offer, before or during the period in which the Offer remains open for acceptance, such as in open market purchases at prevailing prices or privately negotiated purchases at negotiated prices.  In the event that HP Vision or its nominees or brokers (acting as agents) purchase or make arrangements to purchase Autonomy Shares for a consideration greater than the Offer Price, the Offer Price will be increased to match the higher price paid outside the Offer.  Such purchases, or arrangements to purchase, will comply with all applicable United Kingdom rules, including the City Code and the rules of the London Stock Exchange.  In addition, in accordance with the City Code, normal United Kingdom market practice and Rule 14e-5(b)(12) under the Exchange Act, Barclays Capital will continue to act as an exempt principal trader in Autonomy securities on the London Stock Exchange.  These purchases may occur in the open market or as privately negotiated transactions.
Exchange Act
 
Information regarding such purchases and activities which is required to be made public in the United Kingdom pursuant to the City Code will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available to all investors (including US investors) on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com.

Background to and Reasons for the Offer
 
The acquisition of Autonomy will significantly expand HP's offerings in the market for enterprise information software. Autonomy's leading IDOL platform combined with HP's strength in complementary products, services and infrastructure will enable the combined business to deliver a next-generation information platform, analytical applications and performance optimisation solutions.
 
The majority of enterprise information today is text, voice and video but existing information and analytical solutions have focused primarily on structured information from transactional applications.  HP believes that with Autonomy, it can re-invent the Enterprise Information platform to include structured and unstructured data and increase the efficiency, effectiveness and automation of enterprise business processes while dramatically improving the user experience of today's workforce.
 
The acquisition of Autonomy is consistent with HP's stated strategy of expanding its software portfolio capabilities and HP expects the acquisition to deliver benefits to Autonomy and the combined customer base and to the enlarged group:
 
New Solutions, Products and Services
 
                 
New Industry & LOB Solutions (Healthcare, Financial Services, Retail, IT, Legal, Customer Service, Sales);
 
                 
New unified analytic and optimisation platform and applications;
 
                 
IT Performance Suite Software  Storage Archiving & Back-Up solutions and Help Desk solutions;
 
                 
Digitisation & Printing  Intelligent Document Processing solutions;
 
                 
Services  Information and Document Processing practices;
 
                 
Mobile offerings leveraging tablets, phones, PCs, printers, servers, storage; and
 
                 
Cloud data management expertise from its 31 Petabyte cloud offering.
 
These new solutions, products and services can advance HP's route to markets via one of the largest enterprise sales and services organisations in the world.
 
Strategic and Financial Benefits
 
                 
Positions HP as leader in large and growing space:
  Autonomy has a strong position in the $20 billion Enterprise Information Management space, which is growing at 8 per cent annually and is uniquely positioned to continue growth within this space.  Furthermore, key Autonomy assets would provide HP with the ability to reinvent the $55 billion Business Analytics software and services space, which is growing at 8 per cent annually.
                 
Complements HP's existing technology portfolio and enterprise strategy:
  Autonomy offers solutions that are synergistic across HP's enterprise offerings and strengthens capabilities for data analytics, the cloud, industry capabilities and workflow management. This will bolster HP's cloud offerings with key assets for information management and data analytics.  Autonomy also complements existing HP offerings from ESSN, software, services and IPG.
 
                 
Provides differentiated IP for services and extensive vertical capabilities in key industries:
  Acquiring Autonomy would provide differentiated IP for services, including extensive vertical capabilities in key industries such as government, financial services, legal, pharmaceutical and healthcare.
 
                 
Provides IPG a base for content management platforms:
  Autonomy provides HP with a content management platform and accelerates a major component of the IPG enterprise strategy to continue its growth of document and content management and higher value commercial printing opportunities.
 
                 
Enhances HP's financial profile:
  Autonomy's strong growth and profit margin profile complements HP's efforts to improve its business mix by focusing on enterprise software and solutions.  Autonomy has a consistent track record of double-digit revenue growth, with 87 per cent gross margins and 43 per cent operating margins in calendar year 2010.(2)
 
                 
Accretive to HP's Earnings:
(3)  HP expects the acquisition to be accretive to Non-GAAP earnings per share for HP shareholders in the first full year following completion.
 
6.
                                     
Background to and Reasons for the Recommendation
 
Since its founding in 1996, the vision of Autonomy has been to become one of the leading enterprise infrastructure software businesses on a global basis and create excellence in its proprietary technology offering, employment opportunities and financial performance.  Today, Autonomy through its industry leading IDOL platform is leading the movement towards delivery of cloud based software solutions.  Over the last five years, Autonomy has grown its revenues at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 55 per cent and adjusted operating profit at a rate of approximately 83 per cent.  Autonomy's recent operating and financial performance has been strong, including its most recent results for the quarter ending 30 June 2011.
 
Accordingly, in recommending the Offer, the Autonomy Directors have given careful consideration to the fundamental and future value of the business and to the reasonable expectations of Autonomy Shareholders.  In particular, the Autonomy Directors considered that the Offer represents an opportunity for Autonomy Shareholders to receive cash at:
 
(2)
                                 
These are derived from Autonomy non-IFRS reported figures which exclude the effect of certain specific, non-recurring and non-cash charges.
(3)
                                 
This statement regarding earnings enhancement is not intended to be a profit forecast and should not be interpreted to mean that the earnings per HP share, or of the combined group, for the current or future financial periods will necessarily be greater than those for the relevant preceding financial period.
                                         
a premium of approximately 64 per cent to the Closing Price of 15.58 per Autonomy Share on 17 August 2011 (being the Closing Price on the Business Day prior to the commencement of the Offer Period);
 
                                         
a premium of approximately 53 per cent to the average Closing Price of 16.62 per Autonomy Share over the six month period to 17 August 2011, being the last Business Day prior to the commencement of the Offer Period; and
 
                                         
a premium of approximately 36 per cent over the highest Closing Price over the fifty-two week high price of an Autonomy Share of 18.81.
 
In addition, becoming part of HP provides a unique opportunity to drive increased penetration and cross-selling of Autonomy's solutions on a global scale through the additional resources and assets available to the enlarged group.  The Autonomy Directors believe that becoming part of a larger organisation will also extend the opportunities available to Autonomy employees.
 
The Autonomy Directors believe that the Offer by HP provides both an attractive value to Autonomy Shareholders and allows for the accelerated development of the Autonomy business with an exceptional combined offering.

Matching right
 
If the Autonomy Directors determine that a Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, Autonomy has agreed to notify HP Vision and provide the material details which led to such conclusion and notify HP Vision of the date of any meeting of the Board of Autonomy convened to consider whether or not to recommend the Superior Proposal and until which time Autonomy has agreed (subject to compliance with the Autonomy Directors fiduciary and legal duties and applicable laws, rules and regulations) not to recommend any Superior Proposal or withdraw any Scheme setting out Offer proposals from HP Vision.  If within two Business Days of receipt of the notice of the Superior Proposal, HP Vision fails to confirm that it intends to increase its offer to a price or financial value equal to or greater than that provided under the Superior Proposal; or, having provided the above confirmation, HP Vision fails within two Business Days of such confirmation to announce its revised offer, then the Autonomy Directors shall be entitled to withdraw, qualify or modify their recommendation of the Offer.  Otherwise, Autonomy has agreed to procure that the Autonomy Directors recommend the revised offer of HP Vision (subject to compliance with their fiduciary and legal duties and applicable laws, rules and regulations).
 
                 
Conditions and regulatory filings
 
HP Vision has agreed to use all reasonable endeavours to procure the satisfaction of certain regulatory conditions as set out in paragraphs b. and c. of Appendix I as soon as practicable following the date of this announcement.  Autonomy has agreed that it will work co-operatively with HP Vision to prepare all regulatory filings required to obtain the clearances, consents, permissions and waivers necessary or reasonably considered appropriate by HP Vision.
 
                 
Switch to a Scheme
 
If HP Vision determines that it wishes to implement the acquisition of Autonomy by way of a Scheme, it has agreed do so on substantially the same terms and conditions as set out in this announcement and Autonomy has agreed to undertake or cause to be taken all reasonable steps to promptly implement a Scheme and to consult with and keep HP Vision informed of all dealings with the Panel and the Court in connection with the Scheme.
 
                 
Acceptance period
 
HP Vision has agreed with Autonomy that until such time as the Offer becomes or is declared unconditional as to acceptances, it will extend the Offer for such further period as may be agreed between HP Vision and Autonomy (or in the absence of an agreement by the time the extension would need to be announced, by the lesser of seven days and the period remaining until the sixtieth day after the day upon which the Offer Document is published), provided always that HP Vision will not be obliged to extend the period during which the Offer may become or be declared unconditional as to acceptances beyond midnight on the sixtieth day after the day on which the initial Offer Document in respect of the Offer is published.

Structure of the Offer
 
The Offer is to be effected by means of a takeover offer within the meaning of Part 28 of the Companies Act.  HP reserves the right to elect to implement the acquisition of Autonomy, with the consent of the Panel, by way of scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act which will be implemented on the same terms (subject to appropriate amendment) as the Offer.  In the event of such an election by HP, Autonomy has agreed to do all things reasonably necessary and to take all such steps promptly to implement a Scheme and the Autonomy Directors with holdings of Autonomy Shares have agreed to vote in favour of the shareholder resolutions required in connection with the Scheme.  Further details of these undertakings are set out in the Offer Agreement referred to in section 14 and in Appendix III.
 
References to the Offer and the Offer Document in this announcement shall include, where applicable, such scheme of arrangement.
 
The Offer will be subject to the conditions and further terms set out or referred to in Appendix I and in the Offer Document.
 
16.
                              
Expected Timetable
 
It is intended that the Offer Document containing further details of the Offer will be despatched to Autonomy Shareholders as soon as practicable (and, in any event, not later than 28 days after the date of this announcement).
 
17.
                              
Compulsory Acquisition, De-listing and Re-registration
 
If the Offer becomes or is declared wholly unconditional, and sufficient acceptances under the Offer are received, HP Vision intends to procure that Autonomy will make an application for the cancellation of the listing of Autonomy Shares on the Official List and for the cancellation of trading of Autonomy Shares on the London Stock Exchange's market for listed securities.  In addition, Autonomy Shareholders should note that Autonomy may cease to be eligible for listing if less than 25 per cent of Autonomy Shares are in public hands, which for these purposes would exclude interests in more than 5 per cent.  In this event, HP Vision intends to request the FSA to cancel Autonomy's listing on the basis that Autonomy no longer satisfies all the continuing obligations for maintaining a listing.
 
De-listing is likely to significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability of any Autonomy Shares in respect of which the Offer has not been accepted.
 
If the Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects it is anticipated that cancellation of listing on the Official List and cancellation of trading on the London Stock Exchange will take effect no earlier than 20 Business Days after the earliest of: (i) the date on which HP Vision has obtained, at a general meeting, the prior approval of a resolution for the cancellation from a majority of not less than 75 per cent of the holders of Autonomy Shares as (being entitled to do so) vote in person or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy (the ""); (ii) the date on which HP Vision has, by virtue of its shareholdings and acceptances of the Offer, acquired or agreed to acquire 75 per cent of the voting rights attaching to the Autonomy Shares; or (iii) the first date of issue of compulsory acquisition notices under Part 28 of the Companies Act.
De-listing Resolution
 
It should be noted that cancellation of listing on the Official List and cancellation of trading on the London Stock Exchange may occur earlier in the event that, as a consequence of less than 25 per cent of Autonomy Shares being in public hands, the FSA determines that Autonomy is no longer eligible for listing.  HP Vision will notify Autonomy Shareholders when the De-listing Resolution has been passed (or the compulsory acquisition notices served) and confirm that the notice period has commenced and the anticipated date of cancellation.
 
If HP Vision receives acceptances of the Offer in respect of, and/or otherwise acquires, 90 per cent or more of the Autonomy Shares to which the Offer relates and 90 per cent or more of the voting rights attaching to such shares and assuming all other conditions of the Offer have been satisfied or waived (if they are capable of being waived), HP Vision intends to exercise its rights pursuant to Sections 974 to 991 of the Companies Act to acquire compulsorily, on the same terms as the Offer, the remaining Autonomy Shares in respect of which the Offer has not been accepted.
 
It is also intended that, following the Offer becoming or being declared unconditional in all respects, Autonomy will seek to re-register as a private company under the relevant provisions of the Companies Act.

Notice to US Investors
 
The Offer is being made for securities of a United Kingdom company and Autonomy Shareholders in the United States should be aware that this announcement, the Offer Document and any other documents relating to the Offer have been or will be prepared in accordance with the City Code and United Kingdom disclosure requirements, format and style, all of which differ from those in the United States.  Autonomy's financial statements and all financial information that is included in this announcement or that may be included in the Offer Document or any other documents relating to the Offer, have been or will be prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards and may not be comparable to financial statements of United States companies.
 
The Offer, which is open to Autonomy Shareholders in the United States, will be subject to a limited extent to US tender offer rules and securities laws (Regulation 14E), and will otherwise be made in accordance with the requirements of the City Code, the Panel, the London Stock Exchange and the Financial Services Authority.  Accordingly, the Offer will be subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement procedures and timing of payments that are different from those generally applicable under United States domestic tender offer procedures and law.  In the United States, the Offer will be deemed made solely by HP Vision and not by any of its financial advisers.
 
Autonomy is a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.  The directors of Autonomy are residents of countries other than the United States.  As a result, it may not be possible for Autonomy Shareholders in the United States to effect service of process within the United States upon Autonomy or its officers or directors or to enforce against any of them judgements of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.  It may not be possible to sue Autonomy or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of the United States securities laws.  There is also
substantial doubt as to enforceability in the United Kingdom in original actions, or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of United States courts, based on the civil liability provisions of United States federal securities laws.
 
In accordance with the City Code and normal United Kingdom market practice and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b)(12) under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""), HP Vision or its nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, Autonomy Shares outside the United States, otherwise than pursuant to the Offer, before or during the period in which the Offer remains open for acceptance, such as in open market purchases at prevailing prices or privately negotiated purchases at negotiated prices.  In the event that HP Vision or its nominees or brokers (acting as agents) purchase or make arrangements to purchase Autonomy Shares for a consideration greater than the Offer Price, the Offer Price will be increased to match the higher price paid outside the Offer.  Such purchases, or arrangements to purchase, will comply with all applicable United Kingdom rules, including the City Code and the rules of the London Stock Exchange.  In addition, in accordance with the City Code, normal United Kingdom market practice and Rule 14e-5(b)(12) of the Exchange Act, Barclays Capital will continue to act as an exempt principal trader in Autonomy securities on the London Stock Exchange.  These purchases may occur in the open market or as privately negotiated transactions.
Exchange Act
 
Information regarding such purchases and activities which is required to be made public in the United Kingdom pursuant to the City Code will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available to all investors (including US investors) on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
This announcement, oral statements made regarding the Offer and other information published by HP, HP Vision or Autonomy, including information included or incorporated by reference to this announcement, may contain statements that are, or may be, "forward-looking statements".  These statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Autonomy, HP and HP Vision (as the case may be) and are naturally subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.  The forward-looking statements contained herein may include statements about the expected effects on Autonomy or HP of the Offer, the expected timing and scope of the Offer, strategic options and all other statements in this document other than historical or current facts.  Without limitation, any statements preceded or followed by or that include the words "targets", "plans", "believes", "expects", "aims", "intends", "will", "may", "should", "could", "would", "can", "continue", "opportunity", "anticipates", "estimates", "projects", or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.  Many of these risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond the companies' abilities to control or estimate precisely, such as: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and
management strategies and the expansion and growth of Autonomy's or HP's operations and potential synergies resulting from the Offer; and (iii) the effects of government regulation on Autonomy's or HP's business.  There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  These factors include, but are not limited to, the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer, failure to consummate the proposed acquisition, failure to realise the benefits of the proposed acquisition, significant transaction costs and/or unknown liabilities and general economic and business conditions that affect the companies following the proposed acquisition as well as additional factors, such as changes in economic conditions, changes in the level of capital investment, success of business and operating initiatives and restructuring objectives, changes in consumer habits and preferences, competitive product and pricing pressures, customers' strategies and stability, changes in the regulatory environment, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, the outcome of litigation, government actions and natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes.  Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the present and future business strategies of the companies and the environment in which each will operate in the future.  Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.  All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to HP, HP Vision or Autonomy or any of their respective members, directors, officers or employees or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above.  All forward-looking statements included in this announcement are based on information available to HP, HP Vision and Autonomy on the date of this announcement and are made only as of the date of this announcement.  Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements.  None of Autonomy, HP or HP Vision assumes any obligation nor does any of them intend, to update publicly or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent legally required.
 
Dealing and Opening Position Disclosure Requirements
 
Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested (directly or indirectly)  in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any paper offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any paper offeror is first identified.
 
An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any paper offeror(s).  An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th Business Day following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th Business Day following the announcement in which any paper offeror is first identified.
 
Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a paper offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.
 
Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested (directly or indirectly) in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any paper offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any paper offeror.  A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any paper offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8.  A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the Business Day following the date of the relevant dealing.
 
If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a paper offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.
 
Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).
 
Details of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Takeover Panel's website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified.  If you are in any doubt as to whether you are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure, you should contact the Panel's Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129.
 
Note: References to "Rules" are to the rules of the City Code.  The terms "offeror", "offeree company", "offer period", "interested" (and related variations),"relevant securities", "deals" (and related variations) and "acting in concert" all bear the same meanings given to them in the City Code.
