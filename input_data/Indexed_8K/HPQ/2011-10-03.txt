On August 18, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") and Hewlett-Packard Vision B.V. ("HP Vision"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HP, entered into an Offer Agreement (the "Offer Agreement") with Autonomy Corporation plc ("Autonomy").  Pursuant to the Offer Agreement, HP announced pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers the terms of a recommended cash offer (the "Offer") under which HP, acting through HP Vision, would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Autonomy for 25.50 per share in cash.
 
On October 3, 2011, HP announced that HP Vision had received valid acceptances of the Offer in respect of a total of 213,421,299 Autonomy shares, representing approximately 87.34 percent of the existing issued share capital of Autonomy, which acceptances include those received with respect to 22,190,066 Autonomy shares (representing approximately 9.09 percent of the existing issued share capital of Autonomy) pursuant to irrevocable commitments procured by HP Vision from certain members of the Board of Directors of Autonomy who held Autonomy shares.  HP also announced that all conditions relating to the Offer had been satisfied or waived, and the Offer was unconditional in all respects.  In addition, HP announced that the Offer will remain open until further notice, and at least 14 days' notice will be given of the closing of the Offer.
 
Settlement of the Offer will, in the case of acceptances received on or before October 3, 2011, occur on or before October 17, 2011.  With respect to acceptances received after October 3, 2011 but while the Offer remains open for acceptance, settlement will occur within 14 days of receipt.
 
HP intends to fund the settlement of the Offer with a combination of HP's existing cash resources and debt financing.
 
Following completion of the Offer, HP Vision intends to exercise its rights pursuant to Sections 974 to 991 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006 to acquire compulsorily, on the same terms as the Offer, the remaining Autonomy shares with respect to which the Offer has not been accepted.
