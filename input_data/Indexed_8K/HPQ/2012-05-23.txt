 This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
   
 
If such risks or uncertainties materialize or such assumptions prove incorrect, the results of HP and its consolidated subsidiaries could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including but not limited to any forecasts or projections of the extent or timing of cost savings, charges, use of cost savings, revenue or profitability improvements, or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations, including the timing and execution of cost reduction programs, restructuring plans, retirement programs and the number of employees impacted by such plans and programs; any statements concerning HP's expected competitive position or performance; any statements regarding anticipated operational and financial results; any statements of expectation or belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.  Risks, uncertainties and assumptions include the timing and execution of cost reduction programs, restructuring plans and retirement programs; employee management issues and negotiations with works councils and employee representatives; estimates and assumptions related to the cost of exiting employees and pension and other post-retirement costs; the competitive pressures faced by HPs businesses; the development and transition of new products and services (and the enhancement of existing products and services) to meet customer needs and respond to emerging technological trends; and other risks that are described in HPs Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2012 and HPs other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including HPs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2011.
