ITEM: Changes in registrant's certifying accountant
Date of Report (date of earliest event reported): May 12, 2003
Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
(a) Previous Independent Accountants
On May 12, 2003, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") informed the sponsor of the H&R Block Retirement Savings Plan (the "Plan") that it has declined to stand for re-election as the independent accountants for the Plan upon completion of the audit of the Plan's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and services related thereto.
The reports of PwC on the financial statements for the past two fiscal years contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
In connection with its audits for the two most recent fiscal years and through May 12, 2003, the date of this Form 8-K, there have been no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC would have caused them to make reference thereto in their report on the financial statements for such years.
During the two most recent fiscal years and through May 12, 2003, the date of this Form 8-K, there have been no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v)). The Plan has requested that PwC furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of such letter dated May 16, 2003, is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
(b)     New Independent Accountants.
In accordance with the Audit Committee Charter, H&R Block, Inc.'s Audit Committee will select the Plan's independent public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003.
Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(c)     Exhibits. The following exhibit is filed with this report:
Exhibit 16.1  Letter from PwC to the Securities and Exchange Commission dated May 16, 2003.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: May 16, 2003
Exhibit 16.1 Letter from PwC to the Securities and Exchange Commission dated May 16, 2003.

May 16. 2003
Securities and Exchange Commission 450 Fifth Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20549
Commissioners:
We have read the statements made by H&R Block Retirement Savings Plan (the "Plan") (copy attached), which we understand will be filed with the Commission, pursuant to Item 4 of Form 8-K, as part of the Company's Form 8-K report dated May 12, 2003. We agree with the statements concerning our Firm in such Form 8-K.
Very truly yours,
