H&R BLOCK REPORTS RECORD 6 CENTS PER SHARE SECOND QUARTER PROFIT
Fiscal Year Earnings Guidance Increased
FOR RELEASE NOVEMBER 25, 2003, 4 P.M. EST
     KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block Inc. (NYSE:HRB) today reported net income of $10.4 million, or 6 cents per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter ended Oct. 31. Last year, the company reported a second quarter loss of $37.3 million, or 21 cents per share.
     Second quarter revenues increased to $579.9 million, up 23 percent from $471.4 million last year.
     The company has never previously reported a profitable second quarter. H&R Block typically reports losses in its first and second quarters due to the seasonal nature of its tax service businesses. Earlier this year, the company's first quarter was profitable for only the second time in company history.
     "Achieving profitability in the second quarter highlights the continued strength of H&R Block's mix of businesses, combined with very solid execution across all of our business segments. We're now preparing intently for tax season 2004 and looking forward to demonstrating how our services offer clients unique and compelling value," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark A. Ernst.
     "Our second quarter results were achieved through continued strong performance in our mortgage businesses, solid management and cost controls within our tax businesses, improved results in our business and investment services segments, and a good tax season in Australia," Ernst said.
     The prior year second quarter included a $41.7 million charge (14-cents per share) related to the settlement of litigation involving refund anticipation loans and a $6 million (3-cents per share) goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these charges, the company achieved a 10-cent improvement in earnings per share compared to last year.

     "The strength of this improvement is further evident when you consider that this year's second quarter also includes $12.8 million in costs related to starting company-owned operations in former major franchise territories, as well as $4.1 million in stock-based compensation expense," Ernst said.
     For the six months ended Oct. 31, H&R Block reported an improvement of 35 cents in earnings per share, compared with last year. The company reported net income of $15.5 million, or 9 cents per basic and diluted share, for the first six months of its fiscal year, compared with a loss of $46.9 million last year, or 26 cents per share. Revenues for the six-month period increased 20.2 percent to $1.1 billion, up from $902.8 million last year.
Change in Accounting
     In the second quarter the company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-21 (EITF 00-21) and recorded a $6.4 million charge, net of $4 million in taxes, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, related to its Peace of Mind guarantee program in Premium tax offices. The three months ended July 31, 2003, have been restated to reflect the adoption of EITF 00-21 as of May 1, 2003, including the $6.4 million charge. As a result of the first quarter restatement, revenues increased $10.8 million and net income before the cumulative effect increased $937,000. The restatement affected only the U.S. Tax operations segment.
     Implementation of the new accounting rule had the effect of increasing both revenues and expenses in the tax segment second quarter year-over-year comparison. The net effect was an increase of $1.3 million in net income for the second quarter.
Earnings Guidance
     H&R Block is increasing its earnings guidance for the fiscal year, which ends April 30. "We now expect to be at the top or above our long-term growth target for earnings. We expect earnings growth from 16 to 22 percent, or $3.65 to $3.85 per share. Revenue growth will likely be at the high end of our target range of 10 to 15 percent," Ernst said. The company had previously estimated earnings in the range of $3.56 to $3.72.
U.S. Tax Operations
     U.S. Tax Operations reported a pretax loss of $130.9 million, compared with $152.3 million last year, an improvement of $21.4 million. The prior year quarter included a $41.7 million charge for litigation settlement.
     Compared with last year, the higher operating costs were due to an increase in the number of tax offices, including new company operations in former franchise territories. Costs associated with the former major franchise territories during the quarter were $12.8 million, including $1.7 million of intangible amortization expense
 
H&R Block Reports Second Quarter Profit/page 3
related to assets acquired. Also, occupancy and equipment costs, excluding operations in former franchise territories, increased $5.9 million due primarily to an increase in the number of offices under lease.
     U.S. tax operations reported a 41.2 percent increase in revenues for the quarter to $47.2 million, compared with $33.4 million last year. For the six-month period, revenues increased 54.7 percent to $87.7 million, up $31 million from $56.7 million last year. The increase over the prior year is primarily due to the adoption of EITF 00-21.
     "During the quarter, we made substantial progress in transitioning former major franchise territories to company-owned operations. We're confident these offices will be ready for tax season 2004," Ernst said. In the former major franchise territories, there are 476 new company-owned locations and 238 locations now operated by direct franchises of the company. Approximately 1.2 million H&R Block clients were served in these territories last year.
     "Our tax management team is doing an outstanding job simultaneously preparing for tax season, transitioning former major franchise territories and managing off-season costs. We're expecting a solid year for our U.S. tax segment," Ernst said.
Mortgage Operations
     Mortgage operations, which includes Option One Mortgage Corp. and H&R Block Mortgage Corp, reported pretax earnings of $184 million, a 19.9 percent increase compared with $153.5 million last year. For the six-month period, pretax earnings increased 15.7 percent to $347.9 million, compared with $300.6 million last year.
     Second quarter revenues from mortgage operations increased 27.9 percent to $351.2 million, compared with $274.6 million last year. For the six-month period, revenues increased 24.6 percent to $654.1 million, compared with $524.9 million last year.
     "We're pleased with the mortgage segment results, which support our view that the interest rate environment should not have a dramatic effect on our levels of mortgage origination. Overall origination activity continued to be very strong in the quarter," Ernst said.
     For the second quarter, the company originated $6.3 billion in mortgage loans, a 63.5 percent increase over last year's $3.9 billion. The number of loan originations in the second quarter was 42,287, a 54.5 percent increase compared with last year.
     Mortgage servicing revenues for the quarter were $51.7 million, an increase of $10.3 million, or 25 percent, compared with $41.3 million last year. On Oct. 31, 2003, the servicing portfolio was $40.1 billion, an increase of $13.4 billion, or 50.2 percent, compared with Oct. 31, 2002, and up 17.8 percent over the previous quarter.

     Pretax income from H&R Block Mortgage increased 20.1 percent. Nearly half of the company's retail loans48.1 percentwere to clients of other H&R Block businesses.
     The segment's residual interests continued to perform better than expected, primarily due to loans performing better than modeled. Consequently, the company realized a net write-up in residual balances of $10.5 million, which was recorded in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet, net of deferred taxes.

     RSM McGladrey Business Services Inc. reported second quarter revenues of $109 million, an 11.4 percent increase compared with $97.9 million last year.
