H&R BLOCK REPORTS 59 CENTS PER SHARE THIRD QUARTER PROFIT
Early Tax Season Results Consistent with Full Year Guidance
FOR RELEASE FEBRUARY 24, 2004, 4 P.M. EST
     KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block Inc. (NYSE:HRB) today reported net income of $106.7 million, or 59 cents per diluted share, and record revenues of $977.2 million for the third quarter ended Jan. 31.
     Third quarter revenues increased 2 percent from $958.4 million last year. Third quarter net income declined $25.6 million or 19.3 percent compared with last year when the company reported third quarter earnings of $132.3 million, or 73 cents per diluted share. Third quarter 2004 results include a $17 million gain on sale of certain mortgage assets. Third quarter 2003 results include a $130.9 million gain on a similar transaction. Excluding the effect of these gains, third quarter net income increased $42.9 million or 80.2 percent over the prior year.
     The profitable third quarter marks the first time in the company's history that it has reported a profit in each of the first three quarters of its fiscal year. H&R Block typically reports losses in its first and second quarters, and often in its third quarter as well, due to the seasonal nature of its tax and business services units.
     "All of our business segments executed effectively and delivered improved performance. We saw double-digit revenue growth in each of our businesses, excluding the mortgage asset sales that we've noted," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark A. Ernst.
     "Performance in the tax filing season thus far is consistent with our overall expectations for a good, but not great, tax season," Ernst said. "After a slow start, growth in retail tax filing has accelerated in the month of February and our digital tax services are growing very well."
     The quarter results included $6.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, an expense that was not included in the comparable quarter last year.

H&R Block began to expense the costs of stock-based compensation at the beginning of the current fiscal year.
     For the nine-month period ending Jan. 31, the company reported net income of $122.3 million, a 43.1 percent increase compared with last year. Earnings per diluted share increased 45.7 percent to 67 cents. Revenues for the nine month period increased 10.8 percent to $2.1 billion.
     On a consolidated basis, the company continues to expect fiscal 2004 GAAP earnings-per-share in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 and revenue growth at the high end of its target range of 10 to 15 percent. Included in these expectations is about $24 million or 8-cents per share, of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.
U.S. Tax Operations
     U.S. Tax operations reported pretax earnings of $68.2 million, compared with $34.1 million last year, an improvement of $34.1 million. U.S. tax operations reported a 14.9 percent increase in revenues for the quarter to $463.6 million, compared with $403.6 million last year.
     Compared with last year, the improved performance is due to an increase in the number of clients served, increased revenue per client and better expense management. These improvements were partially off-set by expenses related to adding 873 tax locations to the company's retail network, including 459 company-owned offices in former franchise territories. Company-owned offices in former major franchise territories contributed $24.3 million to the increase in revenues.
     For the nine-month period, revenues increased 19.8 percent to $551.4 million, up $91.1 million from $460.3 million last year. The segment reported a $155.9 million pretax loss for the nine-month period, an improvement of $56.3 million or 26.5 percent compared with the $212.2 million pretax loss last year.
     From Jan. 1 through Jan. 31, tax preparation and related fees from retail tax offices increased 8.6 percent to $500.3 million. The average fee per client served rose 8.9 percent to $134.99. Total clients served, including office and digital tax solutions clients, increased 4.6 percent to 5 million. Retail tax offices served 3.7 million clients, a 0.2 percent decline from last year. Clients served by H&R Block's digital tax solutions increased 21.7 percent.
     For the tax season through Feb. 15, tax preparation and related fees from retail tax offices increased 3.9 percent to $1.1 billion. In the period ending Feb. 15, the average fee per client increased 8 percent to $135.48. Total clients served, including office and digital tax solutions clients, increased 0.1 percent to 9.9 million. Retail tax offices served 7.9 million clients, a decline of 3.9 percent from last year. Clients served by H&R Block's digital tax solutions increased 19.6 percent. However, year-over-year comparisons must be viewed cautiously due to the intra-week variability of tax filings and the difference in the days of the week included in the comparative periods.
     "While we saw a slow start to the tax filing season in our retail offices, the growth that we are seeing in February and the mix of clients that are coming to
 
H&R Block Reports Third Quarter Profit/page 3
H&R Block indicate that we are likely to be at the lower end of our expected range for retail client growth and at the higher end of our expected range for revenue per client," Ernst said. "Combined with superior performance in our digital businesses, we believe that we are on track to meet our overall targets for the year."
Mortgage Operations
     Mortgage operations, which include Option One Mortgage Corp. and H&R Block Mortgage Corp., reported pretax earnings of $154.5 million for the quarter, a $108 million decrease compared with pretax earnings of $262.5 million last year. For the nine-month period, pretax earnings decreased 10.8 percent to $502.3 million, compared with $563.1 million last year.
     Third quarter revenues from mortgage operations decreased 16.4 percent to $331.9 million, compared with $397 million last year. For the nine-month period, revenues increased 7 percent to $986 million, compared with $921.9 million last year.
     Third quarter 2004 results include a $17 million gain on sale of certain mortgage assets. Third quarter 2003 results include a $130.9 million gain on a similar transaction. Excluding the effect of these gains, third quarter pretax income from mortgage operations increased 4.5 percent.
     "We're pleased with the mortgage segment results, which continue to meet our expectations. These results support our long-held view that the interest rate environment would not have a significant effect on our mortgage performance. Overall origination activity continued to be strong in the quarter, while margins declined somewhat as we had expected." Ernst said.
     For the third quarter, the company originated $5.4 billion in mortgage loans, an 18.1 percent increase over last year's $4.5 billion. The number of loan originations in the third quarter was 35,795, a 15.8 percent increase compared with last year.
     Mortgage servicing revenues for the quarter were $55.1 million, an increase of $11.7 million, or 27 percent, compared with $43.4 million last year. On Jan. 31, 2004, the servicing portfolio was $42.2 billion, an increase of $13.3 billion, or 46 percent, compared with Jan. 31, 2003, and up 5.2 percent over the previous quarter.
     Third quarter pretax income from H&R Block Mortgage increased 25.9 percent. Nearly 40 percent of the company's retail loans were to clients of other H&R Block businesses.
     The segment's residual interests continued to perform better than expected, primarily due to better than modeled loss and interest rates. Consequently, the company realized a net write-up in residual balances of $36 million, which was recorded in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet, net of deferred taxes.

Business Services
     RSM McGladrey Business Services Inc. reported third quarter revenues of $112.3 million, an 11.5 percent increase compared with $100.7 million last year. The segment reported pretax earnings of $2 million, a $6.2 million improvement, compared with a loss of $4.2 million in the third quarter last year.
     For the nine-month period, revenues increased 8.8 percent to $319.8 million. The segment reported a pretax loss of $7.5 million compared with a pretax loss of $12.3 million last year.
     "Our capital markets business enjoyed another strong quarter compared with last year. Higher fees in our core accounting and tax services also contributed to improved performance," Ernst said.
Investment Services
     H&R Block Financial Advisors Inc. reported third quarter revenues of $57.8 million, an increase of 20.2 percent compared with the same quarter last year. The segment reported a pretax loss of $12.8 million, a 59.7 percent improvement compared with last year's pretax loss of $31.8 million.
     "We saw strong improvement in all of the key drivers of the business this quarter," Ernst said. "Overall, results of our Financial Advisors business reflect sustained changes that should allow us to have continuing performance improvement."
     For the nine-month period, revenues increased 6.8 percent to $167.4 million, compared with $156.7 million last year. The segment reported a pretax loss of $41.9 million compared with $92.5 million in the first nine months of last year, which included $24 million in goodwill impairment charges.
International Tax Operations
     In the third quarter, revenues from international tax operations increased 23.6 percent to $10.8 million, compared with $8.8 million last year. The segment reported a pretax loss of $6.4 million, compared with a pretax loss of $5.7 million last year.
     For the nine-month period, revenues increased 24.7 percent to $35.4 million. The segment reported a $12.3 million pretax loss, compared with last year's pretax loss of $12.4 million.
     "We enjoyed a successful conclusion to the tax season in Australia. However, unfavorable exchanges rates in Canada resulted in a higher loss for the quarter," Ernst said.
