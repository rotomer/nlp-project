The Securities will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor pursuant to guarantees (the "Guarantee") endorsed on the Securities under the terms of the Indenture.

The Underwriting Agreement, including these Standard Provisions, is sometimes referred to herein as this "Agreement." The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement are several and not joint. 1. Registration Statement. The Company and the Parent Guarantor have prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-33655) and a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-11802001), which registration statement includes a combined prospectus covering both registration statements pursuant to Rule 429 of the Securities Act (the "Basic Prospectus"), relating to the debt securities to be issued from time to time by the Company. The Company and the Parent Guarantor have also filed, or propose to file,
2 with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The registration statement, as amended at the time it becomes effective, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness ("Rule 430 Information"), is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement"; and as used herein, the term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus as supplemented by the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities and the term "Preliminary Prospectus" means the preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities together with the Basic Prospectus.

10 Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Preliminary Prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company and the Parent Guarantor in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein; provided, that with respect to any such untrue statement in or omission from any Preliminary Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter to the extent that the sale to the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability was an initial resale by such Underwriter and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of or with respect to such Underwriter results from the fact that both (i) to the extent required by applicable law, a copy of the Prospectus was not sent or given to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person and (ii) the untrue statement in or omission from such Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus unless, in either case, such failure to deliver the Prospectus was a result of non-compliance by the Company or the Parent Guarantor with the provisions of Section 4 hereof. (b) Indemnification of the Company and the Parent Guarantor. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Parent Guarantor and each of their respective officers and directors who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Parent Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company or the Parent Guarantor in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Preliminary Prospectus, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information identified in the Underwriting Agreement as being provided by the Underwriters. (c) Notice and Procedures. If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the
11 "Indemnifying Person") in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representative and any such separate firm for the Company, the Parent Guarantor or any of their respective directors or officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company or the Parent Guarantor shall be designated in writing by the Parent Guarantor. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request, (ii) the Indemnifying Party has received notice of the terms of the settlement at least 30 days prior to the settlement being entered into and (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time
12 an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person. (d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Parent Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Parent Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Parent Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company and the Parent Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Parent Guarantor or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. (e) Limitation on Liability. The Company, the Parent Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were
13 treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint. (f) Non-Exclusive Remedies. The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity. 7. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or the Parent Guarantor shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Prospectus. 8. Defaulting Underwriter. (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the
14 Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in the Underwriting Agreement that, pursuant to this Section 8, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8 shall be without liability on the part of the Company or the Parent Guarantor, except that the Company and the Parent Guarantor will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 9(a) hereof. (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company, the Parent Guarantor or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default. 9. Payment of Expenses. (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company and the Parent Guarantor, jointly and severally agree to pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of this Agreement, the Securities and the Indenture (including the Guarantee set forth therein) (collectively, the "Transaction Documents"); (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's and the Parent Guarantor's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
15 registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of any offering by, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; and (ix) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors. (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7, (ii) the Company and the Parent Guarantor for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities because any condition to the obligation of the underwriters set forth in Section 5 is not satisfied, the Company and the Parent Guarantor, jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their outside counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby promptly upon receipt of an itemized invoice of such out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

Wiggin, Samuel Woolverton and Edward F. C. Young, all being persons of full age and citizens of the United States, and a majority of us being residents of the State of New York, desiring to form a corporation to be known as a Trust Company, do hereby associate ourselves together for that purpose under and pursuant to the laws of the State of New York, and for such purpose we do hereby, under our respective hands and seals, execute and duly acknowledge this Organization Certificate in duplicate, and hereby specifically state as follows, to wit: I. The name by which the said corporation shall be known is Bankers Trust Company. II. The place where its business is to be transacted is the City of New York, in the State of New York. III.

the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and for all other purposes, each holder of the Common Stock being entitled to one vote for each share thereof held. 3. Liquidation: Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, and after the holders of the Series Preferred Stock of each series shall have been paid in full the amounts to which they respectively shall be entitled, or a sum sufficient for the payment in full set aside, the remaining net assets of the corporation shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of the Common Stock in accordance with their respective rights and interests, to the exclusion of the holders of the Series Preferred Stock. 4. Preemptive Rights: No holder of Common Stock of the corporation shall be entitled, as such, as a matter of right, to subscribe for or purchase any part of any new or additional issue of stock of any class or series whatsoever, any rights or options to purchase stock of any class or series whatsoever, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or carrying rights or options to purchase stock of any class or series whatsoever, whether now or hereafter authorized, and whether issued for cash or other consideration, or by way of dividend or other distribution. (b) Series Preferred Stock 1. Board Authority: The Series Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time by the Board of Directors as herein provided in one or more series. The designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations of the Series Preferred Stock, and particularly of the shares of each series thereof, may, to the extent permitted by law, be similar to or may differ from those of any other series. The Board of Directors of the corporation is hereby expressly granted authority, subject to the provisions of this Article III, to issue from time to time Series Preferred Stock in one or more series and to fix from time to time before issuance thereof, by filing a certificate pursuant to the Banking Law, the number of shares in each such series of such class and all designations, relative rights (including the right, to the extent permitted by law, to convert into shares of any class or into shares of any series of any class), preferences and limitations of the shares in each such series, including, buy without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: (i) The number of shares to constitute such series (which number may at any time, or from time to time, be increased or decreased by the Board of Directors, notwithstanding that shares of the series may be outstanding at the time of such increase or decrease, unless the Board of Directors shall have otherwise provided in creating such series) and the distinctive designation thereof; (ii) The dividend rate on the shares of such series, whether or not dividends on the shares of such series shall be cumulative, and the date or dates, if any, from which dividends thereon shall be cumulative; (iii)Whether or not the share of such series shall be redeemable, and, if redeemable, the date or dates upon or after which they shall be redeemable, the amount or amounts per share (which shall be, in the case of each share, not less than its preference upon involuntary liquidation, plus an amount equal to all dividends thereon accrued and unpaid, whether or not earned or declared) payable thereon in the case of the redemption thereof, which amount may vary at different redemption dates or otherwise as permitted by law; (iv) The right, if any, of holders of shares of such series to convert the same into, or exchange the same for, Common Stock or other stock as permitted by law, and the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange, as well as provisions for adjustment of the conversion rate in such events as the Board of Directors shall determine; (v) The amount per share payable on the shares of such series upon the voluntary and involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation;
(vi) Whether the holders of shares of such series shall have voting power, full or limited, in addition to the voting powers provided by law and, in case additional voting powers are accorded, to fix the extent thereof; and (vii)Generally to fix the other rights and privileges and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such rights and privileges of such series, provided, however, that no such rights, privileges, qualifications, limitations or restrictions shall be in conflict with the organization certificate of the corporation or with the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of any series of which there are shares outstanding. All shares of Series Preferred Stock of the same series shall be identical in all respects, except that shares of any one series issued at different times may differ as to dates, if any, from which dividends thereon may accumulate. All shares of Series Preferred Stock of all series shall be of equal rank and shall be identical in all respects except that to the extent not otherwise limited in this Article III any series may differ from any other series with respect to any one or more of the designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations described or referred to in subparagraphs (I) to (vii) inclusive above. 2. Dividends: Dividends on the outstanding Series Preferred Stock of each series shall be declared and paid or set apart for payment before any dividends shall be declared and paid or set apart for payment on the Common Stock with respect to the same quarterly dividend period. Dividends on any shares of Series Preferred Stock shall be cumulative only if and to the extent set forth in a certificate filed pursuant to law. After dividends on all shares of Series Preferred Stock (including cumulative dividends if and to the extent any such shares shall be entitled thereto) shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment with respect to any quarterly dividend period, then and not otherwise so long as any shares of Series Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding, dividends may be declared and paid or set apart for payment with respect to the same quarterly dividend period on the Common Stock out the assets or funds of the corporation legally available therefor. All Shares of Series Preferred Stock of all series shall be of equal rank, preference and priority as to dividends irrespective of whether or not the rates of dividends to which the same shall be entitled shall be the same and when the stated dividends are not paid in full, the shares of all series of the Series Preferred Stock shall share ratably in the payment thereof in accordance with the sums which would be payable on such shares if all dividends were paid in full, provided, however, that any two or more series of the Series Preferred Stock may differ from each other as to the existence and extent of the right to cumulative dividends, as aforesaid. 3. Voting Rights: Except as otherwise specifically provided in the certificate filed pursuant to law with respect to any series of the Series Preferred Stock, or as otherwise provided by law, the Series Preferred Stock shall not have any right to vote for the election of directors or for any other purpose and the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and for all other purposes. 4. Liquidation: In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, each series of Series Preferred Stock shall have preference and priority over the Common Stock for payment of the amount to which each outstanding series of Series Preferred Stock shall be entitled in accordance with the provisions thereof and each holder of Series Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid in full such amount, or have a sum sufficient for the payment in full set aside, before any payments shall be made to the holders of the Common Stock. If, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the assets of the corporation or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the shares of all series of the Series Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among such holders ratably in accordance with the respective amounts which would be payable if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. After the payment to the holders of Series Preferred Stock of all such amounts to which they are entitled, as above provided, the remaining assets and funds of the corporation shall be divided and paid to the holders of the Common Stock. 5. Redemption: In the event that the Series Preferred Stock of any series shall be made redeemable as provided in clause (iii) of paragraph 1 of section (b) of this Article III, the corporation, at the option of the Board of Directors, may redeem at any time or times, and from time to time, all or any part of any one or more series of Series Preferred Stock outstanding by paying for each share the then applicable
redemption price fixed by the Board of Directors as provided herein, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends to the date fixed for redemption, upon such notice and terms as may be specifically provided in the certificate filed pursuant to law with respect to the series. 6. Preemptive Rights: No holder of Series Preferred Stock of the corporation shall be entitled, as such, as a matter or right, to subscribe for or purchase any part of any new or additional issue of stock of any class or series whatsoever, any rights or options to purchase stock of any class or series whatsoever, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or carrying rights or options to purchase stock of any class or series whatsoever, whether now or hereafter authorized, and whether issued for cash or other consideration, or by way of dividend. (c) Provisions relating to Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A. (Liquidation value $1,000,000 per share.) 1. Designation: The distinctive designation of the series established hereby shall be "Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A" (hereinafter called "Series A Preferred Stock"). 2. Number: The number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall initially be 250 shares. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued Series Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. 3. Dividends: (a) Dividend Payments Dates. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive non-cumulative cash dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the corporation, out of funds legally available therefor, from the date of original issuance of such shares (the "Issue Date") and such dividends will be payable on March 28, June 28, September 28 and December 28 of each year ("Dividend Payment Date") commencing September 28, 1990, at a rate per annum as determined in paragraph 3(b) below. The period beginning on the Issue Date and ending on the day preceding the first Dividend Payment Date and each successive period beginning on a Dividend Payment Date and ending on the date preceding the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date is herein called a "Dividend Period". If any Dividend Payment Date shall be, in The City of New York, a Sunday or a legal holiday or a day on which banking institutions are authorized by law to close, then payment will be postponed to the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on the Dividend Payment Date, and no interest shall accrue for such Dividend Period after such Dividend Payment Date. (b) Dividend Rate. The dividend rate from time to time payable in respect of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Dividend Rate") shall be determined on the basis of the following provisions: (i) On the Dividend Determination Date, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the offered rates for deposits in U.S. dollars having a maturity of three months commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Dividend Determination Date, as such rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page as of 11:00 A.M. London time, on such Dividend Determination Date. If at least two such offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page, LIBOR in respect of such Dividend Determination Dates will be the arithmetic mean (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a percent, with five one-thousandths of a percent rounded upwards) of such offered rates. If fewer than those offered rates appear, LIBOR in respect of such Dividend Determination Date will be determined as described in paragraph (ii) below. (ii) On any Dividend Determination Date on which fewer than those offered rates for the applicable maturity appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page as specified in paragraph (I) above, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars having a maturity of three months commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Dividend Determination Date and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time are offered by three major banks in the London interbank market selected by the corporation at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such Dividend Determination Date to prime banks in the London market. The corporation will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR in respect of such Dividend Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a
percent, with five one-thousandths of a percent rounded upwards) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR in respect of such Dividend Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a percent, with five one-thousandths of a percent rounded upwards) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the corporation at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Dividend Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having a maturity of three months commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Dividend Determination Date and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks selected as aforesaid by the corporation are not quoting as aforementioned in this sentence, then, with respect to such Dividend Period, LIBOR for the preceding Dividend Period will be continued as LIBOR for such Dividend Period. (ii) The Dividend Rate for any Dividend Period shall be equal to the lower of 18% or 50 basis points above LIBOR for such Dividend Period as LIBOR is determined by sections (I) or (ii) above. As used above, the term "Dividend Determination Date" shall mean, with respect to any Dividend Period, the second London Business Day prior to the commencement of such Dividend Period; and the term "London Business Day" shall mean any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that, in New York City, is not a day on which banking institutions generally are authorized or required by law or executive order to close and that is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. 4. Voting Rights: The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have the voting power and rights set forth in this paragraph 4 and shall have no other voting power or rights except as otherwise may from time to time be required by law. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the votes of the Series Preferred Stock entitled to vote outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by resolution adopted at a meeting at which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (alone or together with the holders of one or more other series of Series Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote) vote separately as a class, alter the provisions of the Series Preferred Stock so as to materially adversely affect its rights; provided, however, that in the event any such materially adverse alteration affects the rights of only the Series A Preferred Stock, then the alteration may be effected with the vote or consent of at least a majority of the votes of the Series A Preferred Stock; provided, further, that an increase in the amount of the authorized Series Preferred Stock and/or the creation and/or issuance of other series of Series Preferred Stock in accordance with the organization certificate shall not be, nor be deemed to be, materially adverse alterations. In connection with the exercise of the voting rights contained in the preceding sentence, holders of all series of Series Preferred Stock which are granted such voting rights (of which the Series A Preferred Stock is the initial series) shall vote as a class (except as specifically provided otherwise) and each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall have one vote for each share of stock held and each other series shall have such number of votes, if any, for each share of stock held as may be granted to them. The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, in connection with the matters specified, provision is made for the redemption or retirement of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. 5. Liquidation: Subject to the provisions of section (b) of this Article III, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have preference and priority over the Common Stock for payment out of the assets of the corporation or proceeds thereof, whether from capital or surplus, of $1,000,000 per share (the "liquidation value") together with the amount of all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon, and after such payment the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to no other payments. 6. Redemption: Subject to the provisions of section (b) of this Article III, Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed, at the option of the corporation in whole or part, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price of $1,000,000 per share, in each case plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption.
At the option of the corporation, shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed or otherwise acquired may be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Series Preferred Stock. In the case of any redemption, the corporation shall give notice of such redemption to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed in the following manner: a notice specifying the shares to be redeemed and the time and place of redemption (and, if less than the total outstanding shares are to be redeemed, specifying the certificate numbers and number of shares to be redeemed) shall be mailed by first class mail, addressed to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses as the same shall appear upon the books of the corporation, not more than sixty (60) days and not less than thirty (30) days previous to the date fixed for redemption. In the event such notice is not given to any shareholder such failure to give notice shall not affect the notice given to other shareholders. If less than the whole amount of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by lot or pro rata in any manner determined by resolution of the Board of Directors to be fair and proper. From and after the date fixed in any such notice as the date of redemption (unless default shall be made by the corporation in providing moneys at the time and place of redemption for the payment of the redemption price) all dividends upon the Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and all rights of the holders of said Series A Preferred Stock as stockholders in the corporation, except the right to receive the redemption price (without interest) upon surrender of the certificate representing the Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption, duly endorsed for transfer, if required, shall cease and terminate. The corporation's obligation to provide moneys in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the redemption date, the corporation shall deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be an affiliate of the corporation) having an office in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, having a capital and surplus of at least $5,000,000 funds necessary for such redemption, in trust with irrevocable instructions that such funds be applied to the redemption of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption. Any interest accrued on such funds shall be paid to the corporation from time to time. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of two (2) years from such redemption date shall be released or repaid to the corporation, after which the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall look only to the corporation for payment of the redemption price.

stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of or reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the claimant is proper in the circumstance, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant is not entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant is not so entitled. SECTION 8. A person who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of a civil or criminal action or proceeding of the character described in Section 1 shall be entitled to indemnification only as provided in Sections 1 and 3, notwithstanding any provision of the New York Banking Law to the contrary. ARTICLE VI SEAL SECTION 1. The Board of Directors shall provide a seal for the Company, the counterpart dies of which shall be in the charge of the Secretary of the Company and such officers as the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary may from time to time direct in writing, to be affixed to certificates of stock and other documents in accordance with the directions of the Board of Directors or the Executive Committee. SECTION 2. The Board of Directors may provide, in proper cases on a specified occasion and for a specified transaction or transactions, for the use of a printed or engraved facsimile seal of the Company. ARTICLE VII CAPITAL STOCK SECTION 1. Registration of transfer of shares shall only be made upon the books of the Company by the registered holder in person, or by power of attorney, duly executed, witnessed and filed with the Secretary or other proper officer of the Company, on the surrender of the certificate or certificates of such shares properly assigned for transfer.
