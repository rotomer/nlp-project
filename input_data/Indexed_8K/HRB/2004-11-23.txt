H&R BLOCK REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS
Lower full-year earnings guidance on Mortgage outlook
FOR RELEASE NOV. 23, 2004 4 P.M. EST
     KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today reported a $52.2 million net loss for the second quarter of its 2005 fiscal year, compared with earnings of $10.4 million in the second quarter last year. Revenues totaled $539.3 million, a 5.2 percent decline from last year. The company reported a loss of 32 cents per diluted share, compared with 6 cents of earnings last year.
     The decline in earnings was due primarily to decreased income in the mortgage segment. An asset write-down in investment services and corporate development spending associated with new business initiatives also contributed to the earnings decline. Historically, H&R Block has reported second quarter losses because of the seasonal nature of its tax and accounting businesses, although the company reported a profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
     "The competitive environment in the mortgage industry limited our pricing flexibility in the face of rising interest rates in the secondary market," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark A. Ernst. "In view of industry-wide trends, we were satisfied with our levels of loan originations, which grew 2.7 percent compared with the second quarter last year, although operating margins did not improve as much as we had anticipated.
     "We will begin deploying a series of technology enabled service enhancements to our mortgage broker clients during the fourth quarter. We believe that these will improve productivity and position our mortgage business for success as we transition to a higher rate environment. Primarily due to the current mortgage pricing environment and investments in support of these technology enhancements, we are lowering our current fiscal year earnings guidance to the range of $3.50 to $4.00 per share," Ernst said.

In the second quarter, H&R Block acquired 3.8 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $182.2 million, or an average price of $47.81 per share. Over the past year, the number of H&R Block shares outstanding has decreased 8 percent to 163.5 million shares outstanding.
The second quarter results include $7.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, compared with $3.1 million last year. H&R Block began to expense the costs of all stock-based compensation at the beginning of fiscal year 2004.
For the six months ended Oct. 31, H&R Block reported a net loss of $96.3 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, compared with earnings of $15.5 million last year, or 9 cents per diluted share. Revenues for the six-month period decreased 4 percent to $1 billion, from $1.1 billion last year.
The prior year results include a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-21 (EITF 00-21) as of May 1, 2003. This change reduced last year's first quarter net income by $6.4 million, or 3 cents per diluted share.
Tax Services
     Tax services revenues increased 11.8 percent to $74.1 million. The segment reported a pretax loss of $134 million, which was 2.8 percent higher than the pretax loss of $130.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
     For the six-month period, revenues were $124.6 million, up $12.3 million from $112.3 million last year, a 10.9 percent increase. The pretax loss for the six-month period was $247 million, $17 million, or 7.4 percent, higher than last year.
     "We continue on pace to open more than 600 new offices and 400 additional Wal-Mart locations. This investment in expanding our office network will make our tax services more accessible and convenient to a greater number of tax filers, which we expect will drive client growth this tax season. Our off-season costs remain in line with our expectations," Ernst said.
Mortgage Services
Mortgage services, which include Option One Mortgage Corp. and H&R Block Mortgage Corp., reported second quarter pretax income of $106.2 million, a 42.3 percent decline, compared with $184 million in the second quarter last year.
Loan production increased to $6.5 billion for the quarter, a 2.7 percent increase over the previous year's quarter.
Included within these results, H&R Block Mortgage Corp., H&R Block's retail mortgage subsidiary, reported a 32.9 percent increase in originations. Retail clients of other H&R Block businesses generated 32 percent of H&R Block Mortgage's loan activity during the quarter.

Second quarter revenues declined 17.2 percent to $281.6 million, from $340.2 million the prior year. For the six-month period, revenues decreased 13.1 percent to $549.8 million from $632.8 million last year.
The mortgage segment's total gain on sales was $184.6 million for the second quarter, a 26.3 percent decline compared with $250.6 million in the prior year's second quarter. The decline in gain on sales is primarily due to increased price competition.
"We have seen increased costs this quarter due to investments we have made to expand distribution capacity, upgrade technology and improve our processes at Option One and H&R Block Mortgage. We believe these investments will drive increased productivity and position us for lower operating costs," Ernst said.
The segment's residual interests continued to perform better than expected. Consequently, the company realized a net write-up to residual balances of $35.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, which was recorded as other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes. The company did not realize any gains from the sale of residual assets in the quarter.
Business Services
Business services reported second quarter revenue of $129 million, representing growth of 18.4 percent over the same quarter last year. The second quarter pretax loss was $4.9 million compared with a pretax loss of $2.7 million in the same quarter last year.
For the six-month period, revenues increased 14.8 percent to $238.1 million from $207.5 million last year. The pretax loss was $15 million, an increase of $5.6 million, or 59.2 percent compared to a loss of $9.4 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2004.
"Our accounting and consulting businesses enjoyed strong off-season revenue growth in all of our core service lines, and benefited from strong demand for consulting work and risk management services," Ernst said. "The development and implementation of our marketing and sales infrastructure is going well. We're well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunity this market presents to us."
Investment Services
Investment services reported a second quarter pretax loss of $24.6 million, an increase of $9.2 million compared with last year's $15.3 million loss. The second quarter loss included a $6 million write-down of a branch office facility. Investment services reported second quarter revenues of $53.8 million, a 2 percent increase from the same quarter last year.
The pretax loss for the second quarter increased 34.5 percent, or $6.3 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. Revenues improved slightly, up .3 percent compared with first quarter revenues of $53.6 million.

"The general market climate for investment services remained very weak during the early months of the quarter, though we began to see improvement in October and into November," Ernst said.

H&R Block's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 22 cents per share, payable Jan. 3, 2005, to shareholders of record Dec. 13, 2004. This payment will be the company's 169th consecutive quarterly dividend.
