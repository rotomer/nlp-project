H&R BLOCK RESCHEDULES FILING OF ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K
 
FOR RELEASE JULY 8, 2005
 
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block Inc. (NYSE:HRB) today disclosed that it will not file its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the prescribed due date of July 14, 2005. The company plans to file a notification of late filing with the SEC to extend the filing due date to July 29, 2005, and anticipates filing the 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K by the extended filing due date.
 
The delayed filing is due to additional time required for the company to finalize its restatement of results for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, as previously reported in its fiscal year-end press release on June 8, 2005.
 
Due to the delay in the Annual Report and Form 10-K filing, the company will also reschedule reporting its first quarter results from the previously announced date of Aug. 18, 2005. The company expects to report first quarter results on Sept. 1, 2005.
