H&R BLOCK EXPECTS TO REPORT PROVISION FOR LOSSES RELATED TO INCREASE IN LOAN REPURCHASES
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Aug. 24, 2006
 
 
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today announced that it expects to record a provision for losses of $102.1 million (after-tax amount of $61.3 million or 19 cents per share) reflecting an increase to the estimated recourse liability recorded by Option One Mortgage Corporation for loan repurchases and premium recapture reserves. The expected provision includes $46.1 million related to loans sold during the quarter ended July 31 and an increase of $56.0 million related to loans sold in previous quarters. The Company expects to increase the estimated recourse liability primarily as a result of recent increases in loan repurchases from its loan sale transactions. The increased level of loan repurchases, which have been noted industrywide, are primarily due to a higher level of repurchase requests from loan buyers and an increase in early payment delinquencies.
 
The Company will provide additional details when it announces its first quarter fiscal 2007 results on Thursday, Aug. 31, 2006 after market close and will host a conference call for analysts, institutional investors and shareholders at 5 p.m. EDT (4 p.m. CDT) Aug. 31.
