Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 21, 2006, Option One Mortgage Corporation ("OOMC") and Option One Loan Warehouse Corporation ("OOLWC"), wholly owned subsidiaries of H&R Block, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into Omnibus Amendment Number One to the Option One Owner Trust Facility dated as of September 21, 2006, among OOMC, OOLWC, Option One Owner Trust 2005-7 (the "Trust"), Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. ("Wells Fargo"), HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., HSBC Bank USA, N.A. ("HSBC"), and Bryant Park Funding LLC (the "Amendment").
 
The primary purpose of the Amendment was to extend the term of OOMC's off-balance sheet financing arrangement with HSBC to fund daily non-prime originations through October 31, 2006, subject to various triggers, events or occurrences that could result in earlier termination (the "HSBC Warehouse Facility").
 
Under the HSBC Warehouse Facility, non-prime loans originated by OOMC are sold daily to the Trust, which utilizes the HSBC Warehouse Facility to purchase the loans. The Trust subsequently sells the loans directly to third-party investors or back to OOMC to pool the loans for securitization, as directed by its third-party beneficial interest holders. The decision to complete a whole loan sale or a securitization is dependent on market conditions. See "Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements" in Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2006.
 
Certain parties to the HSBC Warehouse Facility have other relationships with the Company or its affiliates. HSBC and an affiliate of Wells Fargo are lending parties pursuant to two $1,000,000,000 five-year revolving credit facilities maintained by Block Financial Corporation, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, with various lenders.
 
 
The information set forth under Item 1.01(a) of this report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated in this Item 2.03 by reference.
 
Pursuant to the HSBC Warehouse Facility, OOMC provides a guarantee up to a maximum of approximately 10% of the aggregate principal balance of mortgage loans held by the Trust before ultimate disposition. This guarantee would be called upon if the sale of mortgage loans did not generate adequate proceeds to satisfy the Trust's current or ultimate payment obligations. The maximum potential undiscounted amount of future payments that OOMC may be required to make pursuant to this guarantee would be approximately $100,000,000.
