Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 5, 2007, Option One Mortgage Corporation ("OOMC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of H&R Block, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into Omnibus Amendment No. 7 dated as of January 5, 2007 among OOMC, Option One Owner Trust 2002-3 (the "UBS Trust") and UBS Real Estate Securities Inc. ("UBS") (the "UBS Amendment").
 
The primary purpose of the UBS Amendment was to extend the term of OOMC's off-balance sheet financing arrangement with UBS (the "UBS Warehouse Facility") to January 19, 2007, subject to various triggers, events or occurrences that could result in earlier termination.
 
The UBS Warehouse Facility provides funding totaling $1,500,000,000, bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus a margin rate and provides for the payment of minimum usage fees. The UBS Warehouse Facility is also subject to various OOMC performance triggers, limits and financial covenants, including a tangible net worth requirement, capital adequacy test, net income test, liquidity requirements, leverage ratios and cross-default features in which a default under other arrangements to fund daily non-prime originations would trigger a default under the UBS Warehouse Facility.
 
Under the UBS Warehouse Facility, non-prime loans originated by OOMC are sold daily to the UBS Trust, which utilizes the UBS Warehouse Facility to purchase the loans. The UBS Trust subsequently sells the loans directly to third-party investors or back to OOMC to pool the loans for securitization, as directed by its third-party beneficial interest holders. The decision to complete a whole loan sale or a securitization is dependent on market conditions. See "Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements" in Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2006.
 
Certain parties to the UBS Warehouse Facility have other relationships with the Company or its affiliates. Affiliates of UBS and Wells Fargo are lending parties pursuant to credit facilities maintained by Block Financial Corporation, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, with various lenders.
