Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On May 15, 2007, Option One Mortgage Corporation, ("OOMC"), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of H&R Block, Inc. (the "Company"), announced a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies in response to reduced mortgage loan origination volumes and current secondary market pricing levels. As part of this restructuring, OOMC committed on May 15, 2007, to staff reductions under a plan of termination that will eliminate approximately 615 positions.
The Company expects to incur a pre-tax restructuring charge in fiscal year 2008 of approximately $19 million in connection with the restructuring plan (approximately $17 million of which will result in future cash expenditures). The restructuring charge consists of approximately $11 million in one-time termination benefits, approximately $6 million in lease termination costs and approximately $2 million in other miscellaneous costs. OOMC expects to complete the restructuring by October 31, 2007.
