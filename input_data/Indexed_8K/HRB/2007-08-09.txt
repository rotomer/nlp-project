Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On August 6, 2007, Option One Mortgage Corporation ("OOMC"), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of H&R Block, Inc. (the "Company"), announced an expansion of the restructuring plan described in the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed on May 17, 2007. The restructuring plan is designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies in response to reduced mortgage loan origination volumes and current secondary market pricing levels. On August 6, 2007, OOMC committed to further staff reductions that OOMC expects to effect before December 31, 2007, and it is possible that OOMC may commit to additional restructuring actions. The Company presently is unable to estimate the incremental costs associated with the expanded restructuring. The Company continues to work toward a closing of the sale of OOMC in its second fiscal quarter, although it may close during the third quarter of its fiscal year 2008 on or before December 31, 2007.
