Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement.
On November 23, 2007, Block Financial Corporation ("BFC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of H&R Block, Inc. (the "Company"), drew a combined $75.0 million under its $1.0 billion Five-Year Credit and Guarantee Agreement dated August 10, 2005 and its $1.0 billion Amended and Restated Five-Year Credit and Guarantee Agreement dated August 10, 2005 (collectively, the "CLOCs"). The total amount currently outstanding under the CLOCs is $1.8 billion. The $75.0 million draw bears interest at the ABR rate (as defined in the CLOCs) and is subject to adjustments as set forth in the CLOCs. The amounts borrowed under the CLOCs become due and payable on August 10, 2010.
The CLOCs contain representations, warranties, covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type, including a minimum net worth covenant and a short-term debt "clean-down" requirement, each as more fully described in the Company's Report on Form 8-K dated November 16, 2007. The CLOCs also include, without limitation, covenants restricting the Company's and BFC's ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, merge or consolidate with other companies, sell or dispose of their respective assets (including equity interests), liquidate or dissolve, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.
In the event of a default by the Company or BFC under the CLOCs, the Administrative Agent may, or at the direction of the requisite lenders shall, terminate the applicable CLOC and declare the loans then outstanding, together with any accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Company and BFC under such CLOC, to be due and payable immediately.
