The HSBC Amended Bridge Facility matures on April 30, 2008. The terms of the HSBC Bridge Facility are similar to the terms of two $1,000,000,000 five-year revolving credit facilities maintained by BFC with various lenders dated August 10, 2005 (the "BFC Credit Facilities"), including customary acceleration terms upon an event of default by the Company or BFC.
