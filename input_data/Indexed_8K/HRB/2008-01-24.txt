Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 22, 2008, the following agreements (collectively, the "Servicing Advance Amendment") were entered into regarding the financing facility maintained by Option One Mortgage Corporation ("OOMC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of H&R Block, Inc. (the "Company"), to fund servicing advances (the "Servicing Advance Facility"):
The primary purpose of the Servicing Advance Amendment was to (i) increase the amount of funding available through the Servicing Advance Facility from $800,000,000 to $1,200,000,000 and (ii) add Deutsche as a party to the Servicing Advance Facility.
 
The Servicing Advance Facility provides funding totaling $1,200,000,000 to fund servicing advances through September 29, 2008 and bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus an additional margin rate. The Servicing Advance Facility is subject to various triggers, events, conditions or occurrences that could result in earlier termination and cross-default features in which a default with respect to other OOMC indebtedness would trigger a default under the Servicing Advance Facility. The Servicing Advance Facility terminates upon a "change in control" of OOMC, in which (i) a party or parties acting in concert acquire a 20% or more equity interest in OOMC or (ii) the Company does not own more than a 50% equity interest in OOMC.
 
Certain parties to the Servicing Advance Facility have other relationships with the Company or its affiliates. Affiliates of Greenwich, Deutsche and Wells Fargo are lending parties pursuant to credit facilities maintained by Block Financial Corporation, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, with various lenders. In addition, Wells Fargo serves as the indenture trustee under a mortgage warehouse facility maintained by OOMC and its affiliates.
