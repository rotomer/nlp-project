Current period earnings from continuing operations after the severance charge were $9.3 million, or $0.03 per share.
          For the quarter, total revenues from continuing operations rose 4.4% to $972.6 million, compared with $931.2 million in the year-ago period. This reflects top-line growth in the Tax Services segment of $33.9 million and at H&R Block Bank of $16.8 million.

          "This quarter marks the first full quarter of our new management team, and of our renewed focus on H&R Block's preeminent tax services practice. In every possible area of the tax market we are trying to sharpen focus and competitive intensity," said Richard C. Breeden, Chairman of H&R Block. "We are only halfway through tax season, but we believe we have good marketplace traction and excellent opportunities based on our market share, the quality of our tax professionals and the strength of our brand. To date, we are seeing a healthy increase in both the number of retail tax clients served and average revenue per retail tax client," added Mr. Breeden. "At the same time in every sector of our business, we are adding discipline to the capital allocation process and seeking to eliminate costs to improve our competitive strength."
          During the quarter, the net loss from discontinued operations was $56.6 million, or $0.17 per share, compared with a loss of $82.2 million, or $0.25 per share in the prior year. The Company reported a net loss from discontinued operations of $366.2 million, or $1.13 per share, during the second quarter of fiscal 2008. This loss in the current period reflects loan loss provisions and repurchase reserves, impairments of residual interests and expenses related to the previously announced closing of origination activities. Total remaining loans held both on and off balance sheet by the company for sale at Option One are now $21.9 million, net of reserves.
          Net loss for the quarter was $47.4 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to a net loss of $60.3 million, or $0.18 per share, in the prior year.
          For the nine months ended January 31, 2008, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $236.6 million, or $0.73 per share, an increase of 9.1% from a net loss of $216.9 million, or $0.67 per share, in the prior-year period. For the nine months, discontinued operations posted a net loss of $615.6 million, or $1.90 per share, compared to a prior-period net loss of $131.2 million, or $0.41 per share. For the nine month period consolidated net loss was $852.2 million, or $2.63 per share, compared with a net loss of $348.1 million, or $1.08 per share, in the comparable period during fiscal year 2007.
Tax Services
          For the quarter ended January 31, revenue in the Tax Services segment grew 5.4% year-over-year. Net tax preparation and related fees increased 3.3%, reflecting a 7.0% increase in net average fee per U. S. retail client served to $172.58. This was partially offset by a 3.5% decline in retail clients served through January 31. The company believes the decline in clients reflects a slow start to the tax season due to various factors, including uncertainty surrounding legislation regarding the Alternate Minimum Tax.
          Pretax income from the tax segment for the period ended January 31 was $45.9 million, down from $60.0 million in the prior year. The reduction in pretax income notwithstanding the increase in revenue results primarily from an adjustment in bad debt reserves due to the elimination during the quarter of certain cooperative collections arrangements related to settlement products.

          During the month of February 2008, the number of retail tax clients served increased 6.8% compared to February 2007, which had one less day. Also during February, net retail tax preparation and related fees increased approximately12.6% compared with the prior year. As of February 29, year-to-date client growth in retail tax preparation has been 2.6%. The Company believes that after adjustments for differences in the number of days in the respective periods, the total number of retail tax clients year-to-date is up by approximately 1.3% compared with the prior year, while the average retail fee year to date is up by approximately 6.1%.
          The company's digital tax business, consisting of TaxCut software and online products, showed a decline in the number of clients for the quarter ended January 31 of 10.8%. Digital revenues were down only 1.9% in the quarter, reflecting the mitigating impact of price increases.
          "Our tax business is tracking toward a solid season despite a slower start than in prior years. Volume increased nicely in February, and we are now putting our time and effort into ensuring that we have a strong close to our season," said Alan M. Bennett, interim CEO. "We are targeting growth in late season filers who value the expertise of our highly trained tax professionals. At the same time, we're hoping to see clients who aren't typically required to file come to Block to complete a 2007 tax return so they can receive the Economic Stimulus Package rebates," added Bennett.
Consumer Financial Services
          The Consumer Financial Services segment includes H&R Block Financial Advisors and H&R Block Bank. For the quarter ended January 31, segment revenues were $117.1 million, up 8.9% from $107.5 million in the prior period. Pretax income during the quarter grew nearly 19% to $13.0 million, all of which was attributable to income growth at H&R Block Bank. Nine month segment revenues were $332.7 million, up 24.2% from $267.9 million a year earlier. Pretax income rose 81.5% to $10.1 million from $5.6 million.
          The Company has continued to experience strong customer acceptance of its Emerald Card. By the end of the season, the company projects aggregate growth of more than 25% in the number of clients with an Emerald Card. Through January 31, we extended an Emerald Advance line of credit to nearly 900,000 clients, providing more than $400 million in aggregate credit. This new program increased aggregate bank revenues and also helped maintain tax client retention rates. Overall, revenues at H&R Block Bank were $39.3 million, up 75.0% from $22.5 million in the prior year period, while pretax income was $12.3 million, up 90.9% from $6.5 million in the prior year period.
          "Our Emerald Card is proving quite popular with clients who can use it to avoid expensive third-party check cashing services," said Tim Gokey, President of H&R Block's Retail Tax Services. "We believe that the Emerald Card is assisting with client retention, and we see growing use of the Emerald Card by customers for direct deposit of paychecks. The Emerald Advance line of credit that was a new product for existing tax customers this year gives us an alternative to traditional tax-related financial products that we believe will prove important in the future," said Gokey.

          Fiscal 2008 third quarter revenues at H&R Block Financial Advisors declined 8.5% to $77.8 million, reflecting challenging market conditions including declining interest rates. Pretax income declined 85.1% to $0.7 million from $4.5 million in the prior period.
Business Services
          For the quarter ended January 31, Business Services had revenues of $191.9 million, which were essentially flat compared with the same quarter last year. Pretax income for the quarter was $6.6 million, compared with pretax income of $1.2 million last year. This increase in income in part reflects improved operating efficiencies as previously acquired businesses were integrated into the Company's McGladrey unit.
          For the nine months, revenues rose to $623.8 million from $616.3 million, while pretax income was $16.5 million compared to a loss in the prior period of $4.7 million.
          During the quarter McGladrey established an expense reduction program parallel to that previously announced by H&R Block as a whole for overhead costs. McGladrey has identified initial cost reductions of $15 million annually starting in fiscal 2009, and these cost reductions were not previously included in the Company's overall cost saving projections.
