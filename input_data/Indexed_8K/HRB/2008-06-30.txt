KANSAS CITY, Mo. - H&R Block Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today reported that fiscal 2008 earnings from continuing operations grew 21 percent to $454.5 million, or $1.39 per share, compared to $374.3 million, or $1.15 per share for the prior year. Full year revenues rose 10 percent to $4.4 billion, primarily reflecting growth in Tax Services. For its fiscal fourth quarter ended April 30, 2008, earnings from continuing operations were $691.1 million, or $2.11 per share, up 17 percent compared with $591.2 million, or $1.81 per share, in the prior-year period. Fourth quarter revenues increased 11 percent to $2.6 billion.
 
During fiscal 2008, H&R Block served the tax needs of 23.5 million clients, the highest level in our history. Full year earnings per share from continuing operations exceeded our expectations, and reflect the best tax season for H&R Block since 1999, said Richard C. Breeden, Chairman of the Board of H&R Block.
 
*all per share amounts are based on fully diluted shares.

These results also reflect significantly improved margins at our RSM McGladrey unit, one of the nations largest providers of tax and other professional services to small and medium sized businesses. We enter FY09 focused on opportunities to improve upon performance in each of our businesses.
 
For fiscal 2008, net loss from discontinued operations was $763.1 million, or $2.33 per share, compared to a prior-period net loss of $808.0 million, or $2.48 per share. During the fourth quarter, the net loss from discontinued operations was $147.6 million, or $0.45 per share, compared with a loss of $676.8 million, or $2.07 per share in the prior year. The losses reflect provisions for loan repurchase obligations, impairments of residual interests and expenses related to the Companys exit from its subprime mortgage business. The Company previously announced the cessation of Option Ones loan origination activities in December 2007, and it sold its mortgage servicing business effective April 30, 2008.
 
Consolidated net loss for the 12 months ended April 30, 2008 was $308.6 million, or $0.94 per share, compared with a net loss of $433.7 million, or $1.33 per share, for full year fiscal 2007. For the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter, consolidated net earnings were $543.6 million, or $1.66 per share, compared to a consolidated net loss of $85.6 million, or $0.26 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
 
Tax Services
 
Full year fiscal 2008 revenue in the Tax Services segment was $3.0 billion, an 11.3 percent increase over the prior year. Pretax income grew 11.4 percent to $785.8 million. H&R Block served a record 23.5 million clients, led by U.S. retail operations, and achieved a 4.3 percent increase in net average retail tax preparation fees per client.
 
During tax season 2008, H&R Block served approximately 290,000 clients who filed in order to qualify for the Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) payment. These one-time filers increased the reported client growth, but lowered the percentage of price increase from what would otherwise have been reported. Total U.S. retail clients served increased 3.8 percent overall, and 1.9 percent excluding ESP filers. This 1.9 percent growth in the number of core tax clients served compares with 0.9 percent in fiscal 2007. Overall client growth was 3.5 percent, reflecting growth of 1.9 percent in domestic retail, 6.1 percent in international, and 1.6 percent in overall digital clients (including free filers).
 
International tax operations also performed well in fiscal 2008, driven by strong results in Canada, with a 6.1 percent increase in clients served, 29 percent growth in revenues, and a 60 percent improvement in pretax income. More than one-half of the revenue increase and one-third of the profit increase is attributable to favorable exchange rates.
 
The Companys digital tax business consists of online filing services through hrblock.com and other online products, as well as the Companys TaxCut software. The Companys digital tax business grew online customers by 14 percent and increased revenues 10 percent year-over-year. The digital business also significantly increased its profitability through revenue increases and cost control. These positives were offset by a decline in software customers, driven by aggressive marketing by a major competitor. Total digital

customers  representing filers who paid H&R Block a fee as well as those who did not  grew 1.6 percent for the full year. Paid digital clients declined 4.3 percent.  
 
For the quarter ended April 30, revenue in the Tax Services segment grew 13.4 percent to $2.2 billion and pretax income increased 15.2 percent to $1.1 billion.
 
Business Services
 
The Companys RSM McGladrey unit, the nations fifth largest accounting firm, reported fiscal 2008 revenues of $941.7 million, and a 54 percent increase in pretax income to $88.8 million. McGladrey improved pretax operating margins in 2008 by 52 percent to 9.4 percent, compared with 6.2 percent in the prior year. Overall revenues at McGladrey were up 1 percent over the prior year, although revenue growth was approximately 8 percent prior to a change in the manner of recording revenues relating to the TBS business acquired from American Express. Revenues for McGladreys tax and consulting practices grew by 8 percent and 13 percent, respectively.
 
For the fourth quarter, Business Services had pretax income of $72.3 million, an increase of 16 percent over the same period a year ago. Pretax operating margin in the fourth quarter grew to 23 percent, compared with 20 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Fourth quarter revenues of $317.9 million were essentially flat compared with the same quarter last year.
 
Consumer Financial Services
 
The Consumer Financial Services segment includes H&R Block Bank and H&R Block Financial Advisors. Segment revenues from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 grew 19 percent to $460 million compared to the prior year, driven by an 85 percent increase in H&R Block Bank revenues. Pretax income fell 49 percent to $10.1 million, reflecting increased loan loss reserves at H&R Block Bank as well as reduced profitability at HRBFA in the latter half of the fiscal year due largely to lower interest rates.
 
For the quarter ended April 30, segment revenues were $127.2 million, up 5.8 percent from $120.2 million in the prior year period. Pretax income fell to $15 thousand compared with $14.2 million in the prior year period due to the factors described above.
 
H&R Block Banks revenue for FY08 grew 85 percent to $142.7 million, reflecting strong growth in the Banks business with the Companys tax customer base. Pretax income was $11.5 million, down 50 percent, after an increase of $38.4 million in loan loss reserves relating to the Banks portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment. Mortgage loans held for investment were $966.3 million at April 30, 2008, compared with $1.4 billion at the prior year end, a decline of $391.9 million, or 29 percent. The Bank anticipates continuing strong runoff of the total dollar amount of this portfolio through prepayments and other payments. Total assets of the Bank at year end fell to $1.1 billion, down 28 percent from $1.5 billion.
 
H&R Block Banks fourth quarter revenues grew 46 percent year-over-year to $53.1 million, primarily due to higher Emerald Card volume and the introduction of the new Emerald Advance line of credit. The Bank reported a pretax loss of $1.3 million for the

fourth quarter due to a $29.4 million increase in loss loan provisions, largely relating to its portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment.
 
During the tax season, the Bank increased the number of Emerald Cards issued by 30 percent to more than 2.6 million. The new Emerald Advance line of credit introduced in fiscal 2008 is a non-RAL credit product targeted exclusively at meeting the financial needs of tax customers without the disadvantages and costs traditionally associated with RAL products in the marketplace. The Bank approved just under one million Emerald Advance lines of credit in fiscal 2008, and approximately 91 percent of these customers returned to H&R Block for paid tax preparation. The Bank is anticipating a continued shift to use of Emerald Advance lines of credit in the future, with increases in both the number of customers and the aggregate available credit per customer as a gradual transition to a post-RAL world continues.
 
Overall, HRBFA increased revenues by 2 percent in fiscal 2008 to $317.2 million, while the pretax loss improved to $1.4 million from $3.3 million for the prior year. HRBFA results reflect a 6 percent increase in average productivity per advisor year-over-year and positive trends in recruiting and retention. However, these improvements were offset by the impact of declining market interest rates and lower underwriting fees in the second half of the fiscal year.
 
Fiscal 2008 fourth quarter revenues at HRBFA declined 11.6 percent to $74.1 million, compared to the prior year period. Pretax income for the fourth quarter was $1.3 million compared to $1.2 million a year ago.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
During the fourth quarter, the Company incurred a pretax loss of $191 million on discontinued operations, including the effect of increasing loss-severity on repurchased loans. However the expected loss on each dollar of repurchased loans has grown from 26 percent in the fourth quarter of FY07 to 62 percent in the fourth quarter of FY08, reflecting market deterioration. During the fourth quarter, the Company added approximately $203 million to its reserves in anticipation of future representation and warranty repurchases, bringing the total level of such reserves to more than $240 million. The Company believes this amount is adequate in current circumstances, based on the best information available to it regarding existing and currently anticipated claims, although there can be no assurance that further reserves will not be required.
 
Outlook
 
The Company expects fiscal 2009 earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per share. During fiscal 2009, the Company anticipates increasing marketing expenditures and making other investments to continue driving market share growth in core retail tax services, and to enhance market share in online and other digital tax solutions. The Company also has embarked on a program to refresh and upgrade the technology available in retail tax offices.

At the same time, the Company anticipates further steps to enhance margins in its field operations that it believes will yield considerable cost savings or margin improvements over the next three years. This program will include savings in occupancy expense through conversion of some locations from Company-operated full service locations to franchisee-operated Express Tax locations, improved controls on discounting, enhanced managerial efficiency and other steps to enhance margins without impairing customer growth patterns. The Company also anticipates continuing margin growth at its McGladrey unit, with pretax margins increasing to more than 12 percent in FY09. Margin expansion opportunities also exist with both H&R Block Bank and HRBFA.
 
We are prudently managing all our businesses for better performance and improved margins, said Alan Bennett, Interim Chief Executive Officer. While we are not providing earnings guidance beyond fiscal 2009, we are confident that for the three-year horizon through fiscal 2011, we can realize significant gains in earnings per share through unit growth, greater efficiency in our tax and other operations, and capital deployment, rather than relying solely on annual price increases for growth, added Bennett.
 
Dividends
 
H&R Blocks Board of Directors has voted to increase the annual cash dividend by three cents per share to 60 cents per share, resulting in a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share beginning with the dividend payable Oct. 1, 2008. This will represent the 11th consecutive year of dividend increases by the Company. The increase of three cents per share in dividends will result in an additional cash payout to shareowners of approximately $10 million per year.
 
Share Repurchases
 
The Companys Board of Directors has reviewed the Companys record and outlook for financial results and financial condition. The Company had net debt as of April 30, 2008, of $441.2 million, a reduction of $750.5 million or 63 percent since April 30, 2007. However, losses suffered by the Company during the last two years from its discontinued subprime mortgage operations also reduced stockholders equity below historic levels. After considering all relevant factors, the board voted to authorize $2 billion of share repurchases during the four-year period FY09  FY12, although the Company expects to be particularly disciplined in FY09 as it rebuilds its balance sheet. Initial purchases are not anticipated prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
 
The new authorization replaces and increases the prior remaining repurchase authorizations of 22 million shares. This is an authorization only, and there can be no assurance as to the actual volume of share repurchases in any given year, if any, which will depend on results of operations, financial condition and market conditions at any given time.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Unaudited
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The dilutive effect of potential common shares is included in diluted earnings per share.
Effective November 2006, our Board of Directors approved a plan to exit the mortgage business operated through our subsidiary, OOMC, and we began reporting that business as discontinued operations. During fiscal year 2007, we also committed to a plan to sell and/or completed the wind-down of three smaller lines of business previously reported in our Business Services segment, as well as our tax operations in the United Kingdom previously reported in Tax Services. These businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
During the third fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2008, OOMC ceased all loan origination activities, and initiated a plan to sell its remaining servicing operations. On April 30, 2008, OOMC sold its loan servicing assets to an affiliate of WL Ross & Co. LLC (WL Ross) pursuant to a previously announced agreement dated March 17, 2008. After repayment of debt outstanding under OOMCs servicing advance facility totaling $986.2 million, OOMC realized
net cash proceeds of $212.5 million from WL Ross and $19.9 million previously held in escrow pursuant to the servicing advance facility, for a total of $232.4 million at closing. OOMC also retained a receivable relating to certain servicing assets of $117.4 million. At January 31, 2008 we had an impairment relating to the estimated loss upon disposition of OOMC equal to $304.9 million, including $193.4 million recorded in fiscal year 2007. OOMC incurred an actual loss upon sale of the servicing assets of $233.3 million. Impairments were reversed in the fourth quarter, resulting in net impairments for fiscal year 2008 totaling $39.9 million. As OOMC is a wholly-owned subsidiary, earnings and losses recognized at OOMC are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The sale is subject to certain post-closing adjustments.
