H&R Block Reports Fiscal 2009 Third Quarter Results
 
 
 
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today reported income from continuing operations for the fiscal 2009 third quarter ended Jan. 31, 2009, of $66.8 million, or $0.20 per share, up from income of $7.1 million, or $0.02 per share in the prior period. Third quarter revenues from continuing operations rose 11 percent to $993.4 million, compared with $894.8 million a year ago. This revenue increase reflects both growth in the number of tax returns prepared and higher net average tax preparation fees.

H&R Blocks fiscal third quarter results reflect significantly enhanced financial strength and improving profitability, said Richard C. Breeden, H&R Block Chairman. Continued cost reductions coupled with double digit top line revenue growth have expanded profits in our core business. Paying down more than $2.5 billion in debt has greatly improved our financial strength, which was one of our major goals for this year. While the fiscal fourth quarter is always the critical driver for H&R Blocks annual performance, we are nonetheless pleased with our results notwithstanding the headwinds in the broader economy added Mr. Breeden.
 
The company experienced a net loss of $19.5 million from discontinued operations for the quarter compared to a net loss of $54.4 million in the prior-year period. Discontinued operations for both periods include the results of H&R Block Financial Advisors, which was sold in November, 2008, while the year earlier period included losses, which did not recur in 2009, relating to the shutdown of mortgage lending operations.
 
Consolidated net income for the quarter was $47.4 million, or 14 cents per share. This was up from a consolidated net loss of $47.4 million, or 14 cents per share, in the prior year period.
 
For the nine months ended January 31, 2009, H&R Block reported a net loss from continuing operations of $194.8 million, or $0.59 per share, an improvement over a net loss of $240.0 million, or $0.74 per share, for the nine months ended January 31, 2008. Discontinued operations recorded a net loss of $26.5 million, or $0.08 per share for the nine months ended Jan. 31, 2009, down significantly from a year-ago loss of $612.2 million, or $1.89 per share, which reflected substantial losses associated with the former mortgage loan business. For the nine month period, consolidated net loss was $221.2 million, or $0.67 per share, compared with a net loss of $852.2 million, or $2.63 per share, for the same period in fiscal 2008. Nine month revenues were $1.62 billion in fiscal 2009 versus $1.55 billion in fiscal 2008.
 
Tax Services
 
Third quarter Tax Services revenues rose 15.1% year-over-year to $761.7 million. This increase reflects growth in tax returns prepared in U.S. retail offices of 1.6% compared with the year earlier period (excluding ESA filers during 2008), and an increase of 11.1% in retail net average fee per return. This increase in retail net average fee resulted from a combination of planned pricing increases, higher complexity of tax returns, a shift in client mix to higher AGI levels and lower discounts. However, part of the increase in revenues reflects the November, 2008 acquisition of a major franchisee in the Southwest. Excluding the effects of this acquisition, Tax Services revenues increased 10.6%.
 
The companys digital tax business, consisting of H&R Block Online tax filing products and TaxCut software, generated an increase of 100,000 tax returns prepared during the fiscal third quarter. This represented growth during the quarter of 6.7% in the total number of filings compared with the prior period. During the quarter H&R Block Online returns grew by 247,000, or 62%, compared with the same period in fiscal 2008. Among other things, this growth reflects the introduction this
 
2
year of a free online filing product and associated fee-bearing upgrades, which the company did not offer in 2008. The strong growth in online returns was partially offset by a small decline in software based returns and a larger decline in filings through the Free File Alliance as clients migrate to H&R Block Online offerings.
 
The Tax Services segment reported pretax income of $130.4 million for the quarter, up 184% from $45.9 million a year ago. Approximately $10 million of the increase in pretax income stemmed from an appreciable shift by clients to use of RACs rather than RALs. In addition to being less costly for clients, RACs do not involve revenue deferrals into the fourth quarter as is true with RALs. This timing difference in the recognition of RAC revenues compared with RALs should net out in the fiscal fourth quarter.
 
During the fiscal third quarter Tax Services expenses increased 2.5% compared with a 15.1% increase in revenues. This reflects in large part the net impact of the companys cost reduction initiatives, despite higher field variable compensation reflecting growth in return volumes and complexity, and greater marketing expense.
 
With our strong third quarter results, we remain on track to significantly improve the profitability of our businesses in FY09. We continue to see solid improvements in operating effectiveness and efficiency, said Russ Smyth, president and chief executive officer of H&R Block. Our positive third quarter results in both Tax Services and RSM McGladrey reflect good execution and strong focus on our core businesses. We are still at an early stage in our efforts to drive improved client satisfaction and quality, but I am encouraged at our opportunities in these areas as well, added Smyth.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2009, Tax Services revenues of $936.1 million were up 13.8% from $822.5 million in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date the pretax loss was $218.0 million, an improvement compared with a pretax loss of $325.6 million in the prior fiscal year period.
 
Interim Tax Results through Feb. 28 (excluding leap year and 2008 ESA only filings)
 
For the 2009 tax season through February 28, total tax returns prepared decreased 1.8% compared to tax season 2008. This reflects a decline in retail tax returns prepared of 3.9%, partially offset by a 4.0% increase in digital returns. For the 2009 tax season through February 28, tax preparation revenues, including digital, are up approximately $77 million, or 6.5%, over the comparable period in 2008. This reflects the impact of an increase of 8.5% in net average fees per retail return, offset partially by the lower number of total returns. The increase in these revenues also reflects the shift of more than 600 franchise offices to company ownership as a result of the Southwest acquisition.
 
This year we are seeing a number of changes in tax filings said Russ Smyth, Block CEO. While in 2009 we did not have the AMT issues experienced in 2008, the overall tax season started slower, in part due to the IRS beginning acceptance of efiling a week later in 2009 than last year. There was also a significant delay in the availability of Form 1099s, which delayed filings of more complex returns. H&R Block

has seen a decline in the number of returns showing adjusted gross incomes of less than $20,000, but an increase in expertise filings with AGI of more than $90,000, which involve materially higher preparation fees per customer. The economic stimulus of 2008 was delivered through tax return filings, while the initial phase of the 2009 economic stimulus for ordinary Americans is being delivered through changes in payroll tax withholding. We believe growth in total returns filed is below last year and that decline is pronounced in clients with the lowest incomes. At the same time we are definitely seeing a shift this year from assisted returns to digital filings, with particular popularity of free online filings. We have seen strong results in the second half of the tax season in each of the last three years, and we are working hard to match that performance again in 2009, Smyth added.
 
RSM McGladrey
 
Pretax income for the quarter at RSM McGladrey (Business Services segment) increased 62% to $10.7 million, compared to $6.6 million in fiscal 2008. Increased profitability reflected the effect of cost reduction initiatives on margins, as total revenues fell 3.5 % during the quarter compared to the prior year period. Core accounting, tax and consulting revenues increased $4.4 million, or 3%, over the prior-year period. Those gains were offset by a decline in capital markets revenues and lower sub-contractor revenues.
 
RSM revenues for the nine months ended January 31, 2009 were $592.9 million, down 5% from $623.8 million in the comparable period for the prior year. Pretax income for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was $23.5 million, up 42% compared with income of $16.5 million in the prior-year period.
 
H&R Block Bank
 
H&R Block Bank (Consumer Financial Services segment) reported a fiscal third quarter pretax loss of $3.3 million compared to pretax income of $12.3 million in the prior period. Income from the Emerald suite of products offered to tax clients increased during the period, but this was more than offset by a $13.5 million increase in loan loss reserves compared with the prior-year period. The bank continues to be affected by ongoing declines in housing values as well as higher delinquencies on mortgage loans owned by bank. The company expects to participate in the Obama Administrations recently-announced mortgage loan modification program, paralleling prior efforts to modify and restructure mortgage loans on owner-occupied properties.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2009, the Bank posted a pretax loss of $36.0 million, compared with pretax income of $12.8 million for the nine month period in fiscal 2008. This primarily reflects a $39.6 million increase in loan loss reserves, and a $5.7 million impairment of other real estate owned, during the current fiscal year period.

KEY OPERATING RESULTS

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The dilutive effect of potential common shares is included in diluted earnings per share, except in those periods with a loss from continuing operations.
Effective November 1, 2008, we sold HRB Financial Corporation, including our securities brokerage business formerly conducted through H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc. (HRBFA), to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. As a result of this transaction, we received cash proceeds, net of selling costs, of $304.0 million, plus repayment of net intercompany liabilities of $46.6 million. The carrying value of our investment in this business at the date of disposition was $293.7 million. We deferred recognition of a portion of the sale proceeds totaling $7.0 million, which represents the estimated value of an ongoing collaboration arrangement with our Tax Services businesses, and recorded a liability for indemnification obligations at an estimated fair value of $15.5 million. The transaction resulted in a capital loss for income tax purposes and, with the exception of benefits of approximately $10 million recorded during the quarter ended October 31, 2008, is not currently expected to result in a tax benefit. Net of selling expenses, deferrals, and indemnification liabilities, we recorded a loss during the quarter ended January 31, 2009 in connection with the disposition of this business totaling $12.2 million.
As of January 31, 2009, the results of operations of HRBFA and its direct corporate parent are presented as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements. All periods presented reflect our discontinued operations.
Discontinued operations also include mortgage businesses historically engaged in the origination of non-prime and prime mortgage loans, the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests, and the servicing of non-prime loans. During fiscal year 2008, we terminated all origination activities and sold the loan servicing operations. Also included in the prior year are the results of three smaller lines of business previously reported in our Business Services segment.
