H&R BLOCK REPORTS FISCAL 2009 RESULTS WITH EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.53 PER SHARE

For Immediate Release June 29, 2009
 
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today reported that income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2009, grew 15.0% to $513.1 million, or $1.53 per share, compared to $445.9 million, or $1.36 per share in the prior year. The growth in earnings per share came notwithstanding an increase of 2.2% in diluted shares outstanding, and after absorbing $0.11 per share in provisions for loan losses relating to the mortgage loan portfolio held by H&R Block Bank. 
 
Tax Services pretax income was $893.8 million, up 13.7% from $785.8 million in the prior year.  Pretax margin for the Tax Services segment improved 320 basis points over the prior year.  Business Services (RSM McGladrey) pretax income was $96.1 million, up 8.2% from $88.8 million during the prior year.  Pretax margins in Business Services rose 130 basis points over the prior year. 
 
Full year revenues were essentially flat at $4.1 billion.  Tax Services revenues grew 1.5% to $3.0 billion, compared to the prior period. Business Services revenues declined 4.7% to $897.8 million from $941.7 million in the prior period due to decreased performance in the Capital Markets business, and a change in reporting relating to accounting for leased employees.  Core Tax and Consulting revenues grew 4.1% in 2009.

During the past year H&R Block significantly improved earnings and profit margins despite the overall economy.  We increased net worth by $418.0 million, or 42.3%.  A positive swing of $1 billion moved us from a net debt position to a net cash balance sheet at the end of our fiscal year for the first time in four years, said Richard C. Breeden, H&R Block Chairman.  In addition to bringing in Russ Smyth as CEO last August, we recently restructured our tax management to flatten the structure, promote accountability and drive greater innovation and flexibility in retail operations, added Mr. Breeden.  We believe our greatly enhanced financial strength and new management will allow us to achieve significant improvements in both products and client service for the future as well as to achieve further cost reductions, said Mr. Breeden. 
 
Consolidated net income for fiscal 2009 was $485.7 million, or $1.45 per share.  This compares to a prior-year loss of $308.6 million, or $(0.94) per share. 
 
Tax Services
 
Total tax returns prepared in U.S. company-owned offices declined 2.8%, while net average fee per tax return in company-owned offices increased 6.8%.  Overall, U.S. retail tax returns prepared fell 5.8% while the net average retail fee per return prepared increased 7.2%.  The increase in retail net average fee resulted primarily from the effects of a higher complexity of tax returns and a continuing growth among clients with higher adjusted gross income levels. 
 
Tax returns prepared using H&R Block Online tax products and TaxCut software increased in fiscal 2009 by more than 900,000, or 21.1%.  Returns prepared online grew 45.2% and software-prepared returns increased 1.7%.  The substantial online growth reflects H&R Blocks introduction this year of new products, including a free federal online filing product and associated fee-bearing upgrades, including state tax returns.  Returns prepared through the IRS Free File Alliance (FFA) declined by 665,000, or 45.8%, as clients migrated to H&R Block Online offerings.  Total returns prepared by H&R Blocks digital tax solutions, including FFA, increased 4.2%.
 
We achieved ambitious targets for earnings in our tax business in fiscal 2009, and demonstrated we could win market share in the critical digital and online segment of the market. While our retail customer decline was not acceptable, we believe that we have identified a set of initiatives that can significantly improve the overall client experience.  We are determined to improve our brand position among clients across the income spectrum, and to drive quality in everything we do. Notwithstanding the challenges last year, we see significant opportunities in the coming years to transform our client service culture, said Russ Smyth, president and CEO.

RSM McGladrey
 
RSM McGladrey (Business Services) reported an 8.2% improvement in fiscal 2009 pretax income to $96.1 million, despite revenues declining 4.7% to $897.8 million.  RSM McGladreys margin improved to 10.7% from 9.4% in the prior year, reflecting growth in its core businesses and the benefit of cost reduction efforts. 
 
Revenues for the segments core tax and consulting services were up 3.6% and 5.2%, respectively, for a combined increase of $28.2 million, driven in part by higher billed rates per hour in tax.  Those gains were offset by a $32.9 million decline in capital markets revenues, and by lower contract services revenues and a change in financial reporting.  Amounts reported in previous years as leased-employee revenue have been eliminated in the current year. However, this reporting change did not affect earnings as related costs were also eliminated.     
 
H&R Block Bank
 
H&R Block Bank (Consumer Financial Services) reported a pretax loss of $14.5 million for the fiscal year 2009, compared to pretax income of $11.5 million in the prior year.  The Emerald suite of products offered to tax clients posted pretax income of approximately $70 million, compared to approximately $10 million in the prior year.  During fiscal 2009 the Bank issued more than 2.9 million H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCards and funded $720 million in Emerald Advance lines of credit.
 
The Company recorded $63.9 million in loan loss provisions during the year, and an $11.9 million write-down of real estate owned.  The Bank experienced a decline of $28.5 million in mortgage loan interest income, reflecting the continuing planned runoff of the aggregate portfolio as well as loan delinquencies.  The Banks total mortgage loan portfolio net of reserves was $966.3 million at April 30, 2008, and was reduced by $221.4 million to $744.9 million at April 30, 2009.     
 
Outlook
 
The Company expects fiscal 2010 earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.80 per share.  
 
Moving forward, we are repositioning our core tax business for renewed and sustainable growth, while continuing to take excessive costs out of the retail structure.  We have recently changed advertising firms, and plan new and more effective marketing efforts during the coming year.  We also plan other steps designed to do a better job of attracting and retaining tax clients, and significantly improving the overall client experience, said Russ Smyth.  At the same time, we believe we have significant opportunities to continue to grow our digital business.  We will improve our digital products for next year, and better integrate digital and retail operations and products.  We believe we can create a more seamless operation capable of serving our clients the way they want to be served, added Smyth.
