KANSAS CITY, Mo.
 
Since joining the company in 2001, Shulman has been instrumental in building H&R Blocks strong financial position, particularly in the last few years as CFO.  I want to thank Becky for the critical role she has played during a time of significant transition. Our company is in a very strong financial position today, in large part due to Beckys leadership.  She will be missed, said Russ Smyth, H&R Blocks president and chief executive officer.
H&R Block has retained Crist|KolderAssociates to lead the search.
