If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of Block, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons shall not be considered to cause a change in the ownership of the corporation.  An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in whi ch Block acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this Section 3 (i)(i)(A)

Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of Block possessing 35 percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of Block.  If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control a corporation within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(vi), the acquisition of additional control of the corporation by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the effective control of the corporation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you give written notice of termination as the result of Good Reason and the Company fails to cure such Good Reason within 30 days of such notice, your termination will be effective at the end of such 30-day cure period.  If a written notice of termination is provided by either you or the Company, the Company may, in its sole discretion, relieve you of your duties, responsibilities and title during the period prior to your termination date; provided, however, that during such period you shall remain an employee of the Company with the same compensation and benefit arrangements as in place immediately prior to delivery of the termination notice.

(k)
 
.  If Block is required to restate its financial results due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws as a result of misconduct or error (as determined by the Audit Committee or by the full Board), the Company, Block or any Affiliate may, in the discretion of the Committee, take action to recoup from you all or any portion of any bonuses, other incentive-based or equity-based compensation, and profits realized from the sale of Shares (each such amounts shall be referred to as an "Award") received by you, the amount of which had been determined in whole or in part upon performance goals re lating to the restated financial results, or upon the Fair Market Value of Shares, regardless of whether you engaged in any misconduct or were at fault or responsible in any way for causing the need for the restatement. In such an event, the Company, Block or any Affiliate shall be entitled to recoup up to the amount, if any, by which the Award, or the Fair Market Value of the Shares, actually received by you exceeded the payment or Fair Market Value, as applicable, that would have been received based on the restated financial results, and any profits from the sale of Shares transferred pursuant to an Award in excess of the profits that would have been received based on the restated financial results. The Companys, Block's and each Affiliate's right of recoupment shall apply only if demand for recoupment is made not later than three years following the payment of the applicable Award.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you shall reimburse the Company, Block or an Affiliate for bonuse s, other incentive-based or equity-based compensation, and profits realized from the sale of Shares as required by applicable law, including Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.

  It is intended that this Agreement will comply with Section 409A of the Code and any regulations and guidelines promulgated thereunder (collectively, Section 409A), to the extent the Agreement is subject thereto, and the Agreement shall be interpreted on a basis consistent with such intent.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if you are deemed on the date of your separation from service (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)) with the Company to be a specified employee (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(i)) , then with regard to any payment or benefit that is considered deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a separation from service that is required to be delayed pursuant to Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code (after taking into account any applicable exceptions to such requirement), such payment or benefit shall be made or provided on the date that is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of your separation from service, or (ii) the date of your death (the Delay Period).  Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 7(n) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to you in a lump sum and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herei n.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A, references to your termination of employment (and corollary terms) with the Company shall be construed to refer to your separation from service (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)) with the Company.  With respect to any reimbursement or in-kind benefit arrangements of the Company and its Affiliates that constitute deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A, except as otherwise permitted by Section 409A, the following conditions shall be applicable: (i) the amount eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, under any such arrangement in one calendar year may not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provid ed, under such arrangement in any other calendar year (except that the health and dental plans may impose a limit on the amount that may be reimbursed or paid), (ii) any reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred, and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  Whenever payments under this Agreement are to be made in installments, each such installment shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any tax gross-up payment (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v)) provided for in this Agreement shall be made to you no later than the end of your taxable year next following your taxable year in which you remit the related taxes.

Excise Tax
 
(i)
 
.  In the event that a Change in Control occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Employment Date and it is determined that any payment, award, benefit or distribution (including, without limitation, the acceleration of any payment, award, distribution or benefit), by the Company, Block or any of their Affiliates to or for your benefit (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section) (a Payment) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any corresponding provisions of state or loc al excise tax law, or any interest or penalties are incurred by you with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax), then you shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a Gross-Up Payment) in an amount such that after payment by you of all taxes (including any Excise Tax, income tax or employment tax) imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes, you retain from the Gross-Up Payment an amount equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.  Any Gross-Up Payment shall be paid to you (or for your benefit to the extent of the Companys withholding obligation with respect to applicable taxes) no later than the due date for the payment of the Excise Tax.  For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, you shall be deemed to pay federal income tax and employment taxes at t he highest marginal rate of federal income and employment taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in any state and locality to which you are subject to income tax on the date the Gross-Up Payment is made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes that may be obtained from the deduction of state and local taxes.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(o)(i), if it is determined that you are entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the portion of the Payments that would be treated as parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code does not exceed by more than $100,000 the greatest amount (the Safe Harbor Amount) that could be paid to you such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax, then the amount payable under Section 4(d) of this Agreement shall be reduced (but not in excess of $100,000) so that the Payments, in the aggregate, are reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount and no Excise Tax is payable by you.  For the avoidance of doubt, only payments under Section 4(d) will be subject to reduction under this Section 7(o)(i), and if the reduction of any such payments by up to $100,000 would not eliminate the Excise Tax, then no such reduction will be made and you will be entitled to the Gross-Up Payment.
Gross-Up Payment
 
(ii)
 
.  In the event that a Change in Control occurs on or after the first anniversary of the Employment Date, to the extent that any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay or provide to you the greatest of the following, whichever gives you the highest net after-tax amount (after taking into account federal, state, local and social security taxes at the maximum marginal rates and the Excise Tax): (1) all of the Payments or (2) Payments not in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount.  The Payments to be reduced hereunder, if any, will be determined in a manner which has the least economic cost t o you and, to the extent the economic cost is equivalent, will be reduced in the inverse order of when the Payment would have been made to you until the reduction specified herein is achieved.
Contingent Cutback
 
(iii)
 
.  All determinations required to be made under this Section 7(o) shall be made by a certified public accounting firm or executive compensation consulting firm, in either case of national standing (a ) as mutually agreed to by the Company and you (or, if the Company and you cannot reach such mutual agreement, each shall select a Qualified Firm and such Qualified Firms shall mutually select a third Qualified Firm) and such selected Qualified Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and you within 15 business d ays of the receipt of notice from you that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  All fees and expenses of the Qualified Firm selected by the Company (and the third Qualified Firm if one is required to be selected) shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any determination by the Qualified Firm shall be binding upon the Company and you.  You shall cooperate, to the extent your reasonable out-of pocket expenses are reimbursed by the Company, with any reasonable requests by the Company in connection with any contests or disputes with the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the Excise Tax.
