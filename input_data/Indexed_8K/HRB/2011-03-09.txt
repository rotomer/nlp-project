Tax season to-date results through Feb. 28
Fiscal Third Quarter results ended Jan. 31
For Immediate Release March 9, 2011
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today released interim tax season results through Feb. 28, 2011.  Total tax returns prepared through Feb. 28 grew 6.0 percent compared to the prior year.  Total retail returns prepared increased 3.2 percent for the period, contrasted with losses in the comparable periods in each of last several years. Total digital tax returns increased 12.7 percent, including a 30.2 percent increase in online filings.  
Through Feb. 28, the companys efforts to promote early season filings led to retail new client growth of 25 percent.
After a slow start to the tax season the company has seen significant growth in returns prepared and tax preparation revenues during February.  On a comparable day-to-day basis, total retail returns prepared increased 17.2 percent in February and online filings increased 36.7 percent.

 We are now more than half-way through the tax season and I am very pleased with our execution to date, said Alan Bennett, H&R Blocks president and chief executive officer. Despite the competitive disadvantage of not being able to offer RALs, we believe we gained share in both retail and online within the highly competitive early-season.  Clearly understood goals and objectives, a focused and compelling marketing message, and strong execution throughout our organization led to solid growth in returns prepared, added Bennett.
   
Increased website traffic and improved conversion rates continued to drive strong growth in the companys online business, including new online client growth of 49 percent.  Strong season-to-date growth in online filings was partially offset by a 0.9 percent decline in software-based returns and a 12.8 percent decline in Free File Alliance (FFA).  Total digital tax returns, including online, software and FFA, increased 12.7 percent through Feb. 28, while total digital returns excluding FFA increased 16.7 percent.
As expected, retail tax preparation revenues grew by 14.0 percent on a comparable day-to-day basis from Feb. 15 to Feb. 28, led by strong growth in retail returns prepared and an improvement in the retail net average charge (NAC).   Retail tax preparation revenues year-to-date through Feb. 28 fell $66.4 million, or 4.1 percent compared to the prior year period.  This reflects a 3.2 percent increase in retail returns prepared, which was more than offset by a 7.1 percent decline in the NAC.
The decline in NAC to date is attributable primarily to strong new client growth, in particular growth resulting from this years free federal 1040 EZ offer.  Declines in NAC through Feb. 28 were also impacted by the IRS inability to process more complex returns prior to Feb. 14 and the loss of some RAL clients whose returns typically contain more complex tax credits.  Excluding 1040 EZ returns and fees, the adjusted NAC increased 2.7 percent versus the prior year.
The company expects its NAC will increase throughout the remainder of the tax season.  Due to the strong success of its early-season EZ promotion, the company anticipates its full-year NAC will decline approximately 2 to 4 percentage points compared to the prior year.  The company also expects that expiration of the EZ promotion effective Feb. 28 will result in moderation in new retail client growth, and estimates that total retail returns prepared in 2011 will increase approximately 0.5 to 1.5 percent compared to the prior year.
Fiscal Third Quarter Results
The company reported a net loss from continuing operations in the current quarter of $4.4 million, or $0.01 per share.  Third quarter revenues declined 8.9 percent to $851.5 million.  Adjusted (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations for the fiscal third quarter ended Jan. 31, 2011, was $44.0 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to $54.6 million, or $0.16 per share in the prior-year period.  As previously announced on Feb. 23, the company deferred $19.7 million ($11.9 million after-tax) of revenue to its fiscal fourth quarter due to an IRS delay in accepting certain forms prior to Feb. 14.  In addition, the company incurred after-tax charges of $36.5 million principally related to goodwill impairment at its RedGear reporting unit, incremental credit losses on its Emerald Advance line of credit , and costs of litigation.

Tax Services
Total segment revenues for the third quarter ended Jan. 31, fell 10.0 percent year-over-year to $672.8 million, reflecting a 5.8 percent decline in total retail tax returns prepared and a 5.9 percent decline in the retail NAC per tax return prepared through Jan. 31, 2011.  An industry-wide slow start to the tax season and the aforementioned charges resulted in a decline in third-quarter pretax income to $4.1 million compared with pretax income of $131.2 million a year ago.
Nine-month segment revenues were $875.4 million, down 7.4 percent from
$945.0 million in last years period.  The pretax loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $324.9 million, compared to a loss of $213.0 million in the prior-year period.

Total expenses fell $27.0 million, or 14.2 percent, primarily due to a $15.0 million impairment of goodwill and litigation costs incurred in the prior year period.
fell 4.0 percent year
Nine-month segment revenues were $549.4 million, down 2.4 percent from
$562.7 million in last years period.  Pretax income for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $16.6 million, compared to a loss of $9.7 million in the prior-year period.
Corporate
Corporate includes support department costs, such as finance and legal, as well as net interest margin and other gains/losses associated with H&R Block Banks mortgage portfolio. Corporate pretax losses of $30.2 million for the third quarter ended Jan. 31, 2011, compared to a loss of $22.5 million in the prior year. The higher loss was primarily due to a one-time gain of $9.5 million recorded in the prior year on the transfer of liabilities relating to previously retained insurance risk to a third-party.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2011, a pretax loss of $91.6 million compares with a loss of $103.6 million in the year-ago period.
Net mortgage loans held for investment declined 20 percent from $641.2 million at Jan. 31, 2010 to $513.2 million at Jan. 31, 2011.  Third quarter loss provisions on mortgage loans totaled $7.8 million, down $1.3 million compared with the prior year quarter.  The loan loss allowance was $87.9 million, or 14.7 percent of outstanding principal at Jan. 31, 2011 compared to $97.3 million or 13.3 percent at Jan. 31, 2010.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2011, loss provisions on mortgage loans totaled $24.1 million, a decline of $12.0 million compared with the prior year period.   Lower losses are primarily due to a combination of declining delinquency rates and stabilizing home prices.

Discontinued Operations
Sand Canyon Corporation (SCC, previously known as Option One Mortgage Corporation) ceased originating mortgage loans in December 2007 and, in April 2008, sold its servicing assets and discontinued its remaining operations.
Sand Canyon entered the third quarter ended Jan. 31, 2011 with unresolved claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the principal amount of $121 million.  In addition, new claims for alleged breaches in the principal amount of $33 million were received during the third quarter.  With the exception of $14 million of unresolved claims, all claims were reviewed, with incurred losses totaling $4.3 million.
As expected, SCC made payments during the quarter of $25.4 million for previously reserved losses under an indemnification agreement dated April 2008.  The indemnification agreement was entered into with a specific counterparty in exchange for a full and complete release of such partys ability to assert representation and warranty claims. The remaining obligation of $24.2 million under this agreement was paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
 
From May 1, 2008 through Jan. 31, 2011, SCC has received cumulative repurchase claims totaling $740 million in unpaid principal.  Losses on loan repurchase, indemnification and settlement payments totaled approximately $88 million during this period.   At Jan. 31, 2011, SCCs reserve for estimated losses on contingent mortgage loan repurchase obligations, inclusive of the aforementioned $24.2 million indemnification obligation, totaled $155 million.  Claim activity and associated losses remain within SCCs reserved expectations.
