H&R BLOCK REPORTS FISCAL 2011 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS
 
For Immediate Release June 23, 2011
 
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today reported net income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2011 of $419.4 million, or $1.35 per share.  In addition to previously announced charges, the companys Business Services segment incurred an after-tax litigation charge in the fourth quarter of $17.0 million, or $0.06 per share.  Adjusted (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 was $470.6 million, essentially flat to adjusted net income in the prior year.  Adjusted earnings per share increased 7 percent to $1.52 due to a decline in weighted average shares outstanding. Total revenues of $3.8 billion were down 2.6 percent compared to the prior year.
 
The actions taken this year have strengthened important fundamentals in our business, said William C. Cobb, H&R Blocks president and chief executive officer. We achieved our highest level of U.S. client growth since 2001 and maintained strong earnings results despite a number of special items. We also reversed years of market share declines and have built a solid pipeline of new and younger clients.  All of this positions us well for the future.
Tax Services
The segment reported fiscal 2011 pretax income of $767.5 million.  Adjusting for special items, the segments pretax income was $829.9 million, essentially flat to the prior year.  Adjusted pretax margin for the segment improved to 28.5 percent, compared with adjusted pretax margin of 27.9 percent in the prior year, as a result of cost savings achieved through reductions in force and the office network.
All per share amounts are based on fully diluted shares

Total online returns prepared exclude software-based and Free File Alliance (FFA) returns.

 Fiscal 2011 segment revenues declined 2.1 percent to $2.9 billion. This decline was primarily attributable to the strategic sale of 280 company owned locations to franchisees, as well as lower revenues stemming from the companys inability to offer refund anticipation loans this tax season.
   
Total U.S. tax returns prepared by H&R Block in fiscal 2011 grew 6.5 percent, or 1.3 million returns.  Total retail returns prepared grew 3.6 percent, while the net average retail fee per tax return prepared declined 3.3 percent.  Total digital tax returns prepared increased 13.5 percent, led by growth of 28.7 percent in online filings.

In tax season 2011, the company believes total industry-wide filings at the IRS increased by 1.1 percent to approximately 131 million returns.  The company estimates it gained 80 basis points of total U.S. market share in tax season 2011, including 60 basis points of share in retail and 90 basis points in the digital online category.
The significant improvement in many of our key client satisfaction indicators gives us confidence that we can attract more clients to our brand, retain clients at higher rates, and continue driving organic growth in our business, said Cobb.
