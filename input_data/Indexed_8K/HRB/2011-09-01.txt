The company recorded after-tax charges of $62.2 million, or $0.20 per share, largely related to the pending sale of its RSM McGladrey (RSM) subsidiaryadjusted net loss from continuing operations of $111.2 million was essentially flat to the prior year.  The adjusted loss per share increased to $0.37 compared to a loss of $0.35 per share a year ago due to fewer shares outstanding.  Total revenues fell 2.5 percent to $267.6 million due to declining revenues at RSM.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     Basic earnings per share is computed using the two-class method and is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding.  The dilutive effect of potential common shares is included in diluted earnings per share, except in those periods with a loss from continuing operations.
     In August 2011, we signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell substantially all assets of RSM McGladrey Business Services, Inc (RSM) to McGladrey & Pullen LLP (M&P) and began an evaluation of strategic alternatives for RSM EquiCo, Inc. (RSM EquiCo). The RSM sale is dependent on, among other factors, the ability of M&P to raise financing for the purchase. We recorded a $99.7 million impairment of goodwill in the first quarter for reporting units in our Business Services segment based on these events. This loss was offset partially by the sale of an ancillary business within the Business Services segment during the quarter which resulted in a $9.9 million gain. On an after-tax basis, the net result of these events is a charge of $53.2 million, or $0.17 per share. These amounts related to the sale of RSM may fluctuate based on adjustments to the purchase price at closing as well as the additional realization of tax benefits related to the sale.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, we believe certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide additional meaningful comparisons between current year results and prior periods. Reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are provided below. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not as an alternative for, our reported GAAP results.
