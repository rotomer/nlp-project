(Sub), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, 2SS, TA Associates Management, L.P. in its capacity as a stockholder representative, and Lance Dunn in his capacity as a stockholder representative, pursuant to which Sub would have merged with and into 2SS (the Merger), with 2SS continuing as the surviving corporation and an indirect subsidiary of the Company after the Merger.
A description of the terms of the Merger Agreement was included in Item 1.01 of the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 14, 2010 and March 9, 2011 and in Item 9B of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 23, 2011 and, to the extent required by Item 1.02 of Form 8-K, such descriptions are incorporated by reference in this Item 1.02 pursuant to General Instruction B.3 of Form 8-K.

On November 14, 2011, the Company, 2SS,  TA Associates Management, L.P. in its capacity as a stockholder representative, and Lance Dunn in his capacity as a stockholder representative, mutually agreed to a termination of the Merger Agreement.
The Company is not expected to incur any early termination penalties as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement.
