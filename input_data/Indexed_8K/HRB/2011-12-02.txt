H&R Block Reports Fiscal 2012 Second Quarter Results; Closes Sale of RSM McGladrey
For Immediate Release: Dec. 1, 2011
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today reported a GAAP net loss from continuing operations for the fiscal second quarter ended Oct. 31, 2011, of $123.0 million, or $0.41 per share, compared to a net loss of $111.4 million, or $0.36 per share in the prior year period.  Results for the quarter include net after-tax charges of $8.0 million, or $0.03 per share, primarily due to the previously announced discontinuation of its ExpressTax business, as well as increased litigation costs in Tax Servicesadjusted non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $115.0 million was essentially flat to the adjusted loss in the prior year.  Total revenues increased 8 percent to $129.2 million, due primarily to results from the companys Australian tax operations.

As we shift to focusing our efforts on growing clients and market share in our core tax business, we're disposing of non-core assets, such as RSM McGladrey and ExpressTax," said Bill Cobb, H&R Block's president and CEO. While these moves have led to one-time charges in each of the past two quarters, they've also helped clear the decks for long-term earnings growth and improved margins. As next tax season approaches, we believe we're on the right path for continued market share gains.
For the six months ended Oct. 31, 2011, H&R Block reported a net loss from continuing operations of $242.2 million, or $0.80 per share, compared with a loss of $239.3 million, or $0.77 cents per share in the prior year period.  Six-month revenues increased 4.7 percent to $229.8 million.

Sale of RSM McGladrey
On Nov. 30, 2011, H&R Block completed the sale of RSM McGladrey (RSM) to McGladrey & Pullen, LLP (M&P). H&R Block will receive total proceeds of approximately $575 million, which includes closing cash proceeds of $487 million (including $12 million of cash on RSMs closing balance sheet), a note in the principal amount of $54 million, and approximately $34 million of cash which H&R Block expects to receive by calendar-year end.  Proceeds are subject to further post-closing adjustments.  M&P assumed substantially all liabilities of the RSM business, including contingent payments and lease obligations.
The final terms and conditions are consistent to those previously announced on Aug. 23, 2011.  Differences from the previously announced purchase price of $610 million are the result of cash of approximately $35 million transferred by RSM to H&R Block prior to closing.  In addition, the sale will trigger account distributions of approximately $80 million to RSM employees who were participants in an H&R Block sponsored deferred compensation plan.
"This sale is an important step toward refocusing the company on growing clients and market share in our core tax business and improving our margins, said Mr. Cobb. "For twelve years, our friends at McGladrey have been our partners and shared in the journey with H&R Block. I'm confident that the outstanding professionals at McGladrey will prosper in the years ahead.
H&R Block acquired RSM in 1999. Today, RSM employs nearly 6,500 associates and professionals in more than 70 offices nationwide. BofA Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisor and Husch Blackwell LLP acted as legal advisor for H&R Block.
Beginning in the second quarter, RSMs results are now being reported in discontinued operations.
Second Quarter Segment Results
Tax Services
Second quarter Tax Services revenues grew 9.1 percent to $121.0 million, primarily driven by results in the companys international tax operations. The segment reported a pretax loss of $174.0 million, compared to a loss of $154.4 million a year ago.  The higher loss was primarily due to an $8 million increase in litigation costs and previously announced charges of approximately $9 million in connection with the discontinuation of ExpressTax.
Six-month segment revenues increased 4.9 percent to $212.4 million.  The pretax loss for the first six months of fiscal 2012 increased to $343.4 million, compared to a loss of $329.0 million in the prior-year period, due primarily to litigation and impairment charges.

portfolio. Corporate reported a pretax loss of $30.0 million for the second quarter ended October 31, 2011, compared to a loss of $29.2 million in the prior year.  For the first six months of fiscal 2012, a pretax loss of $61.1 million was essentially flat to the prior year loss of $61.7 million.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
Discontinued operations includes the results of RSM and Sand Canyon Corporation (SCC), formerly known as Option One Mortgage Corporation.  SCC ceased originating mortgage loans in December 2007 and, in April 2008, sold its servicing assets and discontinued its remaining operations. 
Discontinued operations reported a second quarter net loss of $18.7 million compared to net income of $2.4 million in the prior-year period.  SCC recorded a $20 million pretax provision for estimated losses on contingent loan repurchase obligations during the quarter, in connection with increased third-party activity.  For the first six months of fiscal 2012, the net loss in discontinued obligations increased to $74.7 million, or $0.25 per share, largely due to a first quarter impairment charge which stemmed from the sale of RSM.
During the second quarter, SCC received new claims for alleged breaches of representation and warranties in the principal amount of $483 million.  SCC reviewed $61 million of claims during the quarter, with incurred losses totaling $3 million.  At Oct. 31, 2011, total claims of $537 million remain subject to review.
 
 We believe SCCs decision to increase its reserve is prudent in light of second quarter activity, said Mr. Cobb.  SCC has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block.  We believe SCCs financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims.
 
At quarter end, SCC had net equity of approximately $287 million, in addition to an accrual for representation and warranty liabilities of $143 million.
 
Share Repurchases
 
During the second quarter, H&R Block repurchased and retired 4.3 percent of its outstanding shares at a total cost of $177.5 million, or an average purchase price of $13.61 per share.  At Oct. 31, 2011, 292.9 million shares were outstanding.  Approximately $1.2 billion remains under the companys existing share repurchase authorization.
 
Im very pleased that we were able to take advantage of the market volatility this past quarter to repurchase more than 13 million shares.  We remain fully committed to returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase, said Mr. Cobb.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Basic earnings per share is computed using the two-class method and is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding.  The dilutive effect of potential common shares is included in diluted earnings per share, except in those periods with a loss from continuing operations.
In August 2011, our Board of Directors approved a non-binding letter of intent to sell substantially all assets of RSM McGladrey, Inc. (RSM) to McGladrey and Pullen LLP (M&P) and, on November 30, 2011, the sale of RSM was completed. At closing we received cash proceeds totaling $475.0 million, a short-term receivable of $34.0 million and a note in the principal amount of $54.0 million. The final purchase price is subject to further post-closing adjustments. M&P also assumed substantially all liabilities of RSM, including contingent payments and lease obligations. We have indemnified M&P for certain litigation matters and certain obligations related primarily to previously sold RSM subsidiaries. In the first quarter we recorded an $85.4 million impairment of goodwill in connection with the sale of RSM. The net loss ultimately resulting from the divestiture of RSM will be based on post-closing adjustments to the purchase price, as well as the additional realization of tax benefits related to the sale. In the first quarter, we also announced we were evaluating strategic alternatives for RSM EquiCo, Inc. (EquiCo), and recorded a $14.3 million impairment of goodwill related to this business.
As of October 31, 2011, these businesses are presented as discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities of the businesses being sold are presented as held-for-sale in the condensed consolidated financial statements. All periods presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations have been reclassified to reflect our discontinued operations.
