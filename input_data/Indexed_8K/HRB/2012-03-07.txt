Interim tax results through Feb. 28
Fiscal third quarter results ended Jan. 31
For Immediate Release March 7, 2012
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB) today released interim period U.S. tax results through Feb. 28, 2012.  Total U.S. tax returns prepared fiscal year-to-date through Feb. 28 grew 5.1 percent compared to the prior year.  Total retail returns prepared increased 1.6 percent for the comparable period. Total digital tax returns increased 12.6 percent, including a 20.4 percent increase in online filings.
With the first half of the tax season now behind us, I am pleased by the 5 percent growth in U.S. tax returns prepared to date, said Bill Cobb, H&R Blocks president and chief executive officer. We continue to work to position the company for long-term growth in revenue and earnings.

The company also reported fiscal third quarter results ended Jan. 31, 2012.  The company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $3.6 million, or $0.01 per share for the quarter, compared to a loss of $11.0 million, or $0.04 per share in the prior year period.  Total revenues fell 2.5 percent to $663.3 million.

For the nine months ended Jan. 31, 2012, the company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $245.7 million, or $0.82 per share, compared with a prior year loss of $250.3 million, or $0.80 cents per share.  Nine-month revenues fell 0.7 percent to $893.1 million.
Due to the seasonality of its Tax Services business segment, the company normally reports an operating loss for
the first nine months of its fiscal year.  
Tax Services
Total segment revenues for the third quarter ended Jan. 31, declined 2.5 percent year-over-year to $655.7 million.  Tax preparation and related revenues through Jan. 31 increased 10.0 percent, or $48.5 million, due to growth in total tax returns prepared.
Higher tax preparation revenues were offset by a decline in financial product revenues.  In line with the companys continued focus on attracting and retaining clients through value offerings, refund anticipation checks (RACs) were offered free to clients electing to deposit their refund on an H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard.  This promotion, which expired on Feb. 4, resulted in a significant increase in Emerald Card units from tax preparation clients through Jan. 31, but a decline of $30.3 million in quarterly RAC revenues.  The company also changed its underwriting criteria for its Emerald Advance program in fiscal 2012.  While this change led to a $16.1 million decline in interest income, associated credit losses fell by $36.6 million compared to the prior year.  Prior year results also included $16.3 million of non-recurring revenue from a terminated RAL contract.
The segments pretax income increased to $31.7 million, compared to income of $4.1 million a year ago.  This improvement was primarily due to the lower credit losses and a decline in impairment and litigation related charges, partially offset by increased marketing expense and the decline in revenues.
Nine-month segment revenues fell 0.8 percent to $868.1 million.  The pretax loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $311.7 million, compared to a loss of $324.9 million in the prior-year period.
Corporate
Corporate includes support department costs, such as finance and legal, as well as net interest margin and other gains/losses associated with H&R Block Banks mortgage portfolio. Third quarter corporate revenues of $7.6 million were essentially flat to the prior year.  The segments pretax loss of $32.7 million for the third quarter ended Jan. 31, 2012, compared to a loss of $30.1 million in the prior year.
Nine-month corporate revenues grew 2.5 percent to $25.0 million.  The pretax loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $93.8 million, compared to a loss of $91.8 million in the prior-year period.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
Discontinued operations includes the results of RSM McGladrey (RSM) and Sand Canyon Corporation, formerly known as Option One Mortgage Corporation, and its subsidiaries (SCC).

During the third quarter, SCC received new claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the principal amount of $35 million.  SCC completed a review of prior period claims with an approximate principal balance of $220 million. Claims found to be valid in the third quarter have estimated losses totaling $1.2 million.  As payments related to these valid claims remained pending at Jan. 31, SCCs accrual for representation and warranty liabilities remained unchanged from the prior quarter at $143 million.  At Jan. 31, total claims of $399 million remain subject to review.
 
Discontinued operations reported third quarter net income of $0.2 million compared to a net loss of $1.7 million in the prior-year period.  For the first nine months of fiscal 2012, the net loss in discontinued operations increased to $74.4 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to a loss of $2.2 million, or $0.01 per share in the prior year period.  The increase fiscal year-to-date is primarily due to the net loss of $37.1 million on the sale of RSM and increased loss provisions for litigation and representation and warranty claims.
Committed Line of Credit (CLOC)
The company also announced today an amendment of its CLOC that reduced its minimum equity covenant by $150 million to $500 million.  The company expects to refinance the CLOC, which expires in July 2013, during fiscal year 2013.
Dividend
