If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of H&R Block, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons shall not be considered to cause a Change of Control.  An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which H&R Block acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this Section 1.3(a).

If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control a corporation within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(5)(vi), the acquisition of additional control of the corporation by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the effective control of the corporation.

(d)           Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from H&R Block that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 50 percent of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of H&R Block immediately before such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of H&R Block, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no Change of Control event under this Section 1.3(d) when there is a transfer to an entity that is controlled by the shareholders of H&R Block immediately after the transfer. A transfer of assets by H&R Block is not treated as a change in the ownership of such assets if the assets are transferred to:  (i) a shareholder of H&R Block (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock; (ii) an entity, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by H&R Block; (iii) a person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of H&R Block; or (iv) an entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in (iii) above.

An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which H&R Block acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this Section 1.2(a).
 
(b)           Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of H&R Block possessing 35 percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of H&R Block.

The Pre-Tax Earnings Percentage is based on achievement of Target with respect to Cumulative Three Year Pre-Tax Earnings as determined under the following table:
Payment Formula

Grant Agreement  Performance Share Units (2012)

For Cumulative Three Year Pre-Tax Earnings below Threshold Performance, the Earned Percentage shall be zero percent (0%).  For Cumulative Three Year Pre-Tax Earnings between Threshold and Target, the Earned Percentage shall be interpolated between zero percent (0%) and one hundred percent (100%).  For levels of Cumulative Three Year Pre-Tax Earnings between Target and Maximum, the Earned Percentage shall be interpolated between one hundred percent (100%) and two hundred percent (200%).  For Cumulative Three Year Pre-Tax Earnings in excess of Maximum, the Earned Percentage shall be two hundred percent (200%).
 
The Relative TSR Factor will be 75% if Relative TSR is at or below the 20th percentile.  The Relative TSR Factor will be 125% if the Relative TSR is at or above the 80th percentile.  Relative TSR between the 20th and 80th percentiles results in a Relative TSR Factor between 75% and 125%, based on straight line interpolation between the 20th and 80th percentiles.
 
2.6           .  Except as otherwise provided in this Grant Agreement, Participant shall become vested in the Performance Share Units only if Participant remains continuously employed by the Company throughout the Performance Period, and the Participants Termination of Employment before the end of the Performance Period shall result in forfeiture of all rights in the Performance Share Units and Participant shall not be entitled to a distribution of any shares of Common Stock related to such forfeited Performance Share Units.
Vesting
 
2.7           .  Notwithstanding Section 2.6, and subject to Section 2.5, the Participant shall be entitled to pro-rata vesting of the Performance Share Units on the occurrence of any of the following events; provided that receipt of the benefits set forth in this Section 2.7 may be conditioned on the Participant executing and not revoking a release and separation agreement (and the deadline for executing and not revoking such agreement shall not delay the payment date of the shares to be issued pursuant to the vesting of the Performance Share Units).  The pro-rata vesting of the Performance Share Units shall be based on the period between the first day of the Performance Period and the Participants Last Day of Employment.  Such award shall be calculated and paid in accordance with Section 2.10.
Acceleration of Vesting
 
(a)           .  If a Participant experiences a Qualifying Termination, Participant shall be entitled to pro-rata vesting of any Performance Share Units that were awarded more than one year prior to the Qualifying Termination based on the achievement of the Targets as of the last day of the Performance Period.

Notwithstanding Sections 2.5 and 2.6, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control before the Participant has experienced Termination of Employment with the Company other than a termination described in Section 2.7, the Performance Share Units shall be cancelled and a number of Restricted Share Units shall be issued that equal the portion of the number of cancelled Performance Share Units that would become vested under Section 2.5 based on:  (i) the assumption that performance would have been at Target Performance for Cumulative Three Year Pre-Tax Earnings; (ii) Relative TSR through the date of the Change of Control; and (iii) if the Participant terminated employment in a manner described in Section 2.7 prior to the Change of Control the number of Restricted Share Units shall be further adjusted for the pro-rata adjustment required by Section 2.7.  Such Restricted Share Units shall be subject to the terms set forth in this Section 2.8.  Unless the Participant terminated employment before the Change of Control under a circumstance described in Section 2.7, such Restricted Share Units shall not vest until the last day of the Performance Period that applied to the cancelled Performance Share Units.

Change of Control
 
Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 2.8, in order to become vested in the Restricted Share Units, the Participant must remain in continuous employment of the Company until the last day of the Performance Period that applied to the cancelled Performance Share Units.  Absent an agreement to the contrary, if the Participant experiences a Termination of Employment with the Company for any reason, other than Qualifying Termination, Good Reason Termination, Retirement, Early Retirement, Death or Disability prior to the last day of the Performance Period that applied to the cancelled Performance Share Units, all Restricted Share Units shall be forfeited by the Participant. If a Participant has a Termination of Employment following a Change of Control due to a Qualifying Termination, a Good Reason Termination, Retirement, Early Retirement, Death, or Disability, the Participant shall, upon the occurrence of such termination, become 100% vested in all outstanding Restricted Share Units awarded under this Grant Agreement calculated as set forth above.
 
Within sixty (60) days following vesting of the Restricted Share Units, an equal number of shares of Common Stock shall be transferred directly into a brokerage account established for the Participant at a financial institution the Committee shall select at its sole discretion (the Financial Institution) or delivered in certificate form free of restrictions, such method to be selected by the Committee in its sole discretion upon:  (i) if the Participant Terminated Employment before a

If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control a corporation within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(5)(vi), the acquisition of additional control of the corporation by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the effective control of the corporation.

Amount of Gain Realized
 
1.2           .  Change of Control means the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
Change of Control

If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of H&R Block, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons shall not be considered to cause a Change of Control.  An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a

group, as a result of a transaction in which H&R Block acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this Section 1.2(a).
 
(b)           Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of H&R Block possessing 35 percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of H&R Block.  If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control a corporation within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(5)(vi), the acquisition of additional control of the corporation by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the effective control of the corporation.
 
(c)           A majority of members of H&R Block Board of Directors (the Board) is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the Board before the date of such appointment or election.

For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of H&R Block, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no Change of Control event under this Section 1.2(d) when there is a transfer to an entity that is controlled by the shareholders of H&R Block immediately after the transfer. A transfer of assets by H&R Block is not treated as a change in the ownership of such assets if the assets are transferred to:  (i) a shareholder of H&R Block (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock; (ii) an entity, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by H&R Block; (iii) a person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of H&R Block; or (iv) an entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in (iii) above.
