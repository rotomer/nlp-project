In addition, the 2012 Credit Facility includes provisions which allow the Company to cure any potential default, including an equity cure.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 20, 2012
 
KANSAS CITY, Mo - H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB) announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary, Block Financial LLC, entered into a new five-year, $1.5 billion Credit and Guarantee Agreement, which will  expire on Aug. 17, 2017 unless extended pursuant to the terms of the agreement.
