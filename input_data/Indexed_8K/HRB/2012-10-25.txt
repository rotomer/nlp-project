The Company and the Parent Guarantor will effect the filings required under Rule 424(b), in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)), and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the form of prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424(b) was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file such prospectus. The Company and the Parent Guarantor will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment. The Company and the Parent Guarantor have paid the registration fee for this offering pursuant to Rule 456(b)(1) under the 1933 Act or will pay such fee within the time period required by such rule (without giving effect to the proviso therein) and in any event prior to the Closing Time.

The Company and the Parent Guarantor have given the Underwriters notice of any filings made pursuant to the 1934 Act or 1934 Act Regulations within 48 hours prior to the Applicable Time; the Company and the Parent Guarantor will give the Underwriters notice of its intention to make any such filing from the Applicable Time to the Closing Time and will furnish the Underwriters with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not file or use any such document to which the Underwriters or counsel for the Underwriters shall reasonably object. The Company and the Parent Guarantor will prepare a final term sheet, a copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule C (the "Final Term Sheet"), reflecting the final terms of the Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters, and shall file such Final Term Sheet as an "issuer free writing prospectus" pursuant to Rule 433 prior to the close of business two business days after the date hereof; provided that the Company shall furnish the Underwriters with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Underwriters or counsel to the Underwriters shall object.

Continued Compliance with Securities Laws
 
the Company and the Parent Guarantor, to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include any untrue statements of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement or to file a new registration statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company and the Parent Guarantor will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, the Company and the Parent Guarantor will use their best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable (if it is not an automatic shelf registration statement with respect to the Securities) and the Company and the Parent Guarantor will furnish to the Underwriters such number of copies of such amendment, supplement or new registration statement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company and the Parent Guarantor will promptly notify the Representative and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
(e) . The Company and the Parent Guarantor will use their reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as the Underwriters may reasonably designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for so long as required for distribution of the securities; provided, however, that the Company and the Parent Guarantor shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. The Company and the Parent Guarantor will also supply the Underwriters with such information as is necessary for the determination of the legality of the Securities for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may reasonably request.
Blue Sky Qualifications
(f) . The Parent Guarantor will timely file such reports pursuant to the 1934 Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide to the Underwriters the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and Rule 158 of the Commission promulgated thereunder.

Reporting Requirements
 
(j) The Company and the Parent Guarantor represent and agree that, unless they obtain the prior consent of the Representative, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company, the Parent Guarantor and the Representative, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; provided, however, that prior to the preparation of the Final Term Sheet in accordance with Section 3(b), the Underwriters are authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Securities in communications conveying information relating to the offering to investors. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company, the Parent Guarantor and the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company and the Parent Guarantor represent that they have treated or agree that they will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.

Indemnification
(a) . The Company and the Parent Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the 1933 Act (each, an "Affiliate"), its directors, officers and selling agents and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Underwriters
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim and damage whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing
 
Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim and damage whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company and the Parent Guarantor;
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel to the extent provided in Section 6(c)), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
(b) . Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Parent Guarantor and each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Parent Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company and the Parent Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed upon that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: (i) in the third paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" regarding concession and reallowance figures and (ii) in the ninth and tenth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" relating to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids.
Indemnification of Company, Parent Guarantor, Directors and Officers
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, the indemnifying party may assume the defense of any litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, including the employment of counsel. In any such litigation or proceeding the defense of which the indemnifying party shall have so assumed, any indemnified party shall have the right to participate in such litigation or proceeding and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of such counsel or experts, (ii) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest ; (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed in a timely manner to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party in such litigation or proceeding or (iv) the named parties to any such litigation or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of the indemnifying party and any indemnified party by the same counsel would, in the reasonable opinion of the indemnified party, be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the indemnifying party and any such indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Parent Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Parent Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Parent Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Parent Guarantor and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
 
The relative fault of the Company and the Parent Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Parent Guarantor or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Parent Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company or the Parent Guarantor, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Parent Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Parent Guarantor. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company and the Parent Guarantor or any of their subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or its Affiliates, directors, officers or selling agents, any person controlling any Underwriter, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company or the Parent Guarantor or (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.

(b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

(b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

If the rating from S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the interest rate on the Notes has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth in the tables above, the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Moody's (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to Baa3 or higher and S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) increases its rating to BBB- or higher (or, in either case if applicable, the equivalent rating of any Substitute Rating Agency) the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased to the Original Interest Rate.
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Notes be reduced to below the Original Interest Rate or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.

If none of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.
 
If at any time either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) ceases to provide a rating of the Notes for reasons outside of the Company's control, the Company may, at its option, obtain a rating of the Notes from another nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Exchange Act, to the extent one exists, and if another nationally recognized statistical rating organization rates the Notes (such organization, as certified by the Company in writing to the Trustee, a ""), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Notes pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last such rating agency to provide a rating of the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating until such time, if any, as such rating agency resumes providing a rating of the Notes, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's, S&P or any prior Substitute Rating Agency (if applicable), as the case may be, in such table and for any other purpose described in this section and (c) the interest rate on the Notes will increase, decrease or remain unchanged, as the case may be, as described above to reflect any change in the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) compared to the prior percentage, if any, corresponding to the rating agency for which the Substitute Rating Agency has been substituted. If Moody's or S&P either ceases to provide a rating of the Notes for reasons within the Company's control, the Company will not be entitled to obtain a rating from a Substitute Rating Agency and the increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes shall be determined in the manner described above as if either only one or no rating agency provides a rating of the Notes, as the case may be.
Substitute Rating Agency
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
The interest rate on the Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency)) if the Notes become rated Baa1 and BBB+ or higher by Moody's and S&P, respectively (or, in either case if applicable, the equivalent rating of any Substitute Rating Agency) (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency), with a stable or positive outlook by each of the rating agencies.

(d) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Guarantor's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be considered to be a Change of Control if (1) the Guarantor becomes a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to a holding company and (2) immediately following that transaction, (A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of the holding company are substantially the same as the Holders of the Guarantor's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) no Person or Group is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the holding company.

In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof together with interest accrued thereon, if any, may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
If the rating from Moody's (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If the rating from S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the interest rate on the Notes has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth in the tables above, the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Moody's (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to Baa3 or higher and S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) increases its rating to BBB- or higher (or, in either case if applicable, the equivalent rating of any Substitute Rating Agency) the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased to the Original Interest Rate.
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Notes be reduced to below the Original Interest Rate or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.
If either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) ceases to provide a rating of the Notes and a Substitute Rating Agency is not obtained as provided below, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes shall be made solely as a result of either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) ceasing to provide a rating. If none of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.
If at any time either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) ceases to provide a rating of the Notes for reasons outside of the Company's control, the Company may, at its option, obtain a rating of the Notes from another nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Exchange Act, to the extent one exists, and if another nationally recognized statistical rating organization rates the Notes (such organization, as certified by the Comapny in writing to the Trustee, a "Substitute Rating Agency"), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Notes pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last such rating agency to provide a rating of the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating until such time, if any, as such rating agency resumes providing a rating of the Notes, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's, S&P or any prior Substitute Rating Agency (if applicable), as the case may be, in such table and for any other purpose described in this section and (c) the interest rate on the Notes will increase, decrease or remain unchanged, as the case may be, as described above to reflect any change in the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) compared to the prior percentage, if any, corresponding to the rating agency for which the Substitute Rating Agency has been substituted. If Moody's or S&P either ceases to provide a rating of the Notes for reasons within the Company's control, the Company will not be entitled to obtain a rating from a Substitute Rating Agency and the increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes shall be determined in the manner described above as if either only one or no rating agency provides a rating of the Notes, as the case may be.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
The interest rate on the Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency)) if the Notes become rated Baa1 and BBB+ or higher by Moody's and S&P, respectively (or, in either case if applicable, the equivalent rating of any Substitute Rating Agency) (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency), with a stable or positive outlook by each of the rating agencies.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) reduce the percentage in principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment; (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Notes; (iii) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Notes; (iv) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Notes or change the time at which any Notes may or will be redeemed; (v) make any Notes payable in Currency other than that stated in the Notes; (vi) release any security that may have been granted in respect of the Notes; or (vii) make any change in any of the provisions of the Indenture relating to directing the Trustee and waiving defaults or amendments that require unanimous consent.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, if any, and interest on this Note at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue) for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note, as herein provided, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice of the contrary. All payments made to or upon the order of such registered Holder shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, effectually satisfy and discharge liability for moneys payable on this Note.

"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date:
(a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or

In addition, at its option, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or following May 1, 2022 (the date falling six months prior to the maturity date of the Notes) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
Notice of any redemption shall be given at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed. Notices of redemption may not be conditional. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee shall select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; , , that, so long as the Notes are held in book-entry form, the Notes shall be selected for redemption in accordance with the Depositary's then-current practice.

For all purposes hereof:
"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the ratings on the Notes are lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Notes are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of the Change of Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies); provided that a Below Investment Grade Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee or the Company in writing at the Trustee's or the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating Event).
"Capital Stock" of any Person means any and all shares, interests, rights to purchase, warrants, options, participation or other equivalents of or interests in (however designated) equity of such Person, including any preferred stock and limited liability or partnership interests (whether general or limited), but excluding any debt securities convertible into such equity.

(b) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Guarantor;
(c) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any Person or Group (other than the Company or the Guarantor or one of their subsidiaries) becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the then outstanding number of shares of the Company's or the Guarantor's Voting Stock; or
(d) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Guarantor's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be considered to be a Change of Control if (1) the Guarantor becomes a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to a holding company and (2) immediately following that transaction, (A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of the holding company are substantially the same as the Holders of the Guarantor's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) no Person or Group is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the holding company.
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Rating Event.
"Continuing Director" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Guarantor's Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Guarantor's Board of Directors on the date of the issuance of the Notes or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Guarantor's Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Guarantor's Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Guarantor's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director).

"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Moody's and S&P and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Guarantor (as certified by a resolution of the Guarantor's Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P or either of them, as the case may be.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. or its successor.

Unless a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred, the Holders of the Notes shall not have the right to demand repayment of the Notes prior to maturity.
The Notes will not be entitled to any sinking fund.
In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof together with interest accrued thereon, if any, may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The interest rate payable on the Notes shall be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency (as defined below)) downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating assigned to the Notes, as set forth below.
If the rating from Moody's (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If the rating from S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) of the Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the interest rate on the Notes has been adjusted upward and either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth in the tables above, the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate for the Notes equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Moody's (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to Baa3 or higher and S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) increases its rating to BBB- or higher (or, in either case if applicable, the equivalent rating of any Substitute Rating Agency) the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased to the Original Interest Rate.
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency), shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Notes be reduced to below the Original Interest Rate or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.
If either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) ceases to provide a rating of the Notes and a Substitute Rating Agency is not obtained as provided below, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes shall be made solely as a result of either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) ceasing to provide a rating. If none of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.
If at any time either Moody's or S&P (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency) ceases to provide a rating of the Notes for reasons outside of the Company's control, the Company may, at its option, obtain a rating of the Notes from another nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Exchange Act, to the extent one exists, and if another nationally recognized statistical rating organization rates the Notes (such organization, as certified by the Comapny in writing to the Trustee, a "Substitute Rating Agency"), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Notes pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last such rating agency to provide a rating of the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating until such time, if any, as such rating agency resumes providing a rating of the Notes, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's, S&P or any prior Substitute Rating Agency (if applicable), as the case may be, in such table and for any other purpose described in this section and (c) the interest rate on the Notes will increase, decrease or remain unchanged, as the case may be, as described above to reflect any change in the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of
clause (b) above) compared to the prior percentage, if any, corresponding to the rating agency for which the Substitute Rating Agency has been substituted. If Moody's or S&P either ceases to provide a rating of the Notes for reasons within the Company's control, the Company will not be entitled to obtain a rating from a Substitute Rating Agency and the increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Notes shall be determined in the manner described above as if either only one or no rating agency provides a rating of the Notes, as the case may be.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
The interest rate on the Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies (or any applicable Substitute Rating Agency)) if the Notes become rated Baa1 and BBB+ or higher by Moody's and S&P, respectively (or, in either case if applicable, the equivalent rating of any Substitute Rating Agency) (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency), with a stable or positive outlook by each of the rating agencies.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) reduce the percentage in principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment; (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Notes; (iii) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Notes; (iv) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Notes or change the time at which any Notes may or will be redeemed; (v) make any Notes payable in Currency other than that stated in the Notes; (vi) release any security that may have been granted in respect of the Notes; or (vii) make any change in any of the provisions of the Indenture relating to directing the Trustee and waiving defaults or amendments that require unanimous consent. It is also provided in the Indenture that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a series at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default under the Indenture with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security of such series or in respect of a covenant or provision which cannot be modified without the consent of each Holder affected thereby. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, if any, and interest on this Note at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.

The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000. In the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, but without the payment of any service charge, Notes may be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue) for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note, as herein provided, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice of the contrary. All payments made to or upon the order of such registered Holder shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, effectually satisfy and discharge liability for moneys payable on this Note.

Morgan Securities LLC, as representative of the underwriters.
In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-184343), filed by the Companies on October 9, 2012 (the "Registration Statement"); (ii) the prospectus, dated October 9, 2012 (the "Base Prospectus"), which forms a part of the Registration Statement; (iii) the prospectus supplement, dated October 22, 2012 (the "Prospectus Supplement," and, together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"); (iv) the indenture, dated as of October 20, 1997, among the Issuer (formerly known as Block Financial Corporation), the Guarantor and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (formerly known as Bankers Trust Company), as trustee, (the "Base Indenture"); (v) the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 18, 2000, among the Issuer (formerly known as Block Financial Corporation), the Guarantor and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (formerly known as Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture"); (vi) the officers' certificate of the Issuer, dated as of October 25, 2012, establishing the terms of the Notes (the "Officers' Certificate" and together with the Base Indenture the "Indenture"); (vii) executed copies of global certificates representing the Notes; and (viii) such corporate and limited liability company records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Issuer and the Guarantor, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
