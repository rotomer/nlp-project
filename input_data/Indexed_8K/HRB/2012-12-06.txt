Forward-Looking Statements
This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws.

By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, a variety of economic, competitive and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control and which are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2012 in the section entitled Risk Factors, as well as additional factors we may describe from time to time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.

     Basic earnings per share is computed using the two-class method and is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding.  The dilutive effect of potential common shares is included in diluted earnings per share, except in those periods with a loss from continuing operations.
     On October 25, 2012, we issued $500.0 million of 5.50% Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are due November 1, 2022, and are not redeemable by the bondholders prior to maturity.
