COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK
 
"We are pleased with the company's continued success in building our branded, value-added product business, which has helped stabilize our performance in difficult environments," said Joel Johnson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.  "In the second quarter, the benefits from branded products balanced the negative impact of the lingering protein glut.
"The Grocery Products segment had an exceptional second quarter in terms of sales growth and profitability.  Core brands like the Family of products, chili, stew and bacon bits all delivered healthy volume increases and solid market shares behind aggressive marketing programs.  Profit growth reflected low raw material costs that are unlikely to be as favorable in the second half," Johnson said.  "Even though Refrigerated Foods continued to deal with the protein oversupply, it delivered greatly improved profitability as a result of better margins from value-added products and the reduction of non-branded product sales.

"The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment was the most severely impacted in the second quarter as excess turkey meat pressured pricing throughout the industry," Johnson continued.  "This continues to overwhelm the synergies we have gained from The Turkey Store Company acquisition and the aggressive, successful expansion of our value-added turkey product lines.  We remain focused on making turkey an everyday menu item leveraging our strong market position with the expectation of strengthening profits once the turkey markets return to normal levels.
 
 "We were pleased with the first full quarter of the Diamond Crystal Brands business which made a positive contribution to the bottom line," Johnson said.  "The integration of this business is on schedule with our plan.
 
 "We expect domestic pork markets to continue their improvement and return to normal levels in the second half of fiscal 2003.  The outlook for the turkey market is the most uncertain.  After assessing industry factors and our own business plans and prospects, our earnings guidance for the third quarter is in a range of $.27 to $.33 per diluted share," Johnson concluded.
