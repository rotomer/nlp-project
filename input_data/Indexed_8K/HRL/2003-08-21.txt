Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL-News), the multinational marketer of consumer-branded meat and food products, today reported fiscal 2003 third quarter net earnings of $34.7 million, down 9 percent from $38.3 million a year earlier.  Earnings per share were $.25 versus $.27 in the fiscal 2002 third quarter.  Sales totaled $1.0 billion, up from $933.8 million in the same period last year.
 
For the nine months ended July 26, net earnings were $115.4 million, or $.83 per share, compared to $121.4 million, or $.86 per share in the prior year.  Sales totaled $3.0 billion, up from $2.9 billion in the same period last year.
 
COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK
 
"Exceptionally strong performance by Refrigerated Foods was offset by commodity value pressures in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment in the third quarter" said Joel Johnson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. "Refrigerated Foods operating profit increased sharply as a result of normalized pork contract results and higher demand for branded value-added products," Johnson continued.  "The very difficult turkey market put more pressure than we anticipated on our overall performance and caused us to miss our guidance range by $.02 per share," said Johnson.  "The normal seasonal strengthening of the turkey market did not happen this year because of excess inventory industry-wide.   Despite the disappointing results from our turkey operations this quarter, the long-term outlook for this business is very promising. Our development of new, value-added products continues to be strong, and Jennie-O Turkey Store remains one of the most efficient and highly integrated producers in the industry.  We are confident that this business is well positioned and its contribution to Hormel Foods will become more evident once the turkey market oversupply clears," Johnson continued.

"The Refrigerated Foods segment reported a significant third-quarter operating profit gain of 61 percent.  The benefits of our value-added product initiatives are becoming visible now that we have more normal cost conditions in the pork industry," said Johnson.  "Value-added products such as our Fully Cooked Entrees and Fresh Pork were key contributors to the strong performance.

"As expected, Grocery Products experienced higher beef and pork costs, which reduced operating profits 8 percent," Johnson said.  "Sales dollars grew 1 percent with support from bacon bits, chunk meats and chili.  These increases were somewhat offset by lower sales in sauces, canned items and the Family of products," Johnson said.  "The Family of products had a very strong second quarter, which I suspect led to higher than normal pantry inventories that had to be liquidated in the third quarter.

 "We were pleased to announce recently the acquisition of Century Foods International, a manufacturer of nutritional products, dairy proteins and blends, and cheese products.  Century Foods will report as part of our Specialty Foods Segment.  This addition further diversifies our company and provides new opportunities for growth," Johnson stated.
 
"Even though we see signs of recovery in the turkey markets, the fourth quarter will be another difficult period for our turkey business.  We expect solid results from the Refrigerated Foods segment with pork dynamics within historical norms. Grocery Products will face higher raw material costs compared to last year but sales of these products typically strengthen in the fourth quarter.  After assessing industry factors and our own business plans and prospects, our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter is in a range of $.36 to $.44," Johnson concluded.
