Earnings per share were $.50 versus $.49 in the fiscal 2002 fourth quarter.  Sales totaled $1.2 billion, up from $1.0 billion in the same period last year.

COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK
 
"Strong demand for our refrigerated, value-added products and a faster-than-expected turnaround in the turkey markets provided a strong finish to our fiscal year," said Joel W. Johnson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. "Refrigerated Foods was the clear stand-out with operating profit up 183 percent, or $33.6 million, compared to last year's fourth quarter.  With pork markets back to normal, the benefits of our value-added products such as Fully Cooked Entrees and Pre-cooked Bacon, are more visible," Johnson continued.  "Foodservice continued to deliver strong growth in key categories, including boneless pork, smoked bacon, and BBQ.

"Strengthening turkey markets provided better-than-expected results from the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment in the fourth quarter," Johnson commented.  "Growth in our value-added products accelerated the recovery in this segment and we are positioned very well now that markets have returned to more normal levels," Johnson continued.
 
"Grocery Products margins were pressured because of higher beef and pork raw material costs in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago.  Higher promotion and marketing spending also negatively affected operating profits," Johnson said.  Sales revenue declined 4 percent primarily due to lower sales from canned products, sauces and products.Our sales comparison for products is versus last year's pipeline sell-in," Johnson said.  "These losses were partially offset by growth in other core categories such as the Family of products, chili and bacon bits," Johnson said.

 "The integration of Century Foods International into our Specialty Foods segment is on plan and going well. In fact, Century Foods made a positive contribution in its first quarter of operation.  Hormel HealthLabs also reported strong growth in sales and profit for the fourth quarter compared to a year ago," Johnson stated.
 
"Despite the challenges of fiscal 2003, we concluded the year as an even stronger global competitor," Johnson said.  "More than 30 of our brands hold first or second market shares in their respective product categories, and the proportion of Hormel Foods value-added products in our sales mix has reached record levels. Our product platform is more diverse than ever and we are well positioned to serve fast-growing markets, including special diets, dining away from home, ethnic flavors, deli products, and case-ready fresh meats.  Careful financial management enables us to reward shareholders, seize strategic opportunities and invest to grow the business," Johnson said.
 
"We are optimistic about 2004 now that protein markets are closer to normal.  We expect the performance of our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments to reflect the improvements we have made to the product mix within these segments over the last couple of years.  However, Grocery Products will face higher raw material costs compared to last year pressuring margins.  We will also increase investment in this segment for additional marketing and product development initiatives.
"After assessing industry factors and our own business plans and prospects, our earnings guidance for the first quarter is in a range of $.32 to $.36.  For the full year of fiscal 2004, our earnings guidance is in a range of  $1.44 to $1.60," Johnson concluded.
 
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
 
Grocery Products (18 % of Net Sales, 45 % of Segment Operating Profit)
Fourth Quarter
Dollar sales totaled $209 million, down 4 percent.
 - 
                 
Volume was down by 3 percent.  Weaker sales from products,which were introduced at the end of the third quarter of 2002,and canned products caused the fourth quarter to be down compared to last year.  In response, we are strengthening our consumer support for the core products to communicate its convenience as the original meal solution.  Volume for sauces was also down.  Double-digit volume growth was reported by bacon bits, chili, and microwave entrees, which helped offset part of the loss.  Volume for the Family of products was up 2 percent.
