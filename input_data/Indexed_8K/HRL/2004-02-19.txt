Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL-News), the multinational marketer of consumer-branded meat and food products, today reported fiscal 2004 first quarter net earnings of $51.8 million, up 10 percent from $46.9 million a year earlier.  Earnings per share were $.37 versus $.34 (prior year includes 2 cents of net earnings from non-recurring items) in the fiscal 2003 first quarter.  Sales totaled $1.1 billion, up from $1.0 billion in the same period last year.
 
COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK
 
"Exceptional demand for our value-added pork and turkey products resulted in better-than-expected performance in the first quarter," said Joel W. Johnson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. "Our protein businesses, Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store, have made significant progress in improving their product mix.  Products that offer great flavor and convenience  such as pre-cooked bacon, fully cooked entrees and "So Easy" fully cooked entrees  were the best performers in the quarter," Johnson continued.  "With pork and turkey markets back to normal, the benefits of our value-added products are more visible," Johnson

said.  "Foodservice also continued to deliver strong growth, with dollar sales up 15 percent, driven by key brands including boneless pork, meats, and BBQ.

"Grocery Products faced a difficult comparison in the first quarter because of higher pork and beef raw material costs," Johnson said.  "Most of the sales and volume decline was due to lower sales of the product line," Johnson continued.  "This decrease reflected two factors: last year's pipeline fill and this year's below-plan sales," Johnson said.  "We expect Grocery Products will again face difficult comparisons next quarter because of higher raw material costs this year and war-induced pantry loading' last year.  However, we have many exciting initiatives within this segment planned for 2004, and we believe Grocery Products will strengthen as the year unfolds," Johnson concluded.

"The integration of Century Foods International and Diamond Crystal Brands continues to meet our expectations in our Specialty Foods Segment," said Johnson.  "Higher promotion and integration expenses, and a temporary shift in product mix caused margins to be lower than planned, but expect to see improvement in the upcoming quarters," Johnson said.
 
"Our International business reported strong results, with volume up 47 percent and operating profit up 36 percent," Johnson said.  "Strong margins from international sales of the Family of Products, chili and improved earnings from the China operations were key contributors to the increased profits," Johnson concluded.
