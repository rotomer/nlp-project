COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK
 
"The success of our value-added pork and turkey products continued in the second quarter, delivering better-than-expected performance," said Joel W. Johnson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. "Despite increased cost pressures from the grain markets, our protein businesses, Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store, reported outstanding results because of the strong demand for our branded, value-added products.  With dollar sales up 22 percent, our Foodservice business unit, of
the Refrigerated Foods Segment, was an important component of our performance," Johnson stated.  "Products contributing double-digit growth include bacon, pepperoni and Canadian bacon. Jennie-O Turkey Store items providing double-digit growth include bacon, marinated tenderloins and homestyle deli breasts," Johnson continued.

"The Grocery Products Segment's performance reflected its struggle with difficult comparisons.  First, continued pork and beef raw material cost increases put additional pressure on margins.  Second, last year's second quarter was an exceptional growth period, with volume up 10 percent," Johnson said.  "To improve margins, we will increase prices 4.5 to 6.5 percent for all Grocery Products items effective June 14," Johnson continued.  "Relating to volume, we have several initiatives underway to regain momentum in this segment," Johnson said.  "Our ethnic products delivered positive results within this segment.  Revenues increased 14 percent, led by our olive oil and authentic Mexican products.  The strength of our ethic brands continues to build," Johnson commented.  "The volume weakness in Grocery Products came primarily from our productsand canned products," Johnson said.   "We had extremely difficult comparisons in the first half 2004, and I expect our second- half comparisons to improve considerably," Johnson concluded.

"Century Foods International and Diamond Crystal Brands delivered strong results in the quarter.  Both acquisitions are fully integrated into our business and are meeting our expectations," Johnson said.
 
"Our International business reported strong export results, with volume up 27 percent," Johnson said.  "Exceptional international demand for pork products drove the volume increase," Johnson concluded.
 
"The sales reorganization project continues to make good progress.  We have taken a 2-cent-per-share one-time restructuring charge this quarter to account for early retirement packages.  This change will enable us to streamline our sales organization to better serve our customers," said Johnson.
 
"After assessing industry factors and our own business plans and prospects, our earnings guidance for the third quarter is in a range of $.30 to $.36 per share.  For the full year of fiscal 2004, our earnings guidance is in a range of $1.50 to $1.62," Johnson concluded.
 
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
 
Grocery Products (16 % of Net Sales, 30 % of Segment Operating Profit)
 
Dollar sales totaled $187 million, down 1 percent.
 - 
                 
Volume was down by 6 percent.  Weaker sales from productsand canned products represented most of the decrease. We have significantly reduced distribution for the products because this line of products was not meeting our profit objectives and the category did not develop as we expected.  The canned products had a very difficult comparison, with volume up 32 percent in the prior year.  Double-digit growth was reported by olive oil, Mexican products, Indian products, bacon bits and microwave products.

Operating profit was down 22 percent, or $8 million, reflecting higher raw material costs for pork and beef.  The volume loss from our canned products also caused operating profits to decrease.

Dollar sales totaled $542 million, up 14 percent.

Volume decreased 3 percent due to reduced production levels during a renovation at our Fremont, NE facility.  Full production has resumed.
 - 
                 
Operating profit improved 167 percent to $37 million, reflecting improved market conditions and higher returns on value-added, branded products.
 - 
                 
Strong pork demand generated a 30-percent improvement in the live hog market prices versus last year.  This aligned our hog contract costs with open market prices.
 - 
                 
Growth momentum in our retail value-added products continued.  Leading the growth within this segment included double-digit volume performers Fully Cooked Entrees, Canadian bacon, pre-cooked bacon and dry sausage products.

Dollar sales increased 11 percent to $240 million.

JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE
Higher grain costs continued to increase live bird production costs in the second quarter and we expect the same grain cost burden in the second half of the year.  So far, higher meat markets are off-setting the higher grain costs.
 - 
                 
Foodservice volume was up 25 percent.
 - 
                 
Export bans relating to Avian Influenza are still in place by China.  Russia and Mexico, the two largest markets for turkey exports, are open to U.S. poultry from areas outside of the initially affected regions within the states of Delaware and Texas.  Overall, turkey export markets are very good.
 -

Dollar sales increased 19 percent to $52 million.
 - 
                 
Volume was 36 percent higher than a year earlier, primarily due to strong export sales of fresh pork and solid growth from our subsidiary, Dan's Prize, which sells cooked beef to the foodservice channel.
 - 
                 
Operating profit was up 28 percent.  Strong margins from Dan's Prize and Vista International Packaging were key contributors to the increased operating profit.
