This compares to fiscal 2003 net earnings of $185.8 million (includes a $3.9 million gain from a vitamin antitrust settlement and a $1.1 million charge for a plant closing) or $1.33 per share (includes $.02 gain from previously listed items).  Sales totaled $4.8 billion, up from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2003.
 
The company's accounting cycle resulted in a 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week year in fiscal 2004, compared with a 13-week fourth quarter and 52-week year in fiscal 2003.
 
COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK
 
"Our strong fourth quarter was supported by very good demand for our value-added pork and turkey products," said Joel W. Johnson, chairman of the board and chief executive officer.  "As we noted in the November 11 earnings pre-announcement, our Jennie-O Turkey Store business delivered better-than-expected results driven by outstanding demand for turkey products and excellent market conditions.  We continue to see this strength into the first quarter of fiscal 2005, which gives us a great start to the new year," Johnson said.
 
"Refrigerated Foods' operating profit declined from last year's extraordinarily strong fourth quarter. The fiscal 2003 fourth quarter was extremely unusual in that ideal market conditions afforded us optimal margins.  The full-year comparison, however, clearly shows that we achieved considerable improvement in fiscal 2004, with operating profit margins increasing to 6.1 percent versus 5.1 percent in fiscal 2003.  This margin improvement was driven by double-digit growth in value-added categories such as sliced meats, fully cooked refrigerated entrees, flavored meats and pepperoni," Johnson said.
 
"Our Foodservice businesses continue to deliver outstanding growth.  Both Hormel Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store Foodservice business units delivered double-digit growth, with dollar sales up 28 percent and 26 percent, respectively.  Products contributing strong growth include , BBQ products, pork and oven roasted and pre-sliced products," Johnson stated.

"Even though Grocery Products continues to deal with higher pork raw material costs, the price increase we implemented in the third quarter helped strengthen margins.  Our national roll-out of chili is going well, driving over-all fourth quarter chili sales up 4 percent compared with last year," Johnson said.

"Our International business reported strong growth, with volume up 25 percent.  Business in China continues to be good with double-digit growth in both retail and foodservice," Johnson said.  "We are excited about the opportunities in the Philippines as well. To support this growth, we just opened our second plant in that country," Johnson commented.
 
"After assessing industry factors and our business plans and prospects, our earnings guidance for the first quarter is in a range of $.40 to $.46 per share, versus actual results of $.37 in fiscal 2004.  For the full year of fiscal 2005, our earnings guidance is in a range of $1.65 to $1.75," Johnson concluded.
