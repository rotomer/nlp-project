COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK
 
"Our top and bottom lines reflected impressive growth as a result of outstanding demand for our value-added pork and turkey products," said Joel W. Johnson, chairman of the board and chief executive officer.  "Also, our ability to raise prices within the Grocery Products Segment in June of last year enabled us to recover higher input costs," Johnson said.
 
"We are excited about the recent additions to our portfolio of Clougherty Packing and Arriba Foods (Mexican Accent).  Clougherty Packing, the company behind the brand, which we acquired at the end of December, is a logical fit for our organization.  Its strong west coast brand and strategic west coast manufacturing location strengthen our position in the market and we look forward to Clougherty Packing's many contributions to our organization. The Mexican Accent purchase, which was

completed at the end of January, complements our fast-growing ethnic products portfolio," Johnson stated.
 
"Several key brands contributed to our success in the quarter, with the standout performance coming from the Jennie-O Turkey Store Segment,"   Johnson commented.  "On top of very good value-added growth in our turkey segment, strong market conditions and decreasing feed costs helped deliver the outstanding results," said Johnson.
 
"We continue to see aggressive growth in our Foodservice businesses.  The Hormel Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store Foodservice business unit dollar sales were up 14 percent and 8 percent, respectively.  Brands contributing strong growth include products, BBQ products, pork and oven roasted products," Johnson stated.

"Improvements in our Grocery Products sales and operating profit were driven by double-digit growth in and chili, and the family of products.  Consumer response to our national roll-out of chili and the aggressive marketing support behind and chili have been very good.  Ethnic brands also reported solid results within this segment, with sales up 8%," Johnson said.
