Three acquisitions, Mexican Accent, Mark-Lynn Foods and Lloyd's Barbeque Company completed in the quarter
 
Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL-News), the multinational marketer of consumer-branded meat and food products, today reported fiscal 2005 second quarter net earnings of $55.8 million, up 4 percent from $53.7 million a year earlier.  Earnings per share were $.40 this year compared with $.38 last year.  Sales totaled $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2004.
 
For the six months ended May 1, 2005, net earnings were $120.3 million, or $.86 per share (up 15 percent), compared to $105.5 million a year ago, or $.75 per share.  Sales totaled $2.6 billion, up 13 percent, from $2.3 billion in the same period last year.
 
COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK
 
"Our turkey business was the clear stand-out in the quarter.  A combination of continued value-added sales growth, higher turkey meat markets, lower grain markets and efficiencies in our production facilities all contributed. We expect this same operating environment for the rest of the year," said Joel W. Johnson, chairman of the board and chief executive officer.
 
"The Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods segment margins were pressured because of higher pork and beef raw material costs compared to last year.  Nonetheless, we increased advertising and promotional spending during the quarter to strengthen our position in the market going forward," Johnson said.
 
"We are making good progress integrating the three acquisitions that were announced during the second quarter, Mexican Accent, Mark-Lynn Foods and Lloyd's Barbeque Company.  These businesses fit our strategies to grow our ethnic and Foodservice businesses, and bring value-added products to the meat case.  The contributions from these businesses are expected to accelerate in the second half of the year," commented Johnson.
 
"Our strategy to produce convenient, value-added products continues to deliver results.  Retail categories with solid growth in the quarter include fully cooked bacon, fully cooked entrees, case-ready products and tray pack items.  Foodservice products reporting double-digit growth include BBQ, pork and products," Johnson said.

"Grocery Products reported mixed results.  While products within the microwave category delivered double-digit growth and our chili volume was up, we continue to see weakness in the canned stew category," Johnson stated.  "Our Grocery Products segment continues to have leading market share positions in many of the categories in which we compete, and we expect to see better profitability in this segment when protein markets trend lower," Johnson said.
 
"After assessing industry factors and our business plans and prospects, our earnings guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 is in a range of $.34 to $.40 per share.  For the full year of fiscal 2005, we are maintaining our earnings guidance of $1.70 to $1.80," Johnson concluded.
