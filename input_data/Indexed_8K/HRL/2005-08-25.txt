Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL-News), the multinational marketer of consumer-branded meat and food products, today reported fiscal 2005 third quarter net earnings of $51.4 million, up 15 percent from adjusted earnings from operations of $44.8 million a year earlier (last year GAAP earnings were $56.3 million, which includes $11.5 million after tax gain from the sale of Vista).  Diluted earnings per share were $.37 this year compared to $.32 per share from adjusted earnings from operations last year (GAAP earnings were $.40 per share, which includes $.08 per share gain from the sale of Vista).  Sales totaled $1.4 billion, up from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2004.
 
For the nine months ended July 31, 2005, net earnings were $171.7 million, or $1.23 per diluted share (up 14 percent), compared to $150.3 million from adjusted earnings from operations a year ago, or $1.07 per diluted share (GAAP earnings were $161.8 million and $1.15 per share, which includes $11.5 million after tax gain from Vista sale, or $.08 per share).  Sales totaled $3.9 billion, up 15 percent, from $3.4 billion in the same period last year.
COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK
 
"Our turkey business delivered another outstanding quarter driven by continued value-added sales growth, lower grain markets and efficiencies in our production facilities.  Impressive growth from several of our value-added products in Refrigerated Foods and key categories in the Grocery Products segment benefited the bottom line as well," said Joel W. Johnson, chairman of the board and chief executive officer.  "The acquisitions that were completed earlier in the year are gaining momentum and made positive contributions also," Johnson said.
 
"The year-over-year improvement in both the top and bottom line reported by the Grocery Products segment is encouraging.  Two important areas of growth include the microwave line of products and the family of products," Johnson said.  "Chili shipments were down in the quarter versus last year, partially due to pipe line inventory gains last year as chili was expanded nationally. Looking forward, we have good commitments for the upcoming fall and winter chili season," said Johnson.

"We continue to see very good demand for our value-added protein products that are sold through our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments.  Items like our fully cooked entrees, party trays and tray pack items reported double-digit growth.  Also, our case-ready business reported outstanding growth, with volume up 40 percent," Johnson said.

"The integration of the four acquisitions that were completed this year, Farmer John, Mexican Accent, Mark-Lynn Foods and Lloyd's Barbeque Company, continues to go well.  We are very pleased the way these businesses fit into the Hormel Foods organization and the contributions they made in the quarter," commented Johnson.  "We continue to explore additional opportunities that would complement our portfolio," said Johnson.
 
"The outlook for our business looks good going into the fourth quarter.  Even though last year's fourth quarter included an extra week, solid performance from all segments should enable us to deliver improved results for the quarter compared to a year ago," Johnson said.
 
"After assessing industry factors and our business plans and prospects, our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is in a range of $.50 to $.56 per share.  For the full year of fiscal 2005, we are tightening our earnings guidance from $1.70 - $1.80 to $1.73 - $1.79," Johnson concluded.

Operating profit totaled $27 million compared to $8 million last year.  The higher operating profit resulted from a combination of value-added sales growth, lower feed costs and efficiencies in our production facilities.
 - 
                 
 
Specialty Foods (10% of Net Sales, 8% of  Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Dollar sales increased 16 percent to $133 million.
 -

 - 
                 
Integration of Mark-Lynn on target.
 - 
                 
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 5% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Dollar sales down 5 percent to $48 million.  Year-ago results included $7 million of sales from Vista International Packaging, which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.  Excluding Vista, this year's dollar sales were up 11 percent, driven by strong export sales of fresh pork.  Dan's Prize also reported double-digit growth.
 - 
                 
Volume was down 3 percent compared with last year.
 -

 - 
                 
 
Net Interest and Investment Income/General Corporate Expense
Net interest and investment income improved in 2005 due to a $3.2 million increase in the Rabbi Trust return compared to a year ago.
 - 
                 
General corporate expenses were higher in 2005 because of the $18.1 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Vista and a credit of $2.4 million for a reduction to post-retirement benefits (Medicare Act of 2003) that occurred in 2004.
 -
