On November 8, 2005, the Company issued a press release raising its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 ending October 30, 2005.  The text of the press release follows:
 
"AUSTIN, MINN., November 8, 2005 (BUSINESS WIRE) - Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL) today reported that it expects fully diluted GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter ending October 30, 2005 to be in the range of $.56 - $.59 per share.  This is an increase from the previous guidance range of $.50 - $.56.
 
Better-than-expected results from the Jennie-O Turkey Store and Grocery Products segments were the key areas that enabled us to increase our guidance,' said Joel W. Johnson, chairman of the board and chief executive officer.
 
Exceptional market conditions and good growth from value-added products within the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment delivered better-than-expected results for the quarter.  Also, strong demand for key brands within the Grocery Products segment benefited the quarter beyond our expectations.  We will provide more details about the quarter and the fiscal 2006 outlook on Wednesday, November 23, 2005 when we release our fourth quarter earnings,' Johnson concluded.
