Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 31, 2006, stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Hormel Foods Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan").
 
The Plan was originally approved by the Company's stockholders at its 2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  When initially adopted, the Plan authorized the issuance of up to 4,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company, which number of shares was automatically doubled by operation of Section 4(c) of the Plan as a result of the Company's 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effected in 2000.  The Company expects to fully utilize the original share authorization during the 2006 fiscal year of the Company.  Therefore, Section 4(a) of the Plan has been amended to increase the number of shares of the Company common stock authorized to be issued thereunder by 10,000,000, from 9,000,000 to 19,000,000.  All other terms and conditions of the Plan remain in effect.
 
The purpose of the Plan is to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by aiding the Company in attracting and retaining employees, officers, and nonemployee directors capable of assuring the future success of the Company, to offer such persons incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the Company's business and to afford such persons an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company by rewarding them for making major contributions to the success of the Company, thereby aligning the interests of such personnel and directors with the Company's stockholders.
 
A copy of the Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

 (i)
          
Restrictions
 
.

Section 9.  General Provisions
 
.  No Eligible Person, Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Persons, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan.  The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to any Participant or with respect to different Participants.
(a)
          
No Rights to Awards
 
.  No Participant will have rights under an Award granted to such Participant unless and until an Award Agreement shall have been duly executed on behalf of the Company and, if requested by the Company, signed by the Participant.
(b)
          
Award Agreements
 
.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
(c)
          
No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements
 
.  The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate, nor will it affect in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate such employment at any time, with or without cause.  In addition, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment free from any liability or any

claim under the Plan or any Award, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement.
 
.  The validity, construction and effect of the Plan or any Award, and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan or any Award, shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
(e)
          
Governing Law
 
.  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction or Award, and the remainder of the Plan or any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
(f)
           
Severability
 
.  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person.  To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.
(g)
          
No Trust or Fund Created
 
.  No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash shall be paid in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.

No Fractional Shares
 
.  Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference.  Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
