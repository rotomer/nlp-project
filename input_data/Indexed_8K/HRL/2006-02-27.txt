Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL), the multinational marketer of consumer-branded meat and food products, today reported fiscal 2006 first quarter net earnings of $69.3 million, up 7 percent from earnings of $64.6 million a year earlier.  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $.50 this year compared to $.46 per share last year and sales totaled $1.4 billion, up from $1.3 billion in fiscal 2005.
 
Pretax earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 included a $9.2 million charge ($.04 per share) for the adoption of SFAS 123(R) (Share-Based Payment) and a $7.3 million charge ($.03 per share) for expenses relating to non-qualified plan settlements due to executive retirements.  Approximately $12 million of this total is reflected in General Corporate Expense, and the balance within the segments.  The effective tax rate was lower because of a $3.4 million after tax ($.02 per share) discrete tax benefit that was recognized in the first quarter.  The combined effect of these items reduced earnings per share by $.05.
COMMENTARY
 
"We are off to a good start in fiscal 2006," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, president and chief executive officer.  "The balanced strength of our business allowed us to deliver top and bottom line growth for the quarter, even though we faced considerably higher energy and freight costs.  Continued strong performance from Jennie-O Turkey Store and significant improvement from the Specialty Foods segment were key drivers behind our solid first quarter results," Ettinger stated.
 
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store (19% of Net Sales, 32% of Total Operating Profit)
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store benefited from high turkey meat markets, lower feed costs and value-added sales growth.  While overall tonnage for the segment was lower due to planned reductions in harvest, value-added volume was up 9 percent.  Sales dollars were up 2 percent despite a reduction in volume due to the higher markets and improved mix.  All three channels of value-added products, retail, foodservice and deli reported growth.  Products/categories within these channels reporting growth include Oven Ready items, frozen turkey burgers, traypack and rotisserie products.
 
Refrigerated Foods (53% of Net Sales, 29% of Total Operating Profit)
 
Refrigerated Foods delivered 3 percent higher operating profit driven by the contributions from last year's acquisitions and growth in key categories like refrigerated entrees, flavored meats and party trays.  Sales dollars without acquisitions were down due to lower markets compared to last year.     Foodservice volume was up 6 percent led by growth in the bacon category with items like smoked and bacon.  The sliced meats category also reported double-digit growth driven by the beef and ham items.  Case ready products sold through the Precept Foods joint venture reported exceptional growth in the quarter. The national roll-out of luncheon meats, which were introduced in the first quarter, has received outstanding acceptance by our customers and shipments began in February.

Grocery Products (14% of Net Sales, 26% of Total Operating Profit)
 
The Grocery Products segment reported mixed results with higher sales but lower operating profits.  Higher costs associated with beef and freight more than off-set the benefit received from lower pork input costs.  The microwave category continued to deliver excellent growth and we are expanding our production capabilities to meet demand.  The ethnic line of products also reported growth, while chili sales were down in the quarter due to a difficult year-ago comparison.
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 8% of Total Operating Profit)
 
Specialty Foods reported improved results across all business units and delivered profitability at levels that are expected to continue.  The Mark-Lynn Foods acquisition that was completed in 2005 was an important contributor in the quarter.  Other areas contributing to these results include sugar substitutes, sugar, liquid portions, ingredients and nutritional products.
All Other (3% of Net Sales, 5% of Total Operating Profit)
 
The All Other segment operating profit improvement was driven by the International operating segment.  Export sales of fresh pork and the family of productsas well as improved profitability from the China operations were the biggest areas of operating profit improvement.  Sales and volume were down from discontinuing unprofitable fresh pork export sales.

General
 
General Corporate Expense was up as a result of the adoption of  SFAS 123(R) and the non-qualified plan settlements as previously mentioned.
 
The Net Interest and Investment Income was a larger expense because of lower returns ($2.5 million) on the Rabbi Trust.
 
Effective with the first quarter, the company changed its accounting method for inventory from LIFO (Last-In First-Out) to FIFO (First-In First-Out).  The net pretax effect to the fiscal 2005 first quarter results was a positive $255,000.  All prior year information has been restated for the retrospective application of the change in accounting method.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"Looking ahead, we believe that lower pork markets will benefit our value-added processed items in Refrigerated Foods and certain items in Grocery Products.  On the flip side, cost factors that could pressure profitability are higher beef, freight and energy costs.  Also, as expected, we are starting to see higher levels of egg sets and poult placements in the turkey industry that we expect will result in more turkeys coming to market in the late summer/early fall.  After assessing these factors, along with our expectation of continued success in growing our value-added portfolio, our GAAP earnings guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 is in a range of $.42 to $.48 per share, up from $.40 per share in Q2 of fiscal 2005.  For the full year of fiscal 2006, we are increasing our GAAP earnings per share guidance from a range of $1.86 - $1.96 to a range of $1.90 - $2.00," Ettinger concluded.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
Effective February 15, 2006, the company paid its 310 consecutive quarterly dividend.  The annual rate is $.56 per share.
