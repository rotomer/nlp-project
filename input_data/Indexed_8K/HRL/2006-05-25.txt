COMMENTARY
 
"We delivered outstanding results in the second quarter despite the headwinds of a difficult protein environment and significantly higher energy costs," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, president and chief executive officer.   "Our ability to deliver a 20 percent increase in earnings in light of these conditions is a testament to our continued focus on growing our value-added product lines and on combating cost pressures by achieving improved operating efficiencies in our plants and supply chain areas.  Our balanced portfolio delivered increased top-line results in all five segments and improved operating profit in four out of five segments," Ettinger stated.
 
"The value-added areas in the Refrigerated Foods segment benefited from lower pork input costs and reported solid growth.  The Specialty Foods and All Other segments continued their strong performance from the first quarter and the Grocery Products segment reported impressive growth in microwave tray items, bacon bits and the family of products.  As expected, Jennie-O Turkey Store reported lower operating profit because of a difficult comparison in the prior year," said Ettinger, "but still delivered an operating profit margin of over 10 percent.

"To further enhance our portfolio, we acquired Valley Fresh, Inc., located in Turlock, California, during the second quarter.  Valley Fresh has the leading market share in the canned ready-to-eat chicken category and is a great complement to our existing canned ready-to-eat line of chicken, ham and turkey products," Ettinger concluded.

SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
 
Grocery Products (15% of Net Sales, 28% of Total Operating Profit)
 
The Grocery Products segment reported improved operating profit, net sales and volume because of contributions from several areas. The category reporting the best growth within the segment was the microwave tray category.  Additional capacity was added in the second quarter to help keep up with the microwave tray demand.  Other growth areas were bacon bits, chili and the family of products.   The Mexican Accent and Valley Fresh acquisitions also made positive contributions.  Lower pork costs improved the profitability of the family of products and bacon bit items.  Higher costs associated with imported beef raw materials and freight offset some of the benefit received from lower pork input costs.  The Valley Fresh acquisition integration is on track and meeting expectations.

Refrigerated Foods (51% of Net Sales, 29% of Total Operating Profit)
 
Refrigerated Foods reported 25 percent higher operating profit driven by key retail categories like barbeque meats, hams, sliced meats and deli items.  Foodservice pizza toppings and premium bacon items were also key contributors to the higher operating profit.  The increase in volume was driven by Foodservice and the processed meat items sold by the Meat Products business unit.  Sales, net of acquisitions, were flat with last year because of lower pork market conditions. The progress of case-ready sales continues to be encouraging, with volume up 75 percent in the quarter. The national roll-out of luncheon meats is going very well.  We will begin to support this line of great tasting, all natural products with aggressive advertising in the third quarter now that we have distribution throughout the United States.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (19% of Net Sales, 24% of Total Operating Profit)
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store reported lower operating profits primarily from higher feed and energy costs in the live production area.   Overall volume was down 4 percent from a reduction in the number of live birds processed and lower commodity sales.  Value-added volume grew 12 percent in the quarter with contributions coming from the retail, deli and foodservice channels.  The value-added sales increase was significant enough to improve overall net sales by 2 percent, despite lower volume of commodity sales. Products/categories reporting growth include Oven Ready items, frozen turkey burgers, deli and rotisserie products.  Four flavor varieties of a new sliced smoked turkey breast product in a re-useable plastic tub were launched in the second quarter with very positive initial results.  This line of products will continue to be rolled out in the third quarter.  Turkey meat markets were mixed, with breast meat higher and thigh meat lower than a year ago.  Egg sets and poult placements continue to trend above prior year.  For this reason, we expect more turkey supply coming to market over the next few quarters compared to a year ago.
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 11% of Total Operating Profit)
 
Specialty Foods reported significantly higher profits and sales primarily driven by growth in core packet sales of sugar substitutes, sugar and liquid portions.  Other areas contributing to the results include canned meat and ingredient items. Most of the growth is coming from better distribution with existing customers.  The addition of Mark-Lynn Foods added important items to the portfolio so a more complete line of products can be offered.  The improved product mix also increased the operating profit margin to 7.8 percent from 6.0 percent last year.
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 8% of Total Operating Profit)
 
The All Other segment improvement in sales and operating profit was driven by the International operating segment.  Export sales of the family of products were up 37 percentand continued improvement from the China operations were the biggest contributors.

General
 
The Net Interest and Investment Income was a lower expense by $2.4 million primarily from higher returns on the Rabbi Trust.
 
Effective with the first quarter, the company changed its accounting method for inventory from LIFO (Last-In First-Out) to FIFO (First-In First-Out).  The net pretax effect to the fiscal 2005 second quarter results was a positive $255,000.  All prior year information has been restated for the retrospective application of the change in accounting method.
OUTLOOK
 
"Given our expectation of continued success in growing our value-added portfolio and an anticipated benefit from the Valley Fresh acquisition, we are increasing our GAAP earnings per share guidance for the full year of fiscal 2006 from a range of $1.90 - $2.00, to a range of $1.94 - $2.04.  Our GAAP earnings guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 is in a range of $0.39 - $0.45 per share, up from $0.37 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.  We are expecting difficult comparisons for the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment in the second half, but we anticipate that our other segments will continue to generate growth in sales and operating profit commensurate with this guidance," Ettinger concluded.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
Effective May 15, 2006, the company paid its 311 consecutive quarterly dividend.  The annual rate is $.56 per share.
