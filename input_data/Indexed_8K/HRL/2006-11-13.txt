"AUSTIN, MINN.,  Nov. 10, 2006 (BUSINESS WIRE) Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL) today reported that it expects fully diluted GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter ending Oct. 29, 2006 to be in the range of $.63 - $.65 per share.  This is an increase from the previous guidance range of $.57 - $.63.  The new full year range is $2.04 - $2.06, an increase from the previous guidance range of $1.98 - $2.04.
I was pleased to see a stronger than expected finish from several areas of our business,' said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, president and chief executive officer.  In particular, our Specialty Foods segment had an exceptional finish to an outstanding year.  On the protein side of the business, our Foodservice results for both pork and turkey were better than expected,' Ettinger stated.
After assessing the industry factors and our business plans and prospects for fiscal 2007, we are also providing a fiscal 2007 guidance range of $2.15 - $2.25 per share.  While the higher grain markets are expected to be a burden to our business in 2007, we are excited about the growth opportunities from our value-added business.  We will provide more details about the quarter and the fiscal 2007 outlook on Wednesday, Nov. 22, 2006, when we release our fourth quarter earnings,' Ettinger concluded.
