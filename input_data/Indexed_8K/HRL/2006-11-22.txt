COMMENTARY
"The combination of very good execution by our employees and the strength of our product portfolio provided a strong finish to a great year," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.  "Our Specialty Foods segment was the clear standout delivering an 81 percent increase in operating profit for the quarter and 78 percent increase for the year," Ettinger continued.  "While the Specialty Foods segment had the most impressive results for the quarter, the rest of our business also delivered solid results, including our pork, turkey and beef foodservice businesses, Refrigerated Foods retail items, and our International business unit," Ettinger commented.
"Heading into the fourth quarter, we were facing difficult comparisons because of the exceptional results delivered by Jennie-O Turkey Store last year.  While our turkey business fell short of last year's results, the strength of our other businesses more than offset the shortfall.   Our strategy to create a faster-growing, better-balanced and more diversified business continues to deliver results," Ettinger stated.
"After the end of the quarter, we completed two small transactions that fit our strategy for future growth," Ettinger said.  "The first transaction was the purchase of Saag's Products, Inc. for approximately $12 million cash plus the assumption of certain obligations.  Saag's is a premium-quality gourmet sausage and specialty smoked meats processing business located in the San Francisco Bay Area, with annual sales of approximately $18 million dollars.  The second transaction was a joint venture agreement with San Miguel Corporation for a hog production and processing business in Vietnam, strengthening our presence in Asia.  Our investment was approximately $20 million," Ettinger concluded.
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  FOURTH QUARTER
Grocery Products (16% of Net Sales, 31% of Total Operating Profit)
The microwave tray line of products, bacon bits and the products were the key drivers behind the improved sales and operating profit for the Grocery Products segment.  The microwave products are the ultimate in convenience and fit perfectly with consumers' busy lifestyles.  We are very excited about the growth prospects for these items.  The integration of Valley Fresh is on target and nearing completion.  This business has been a great addition to our portfolio and has delivered immediate benefits to the bottom line.   Lower sales were reported for the family of products, and chili and canned items.

Refrigerated Foods (49% of Net Sales, 26% of Total Operating Profit)
Strong results were reported by both the Foodservice and Meat Products (retail) business units.  In the foodservice channel, pizza toppings and other value added items like Applewood smoked bacon, ethnic products and all had double-digit growth. On the retail side, strong growth was reported by sliced pepperoni, party trays, refrigerated entrees, flavored meats and products.  The national rollout of deli sandwich meats continues to meet expectations.  The Refrigerated Foods results were reduced by a $4 million charge for the write-down of the Houston, TX plant.  The plant has been closed and will be sold.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (20% of Net Sales, 25% of Total Operating Profit)
Jennie-O Turkey Store reported lower operating profits primarily from higher input costs (meat purchases from the outside) compared to last year.  Overall volume was up 1 percent, with value-added volume growing 7 percent and commodity sales down 6 percent. Foodservice and deli reported the best value-added growth with items such as turkey burgers and rotisserie turkey.  In the retail channel, the tub luncheon meat gained new distribution.  The turkey industry continued to be in very good shape in the fourth quarter because of strong demand and moderate supply growth.  Live turkey production is expected to increase in 2007 based on the current egg set and poult placement data.
JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 10% of Total Operating Profit)
The results for Specialty Foods were exceptional, reporting an 81 percent increase in operating profits driven by sales growth and improved product mix.  Higher sales and operating profits were reported by all three businesses within the Specialty Foods segment, including Diamond Crystal Brands, Hormel Specialty Products and Century Foods International.  Products that drove the growth were sugar substitutes, food ingredients, and ready-to-drink items. While the top and bottom line growth for this segment are expected to be above average next year, we do not anticipate the same level of growth that was achieved in 2006.
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 8% of Total Operating Profit)
The All Other segment increased sales by 18 percent and operating profit by 35 percent.  The two operating segments, International and Dan's Prize, both reported outstanding results.  Export sales were up 15 percent driven by sales of the family of productsand the China operations continued to report strong top and bottom line improvement.

OUTLOOK
"Fiscal 2006 was another successful year for Hormel Foods because of the hard work and dedication of our employees," Ettinger commented.  "Despite the challenges of higher energy costs and a volatile protein market, we were able to deliver the third consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth," Ettinger continued.

"As we look forward to 2007, we are cautiously optimistic. While we anticipate higher grain costs to be a burden in our turkey operation, we believe that our value-added initiatives will more than offset this extra expense.  We will continue our leadership role as an innovator in the food industry and we are excited about the growth prospects for our business.  Based on our current expectations for 2007, our guidance range is $2.15 - $2.25 per share for the full year and $.52 - $.58 per share for the first quarter," Ettinger concluded.
