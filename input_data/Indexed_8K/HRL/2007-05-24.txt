COMMENTARY
"We delivered excellent top line results across all five of our business segments and double-digit increases in operating profit performance in four out of the five segments" said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.  "Our microwaveable meals, led by microwavable trayscontinued their exceptional growth trend and we also enjoyed strong sales results from other key products such as chili, deli sandwich meats, and party trays," Ettinger said. "The only disappointment in the quarter was that Jennie-O Turkey Store

was not able to pass on higher grain costs through pricing as quickly or as thoroughly as we had hoped," Ettinger stated.
"Overall, our balanced model helped to stabilize earnings for the company even when one of our segments experienced a difficult operating environment," Ettinger concluded.
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  SECOND QUARTER
Grocery Products (15% of Net Sales, 33% of Total Operating Profit)
The Grocery Products segment reported an 11 percent increase in net sales and 28 percent increase in operating profit compared to last year.  The microwave tray line of products, which has been re-positioned as , continued to deliver exceptional growth.  Retailers continue to expand their shelf-space for these convenient meal solutions, as they are a perfect fit for today's consumers.  and chili were also key contributors to the segment's growth.  The repositioning of back to a regional brand has proven to be a good move.  This has provided more focused marketing programs within core region.  chili reported double-digit sales growth through more effective trade and marketing programs.  The line of canned chicken products also was an important contributor.  A price increase was announced during the second quarter that took effect April 30 for certain products within the Grocery Products segment.

Refrigerated Foods (53% of Net Sales, 37% of Total Operating Profit)
The Refrigerated Foods segment reported an 11 percent increase in sales and a 23 percent increase in operating profit for the quarter. Strong pork packer margins (the spread between live hog costs and meat values) was a benefit to the quarter. Also, Foodservice and Farmer John were two key contributors.  Foodservice products posting strong results include premium pork, productsand Applewood smoked bacon.   Farmer John reported strong results from foodservice sliced meats and precooked bacon.  The Meat Products business unit delivered solid top line growth behind products including sliced pepperoni, products, flavored meats and party trays.  The new items launched last quarter continue to gain distribution.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (18% of Net Sales, 12% of Total Operating Profit)
Operating profit for the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment was down 48 percent, even though sales were up 6 percent.  Higher grain costs were the key reason for the short-fall.  While price increases were implemented in the quarter, they were not enough to off-set the higher grain costs.  Additional price increases will be implemented in the second half of the year.  In the second quarter, sales of value-added products grew 9 percent with growth in all channels: retail, food service and deli.  Products reporting the strongest growth include Oven Ready whole turkey and breasts, turkey burgers and rotisserie turkey items.

Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 14% of Total Operating Profit)
The Specialty Foods segment had another strong quarter with operating profits up 33 percent compared to the second quarter last year.  Each of the three business units, including Hormel Specialty Products, Diamond Crystal Brands, and Century Foods International, once again delivered solid top and bottom line growth.  A favorable product mix shift was a key driver during the quarter including increased sales of specialty ingredients and nutritional products.  Continued improvement in capacity utilization across the segment also contributed to the higher profits.
All Other (3% of Net Sales, 4% of Total Operating Profit)
The All Other segment, which includes the International business unit, also had an excellent second quarter with operating profits up 16 percent.  Strong export sales were again a key driver this quarter, with continued growth in chili, fresh pork, and foodservice products.  Worldwide demand for the family of products also contributed to the results of the segment.  The segment recorded increased net sales and tonnage in our China operations for the quarter though profitability was lower than last year due to higher commodity input costs.

Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate was higher than our expected rate of 35.5 percent due to a $1.6 million ($.01 per share) charge for discrete events related to prior period audits.
OUTLOOK
"We are pleased with the strong performance and momentum of the majority of our business segments.  Jennie-O Turkey Store will continue to face the challenge of recovering significantly higher input costs through pricing.   Because the full extent and timing as to the implementation of their price increases remains unclear, we are modestly lowering our fiscal 2007 guidance from $2.15 - $2.25 to $2.12 - $2.22.  Our guidance range for the third quarter of 2007 is $0.42 - $0.48 per share," Ettinger concluded.
