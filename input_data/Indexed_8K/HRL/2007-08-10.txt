Other Events
On August 9, 2007, the Company issued a press release to lower its earnings guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 ending July 29, 2007, and to provide earnings guidance for the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and full year.  The text of the press release follows:
"Austin, Minn., Aug. 9, 2007  Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL), a multinational marketer of consumer-branded meat and food products, today said it expects its third quarter earnings to be $0.40 - $0.42 per share, down from a previous range of $0.42 - $0.48 per share.
Higher than expected input costs (beef, pork, chicken) within our Grocery Products segment was the primary reason for the short-fall in our third quarter results,' said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.  While we implemented a price increase in our Grocery Products segment at the beginning of the quarter, it was not enough to off-set the higher input costs.  We still expect the Grocery Products segment results to be comparable to last year and all of the other segments to meet expectations,' Ettinger stated.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to see earnings pressure from higher input costs.  For this reason, we are issuing fourth quarter guidance in a range of $0.62 - $0.68 per share, and updating the full year to $2.05 - $2.13 per share, down from $2.12 - $2.22 previously announced.  We will provide more details regarding the quarter and outlook during our conference call on August 23 at 9:30 a.m. CT,' Ettinger concluded.
