COMMENTARY
 
"It was a solid quarter for Hormel Foods. We were able to meet our company objectives for sales and earnings growth in the second quarter amidst a challenging operating environment," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. "Our Refrigerated Foods segment led the way, as lower pork input costs combined with increased sales of value-added products provided a significant increase in earnings. Our Grocery Products segment also delivered higher than expected sales and earnings, aided by strong sales of the family of products and continued growth of the product line."

"Jennie-O Turkey Store reported a significant decline in earnings as a result of a continued run-up in grain and fuel costs. The Specialty Foods segment also reported a decline in earnings, as a
result of increased input and fuel costs. Our International segment had another excellent quarter, posting double-digit increases in dollar sales and earnings, primarily attributable to strong export sales of the family of products and fresh pork. Overall, our balanced model helped to stabilize earnings for the company even when two of our segments experienced a difficult operating environment."

SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  SECOND QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (15% of Net Sales, 32% of Total Operating Profit)
 
The Grocery Products segment reported a 6 percent increase in operating profit compared to last year. The family of products had another strong quarter with higher sales and profits due to improved promotional support, national media efforts and expanded distribution of Singles. Sales of microwave mealschili and stew also increased in the quarter. Sales of products were down due to competitive pressures. Sales of ethnic products also declined due to lower volumes of sauces and the rationalization of low margin business.

Refrigerated Foods (52% of Net Sales, 43% of Total Operating Profit)
 
The Refrigerated Foods segment had a strong quarter with operating profit up 26 percent compared to fiscal 2007. Lower hog input costs compared to last year led to higher margins in both value-added products and fresh pork. Sales and volumes also improved in key retail product lines such as deli meats and refrigerated entrees. Volumes in the Foodservice business unit were flat for the quarter. We have been able to offset some lost volumes in the casual dining segment by pursuing other channels. The acquisition of Burke Corporation also positively contributed to the second quarter results.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (18% of Net Sales, 9% of Total Operating Profit)
 
Operating profit declined 16 percent in the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment in the quarter despite an 8 percent increase in sales. Grain-related costs were $39 million higher compared to fiscal 2007. The increase in corn prices during the second quarter added a new layer of costs that were not fully recovered. Given the current market dynamics, we will be reducing our poult placements in our grow-out facilities by approximately 5%. We will also continue to pursue manufacturing efficiencies, customer and product rationalization, and pricing to improve profitability. Sales of value-added retail products continued to grow during the quarter, led by fresh tray pack, turkey burgers and marinated tenders. This helped offset softer sales of certain other value-added retail products, including pan roasts and turkey franks.
 
Specialty Foods (12% of Net Sales, 12% of Total Operating Profit)
 
The Specialty Foods segment reported operating profits down 5 percent compared to fiscal 2007.  Better results at the Century Foods International business unit from higher sales of nutritional jar and ready-to-drink products did not offset declines in the other business units. Profits declined in the Specialty Products business unit due to higher input costs and lower sales volumes of dry sausage. Diamond Crystal Brands was adversely affected by higher input costs and lower volumes.
All Other (3% of Net Sales, 4% of Total Operating Profit)
 
The All Other segment, which includes the International business unit, had another excellent quarter with operating profits up 20 percent.  Export sales and margins continued to be strong throughout the quarter, particularly for the family of products and fresh pork. Operating results in our China operations declined due to continued high hog input costs and lower export volumes.

OUTLOOK
 
"We are reconfirming our fiscal 2008 guidance range of $2.30-$2.40 per share. Although we hope to build on our solid first half results, we anticipate further pressure from increasing grain and energy costs. We also face some uncertainty regarding protein input costs. The strength of our core businesses, the growth of our value-added products and the ability of our people to adapt to changes in the business environment should allow us to meet our goals," Ettinger said.
 
DIVIDENDS
