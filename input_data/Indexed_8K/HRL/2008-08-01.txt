History and Purpose
 
HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (hereinafter, the "Company"), previously established a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan (the "Plan") which was first effective November 1, 1992. The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety effective November 1, 2002 (the "2002 Restatement"). The Plan was again amended and restated effective January 1, 2005 to comply with Section 409A of the Code. The 2005 Restatement applied solely to deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code (., deferred compensation credited under the Plan which related all or in part to services performed on or after January 1, 2005. Deferred compensation credited under the Plan which relates entirely to services performed on or before December 31, 2004 is "grandfathered" from application of Section 409A of the Code and continues to be governed by the rules of payment under the 2002 restatement, which are incorporated into Appendix A to this Plan Statement. All pre-409A payment elections made by the Participant with respect to the Participant's entire grandfathered Account Balance shall continue in effect unless modified by the Participant, in accordance with the rules of payment under Appendix A.
i.e
 
The Plan was subsequently restated effective January 1, 2008 to: (i) allow Participants to make separate payment elections with respect to each type of voluntary elective deferral (., Annual Deferral Amount) made with respect a Deferral Period ending on or after January 1, 2008 (whereas previously Participants made one payment election, upon commencement of participation, applicable to their entire Account Balance); (ii) permanently discontinue Profit Sharing Amounts with respect to fiscal years ending on or after October 27, 2007; and (iii) provide for a non-elective time and form of payment for all Annual Discretionary Contribution Amounts credit for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2008 (except with respect to a Change in Control Benefit). With respect to Annual Deferral Amounts made with respect to 2005 through 2007 Deferral Periods, the payment elections made by the Participant with respect to the Participant's entire 2005-2007 Account Balance shall continue in effect, and the terms of payment shall be governed by Appendix A.
i.e
 
The Plan is hereby again amended and restated, effective January 1, 2008, to allow Participants, during a limited period ending December 31, 2008, an opportunity to change the form of payment with respect to Retirement Benefit and Survivor Benefit elections for all amounts credited to the Plan that are subject to Section 409A of the Code (., generally, amounts deferred or contributed into the Plan on or after January 1, 2005) in accordance with special transition rules issued by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Treasury in connection with the implementation of Section 409A of the Code.
i.e
 
The purpose of this Plan is to provide specified benefits to a select group of management or highly compensated Employees who contribute materially to the continued growth, development and future business success of Hormel Foods Corporation and its Affiliates and/or subsidiaries, if any, that sponsor this Plan. This Plan shall be administered and construed so that it is unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA.

For this purpose, the "Company Controlled Group" is the Participant's Employer and all persons with whom the Employer would be considered a single employer under Code sections 414(b) and 414(c); provided that, in applying Code sections 1563(a)(1), (2) and (3) for purposes of determining a controlled group of corporations under Code section 414(b), the language "at least 50 percent" shall be used instead of "at least 80 percent" each place it appears therein, and in applying Treas.

If an Employer who is an Affiliate (i.e., not the Principal Sponsor) ceases to be an Affiliate because of a sale of substantially all the stock or assets of that Employer, then Participants who are employed by that Employer and who cease to be employed by that Employer in connection with the sale of substantially all the stock or assets of that Employer shall be deemed to have thereby had a Termination of Employment for the purposes of commencing distributions from this Plan.
i.e
 
1.49
        
"Trust" shall mean one or more trusts established pursuant to that certain Master Trust Agreement between the Principal Sponsor and the trustee named therein, as amended from time to time.

1.51
        
"Years of Service" shall mean the total number of full years in which a Participant has been employed by one or more Employers.

(c)
          
Designates one or more Beneficiaries and all such Beneficiaries so designated fail to survive the Participant,
 
such Participant's Account Balance, or the part thereof as to which such Participant's designation fails, as the case may be, shall be payable to the first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries with a member surviving the Participant and (except in the case of surviving issue) in equal shares if there is more than one member in such class surviving the Participant:

Any disclaimer must be in writing and must be executed personally by the Beneficiary before a notary public.  A disclaimer shall state that the Beneficiary's entire interest in the undistributed Account Balance is disclaimed or shall specify what portion thereof is disclaimed.  To be effective, duplicate original executed copies of the disclaimer must be both executed and actually delivered to the Committee after the date of the Participant's death but not later than forty-five (45) days after the date of the Participant's death.

The Committee shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported disclaimer.  Upon the filing of a valid disclaimer, the Beneficiary shall be considered not to have survived the Participant as to the interest disclaimed.  A disclaimer by a Beneficiary shall not be considered to be a transfer of an interest in violation of the provisions in Section 19.4 and shall not be considered to be an assignment or alienation of benefits in violation of federal law prohibiting the assignment or alienation of benefits under this Plan.  No other form of attempted disclaimer shall be recognized by the Committee.

The automatic Beneficiaries specified in Section 12.2 and the Beneficiaries designated by the Participant shall become fixed at the time of the Participant's death so that, if a Beneficiary survives a Participant but dies before receipt of the payment due such Beneficiary hereunder, such payment shall be payable to the representative of such Beneficiary's estate.
 
(c)
                                
If the Participant designates as a Beneficiary the person who is the Participant's spouse on the date of the designation, either by name or by relationship, or both, the dissolution, annulment or other legal termination of the marriage between the Participant and such person shall automatically revoke such designation.  (The foregoing shall not prevent the Participant from designating a former spouse as a Beneficiary on the Beneficiary Designation Form executed by the Participant and received by the Committee after the date of the legal termination of the marriage between the Participant and such former spouse, and during the Participant's lifetime.)
 
(d)

(e)
                                
Any designation of a Beneficiary only by statement of relationship to the Participant shall be effective only to designate the person or persons standing in such relationship to the Participant at the Participant's death.
 
A Beneficiary designation is permanently void if it either is executed or is filed by a Participant who, at the time of such execution or filing, is then a minor under the law of the state of the Participant's legal residence.  The Committee shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported Beneficiary designation.
