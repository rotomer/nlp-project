COMMENTARY
 
"We continue to generate strong top-line growth in both dollar sales and volume across all five of our operating segments," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. "As we previously announced, the higher feed input and fuel costs at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment pressured profitability and contributed to the year over year decline in the company's third quarter results. Relatively flat results in our Refrigerated Foods segment and a decline in investment income also presented unanticipated challenges during the quarter. In our Refrigerated Foods segment, strong fresh pork margins and pricing taken by our Meat Products and Foodservice Divisions were insufficient to overcome increased costs experienced by those divisions."
 
 
"We were encouraged by the strong top line and bottom line growth by our Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and All Other segments. Our Grocery Products and All Other segments maintained the strong momentum they had during the first half of the year, and our Specialty Foods segment rebounded nicely under difficult operating circumstances," Ettinger said.
 
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  THIRD QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (13% of Net Sales, 31% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Grocery Products segment reported an 11 percent increase in operating profit for the quarter compared to last year. The and chili products performed particularly well for the quarter due to improved retail promotional programs and gains over competitive brands. stews and microwave meals also achieved increases in sales this quarter.

Refrigerated Foods (53% of Net Sales, 38% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Refrigerated Foods segment reported an operating profit 1 percent lower than last year for the quarter. Higher input and other costs were not fully recovered through pricing actions. Sales were up 8 percent due to continued strong demand for value-added products, particularly in the retail segment. Retail product lines experiencing strong net sales growth include productsand pepperoni. Net sales were down slightly in the Foodservice division.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (19% of Net Sales, 8% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Operating profit declined 61 percent in the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment in the quarter despite an 11 percent increase in sales. While the Jennie-O Turkey Store team continued to implement price increases, these increases were not adequate to offset the approximately $53 million increase in feed and fuel input costs incurred during the quarter. An oversupply of turkey breast meat in the market also kept pricing of commodity breast meat at a low level, exacerbating the cost-price differential. Demand for retail value-added products such as turkey burgers and tray pack products continues to be strong.
JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 17% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Specialty Foods segment had strong results for the quarter with operating profit increasing 20 percent. Each of the three business units in this segment reported higher net sales and operating profits for the quarter. Gains in the Specialty Products business unit were driven by higher contract manufacturing volumes. Century Foods International experienced significantly higher sales and volumes of ready-to-drink products. Diamond Crystal Brands completed an acquisition of a small liquid packet manufacturer in Georgia during the quarter.
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 6% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The All Other segment, which includes the International business unit, had another strong quarter with operating profit up 19 percent compared to last year. Export sales of the family of products and fresh pork are the main contributors with increases being shown in most markets. Equity in earnings of affiliates declined for the quarter due to the impact of the weakening Philippine peso on results of our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture.

General Corporate Expense
 
General corporate expense decreased for the quarter due to lower than expected expenses associated with long-term compensation plans and other benefits.
 
Net Interest and Investment Income
 
Net interest and investment income declined significantly compared to last year due primarily to lower investment results on our rabbi trust investments, which fund the company's non-qualified benefit plan obligations.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"As stated in our preannouncement on August 8, we expect to see continued earnings pressure at Jennie-O Turkey Store from higher input costs, as the birds fed with higher grain prices make their way through the system. As stated previously, we are adjusting our full year guidance to $2.22-$2.28 per share, which is above our prior year results of $2.17 per share last year ($2.14 excluding the sale of assets in the fourth quarter). We continue to focus on our long-term objectives to grow the business through product innovation, increasing brand strength and adding value to our products," Ettinger said.
