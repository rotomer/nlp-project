COMMENTARY
 
"As we previously announced, the recent substantial decline in global financial markets negatively impacted our rabbi trust investment performance. This, along with greater than expected cost pressures and unfavorable product mix changes in our Grocery Products segment, required us to lower our guidance to $2.03 to $2.09 from our earlier guidance range of $2.22 to $2.28 per share" said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. "A better than expected finish by our Refrigerated Foods segment allowed us to come in at $2.08 per share, near the high end of our revised guidance range."
 
"The rabbi trust was established in 2003 to fund certain nonqualified supplemental executive retirement and deferred income plans. The trust assets are invested in equity and income securities and generally track the market. The trust assets are considered trading securities, accordingly, gains and losses are included in our quarterly earnings on a mark-to-market basis. These investment losses do not affect the company's cash flow, nor does the company have any obligation to recapitalize the trust funds," explained Ettinger.
 
"Despite strong sales of the family of products and other canned items, our Grocery Products segment had an off quarter. The lower results were driven primarily by higher beef and pork trim costs, but also as a result of a slowdown of our microwave meal business. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment continued to experience higher feed and fuel input costs during the quarter that they were unable to offset with increased pricing. An industry-wide over-supply of breast meat kept prices below our cost of production. We do not expect this situation will significantly improve until next spring," Ettinger stated.

"For the full year, we generated strong volume and sales increases across each of our segments. In addition, four of our five segments had earnings up from a year ago, and total segment operating profits were up six percent from a year ago. We continue to grow our sales of new value-added products and remain on track to meet our goal of $2 billion of new product sales by 2012," Ettinger commented.
 
"This morning we announced a $.02 per share increase to our annual dividend, making the new dividend $.76 per share. This is the 43rd consecutive year in which we've increased our dividend," Ettinger concluded.
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  FOURTH QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (14% of Net Sales, 28% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Grocery Products segment reported a 3 percent decrease in operating profit for the quarter compared to last year.  Higher input costs and an unfavorable sales mix contributed to the decline.  Sales of microwave meals also softened during the quarter, which appears to be consistent with trends in other convenient packaged meal segments.  On the positive side, sales of our family of products, chili andstewsexperienced double-digit increases during the quarter.

Refrigerated Foods (51% of Net Sales, 39% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Segment operating profit for the Refrigerated Foods segment increased 12 percent for the quarter, primarily attributable to an improved spread between hog costs and primal values.  The Meat Products business unit experienced increased sales for the quarter; however, pricing actions were unable to keep pace with rising input costs.  Operating results for the Foodservice division declined for the quarter due to an industry-wide softness in away-from-home dining.
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store (20% of Net Sales, 16% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store experienced a 44 percent decline in operating profit for the quarter. Commodity meat sales profitability continued to suffer as the oversupply of breast meat in the market did not allow for adequate offset of higher feed and fuel costs, which increased $40 million from the same period last year.
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 13% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Specialty Foods segment completed an exceptional quarter with sales, volume and segment operating profit all experiencing double digit increases.  The Specialty Products business unit achieved gains from contract packaging and savory products.  The third quarter acquisition of Boca Grande Foods, Inc. enhanced the results of Diamond Crystal Brands.  Century Foods International also achieved strong results, primarily with ready-to-drink products.
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 4% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The All Other segment, which includes the International business unit, achieved double-digit increases in both sales and tonnage, primarily due to strong exports of fresh pork and the family of products. In spite of these gains, operating profit for the quarter decreased 8 percent, due to higher than expected raw material costs and a stronger dollar.

General Corporate Expense
 
Excluding a $4.8 million pretax gain on the 2007 sale of a company aircraft, general corporate expenses are at a normalized level for the quarter.
Net Interest and Investment Income
 
Net interest and investment income in the quarter declined significantly compared to last year due primarily to lower investment results on our rabbi trust investments.  Additionally, fiscal year 2007 results reflect a $2.0 million pretax gain on the dissolution of our Patak's joint venture.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"Looking forward to 2009, we see both challenges and opportunities. The challenges we face include an oversupply of turkey breast meat and higher commodity costs at Jennie-O Turkey Store, the prospect of increasing hog prices as supply gradually declines, and the uncertain economic environment affecting consumer demand. Opportunities include the flexibility that our strong balance sheet provides, the success of our value-added products and the stability of our balanced model. We anticipate a slow start to fiscal year 2009, with difficult comparisons from the first half of fiscal year 2008, and the opportunity to finish strong in the second half of the year. After assessing these factors and our business plans and prospects for the upcoming year, we are setting our fiscal 2009 guidance range at $2.15 to $2.25 per share," Ettinger said.
 
"In light of tight capital markets and the pullback in consumer spending, we will continue to manage our capital conservatively, delaying any capital projects that are not time critical. Given the shift in consumer preferences, we now intend to use part of the capacity of the new Dubuque plant for additional production of canned products," concluded Ettinger.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
Effective Nov 15, 2008, the Company paid its 321 consecutive quarterly dividend. The annual rate was $.74.
