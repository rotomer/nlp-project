Section 5  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
 
 
On January 27, 2009, stockholders of Hormel Foods Corporation (the Company) approved the Hormel Foods Corporation 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan).
 
The Plan is designed to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by aiding the Company in attracting and retaining employees, officers, and nonemployee directors capable of assuring the future success of the Company, to offer such persons incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the Company's business, and to afford such persons an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company by rewarding them for making major contributions to the success of the Company.
 
The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (or other committee as designated by the Board of Directors) which has the authority to designate participants, to determine the types of awards to be granted to each participant, and to conduct all other actions necessary to administer the plan in accordance with Plan provisions and applicable law.  Eligible participants include any employee, officer, consultant, independent contractor, or Director providing services to the Company, or any affiliate whom the committee determines to be eligible based on their judgment as to that person's ability to have a significant effect on the success of the Company.  Awards under the Plan may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance awards based on the achievement of established performance goals, other stock grants, or other stock-based awards.
 
A copy of the Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
 
Item 5.03
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
Pursuant to a resolution approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on January 27, 2009, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to Section 16 of the Bylaws of Hormel Foods Corporation.
 
Section 16 is amended due to the addition of a Lead Director position on the Board of Directors, and allows the Lead Director to call special meetings of the Board on one day's notice to each Director.  Previously, such special meetings could only be called by the Chairman of the Board.

Shares Available
 
.  For purposes of this Section 4, if an Award entitles the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares, the number of Shares covered by such Award or to which such Award relates shall be counted on the date of grant of such Award against the aggregate number of Shares available for granting Awards under the Plan.  Awards that do not entitle the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares and Awards that are settled in cash shall not be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan.
(b)
                                
Accounting for Awards
 
.  In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is necessary in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares (or other
(c)

securities or other property) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards and (iii) the purchase or exercise price with respect to any Award; , , that the number of Shares covered by any Award or to which such Award relates shall always be a whole number.

With respect to Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Awards and/or Other Stock-Based Awards that are denominated in Shares, no Eligible Person may be granted any Awards for more than 200,000 Shares in the aggregate in any calendar year.  In addition to the foregoing, the maximum dollar value that may be paid to any Eligible Person in any calendar year with respect to Awards that are denominated in cash shall not exceed the Fair Market Value of 300,000 Shares, determined at the end of the applicable performance period.

Section 5.  Eligibility

In determining which Eligible Persons shall receive an Award and the terms of any Award, the Committee may take into account the nature of the services rendered by the respective Eligible Persons, their present and potential contributions to the success of the Company or such other factors as the Committee, in its discretion, shall deem relevant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to full or part-time employees (which term as used herein includes, without limitation, officers and Directors who are also employees), and an Incentive Stock Option shall not be granted to an employee of an Affiliate unless such Affiliate is also a "subsidiary corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code or any successor provision.

Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the grant price, term, methods of exercise, dates of exercise, methods of settlement and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right shall be as determined by the Committee.  The Committee may impose such conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem appropriate.
(b)
                                
Stock Appreciation Rights
 
.  The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units to Participants with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee shall determine:
(c)
                                 
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without limitation, any limitation on the right to vote a Share of Restricted Stock or the right to receive any dividend or other right or property with respect thereto), which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or times, in such installments or otherwise as the Committee may deem appropriate.
(i)

Shares representing Restricted Stock that is no longer subject to restrictions shall be delivered to the Participant promptly after the applicable restrictions lapse or are waived.  In the case of Restricted Stock Units, no Shares shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted.  Upon the lapse or waiver of restrictions and the restricted period relating to Restricted Stock Units evidencing the right to receive Shares, such Shares shall be issued and delivered to the holder of the Restricted Stock Units.
(ii)
                                 
Issuance and Delivery of Shares

(iii)
                              
Forfeiture

No Rights to Awards
