COMMENTARY
 
"We are pleased to report improved operating segment results for the quarter. Our Refrigerated Foods segment rebounded to post higher earnings on an enhanced sales mix and lower costs, despite weak cutout margins during much of the quarter. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment also showed continued improvement in the quarter," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.
"Our Grocery Products segment had another solid quarter, as increased sales of canned items more than offset the impact of discontinued sales of olive oil and soft sales of microwave products. Our Specialty Foods and All Other segments had weaker results," Ettinger remarked.
 
"Sales and volumes were down overall, as we made intentional reductions to our turkey production and the effects of the economy took their toll on certain portions of the business," Ettinger commented.
 
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  THIRD QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (13% of Net Sales, 26% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Grocery Products segment reported another good quarter with segment operating profit up 11 percent.  Strong sales of the family of products, chili and products more than offset the impact of soft sales of our microwaveable products.  Excluding sales of the recently discontinued Carapelli joint venture products, net sales for the Grocery Products segment were even with last year.
SPAM
HORMEL
HERDEZ
 
Refrigerated Foods (54% of Net Sales, 45% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Refrigerated Foods segment completed an outstanding quarter, with segment operating profits up 60 percent from last year, when primal values were exceptionally high, due to strong export demand.  Sales of our retail value-added offerings such as Pepperoni, Party Trays and the DiLusso Deli Company products more than offset the impact of a challenging pork environment.  Foodservice sales continued to be soft, reflecting a weak travel and recreation environment and a continued decline in the restaurant trade.
HORMEL
HORMEL
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store (19% of Net Sales, 12% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Total segment operating profit for Jennie-O Turkey Store improved 97 percent from last year's tough third quarter.  Lower feed expenditures due to the planned reduction of turkey production and a reduced cost per ton, were the primary drivers of the improved profitability. The reduced production helped offset the continued challenge of low commodity meat prices, by reducing our exposure to those markets.
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 13% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Segment operating profit for Specialty Foods was down 2 percent, reflecting mixed results within the segment.  Diamond Crystal Brands showed improved results due to strong sales of nutritional products.  However, these results were not sufficient to overcome weak sales of nutritional and ready-to-drink products at Century Foods International.
 
All Other (3% of Net Sales, 4% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The All Other segment, which includes Hormel Foods International, experienced a 19 percent decline in segment operating profit.  Continued currency headwinds and difficult export markets led to the weaker results.
 
Net Interest and Investment Income
Net interest and investment income for the quarter was significantly improved versus last year due primarily to more favorable returns on the rabbi trust investments.
 
General Corporate Expense
General corporate expenses increased from last year due to higher medical expenses and increased employee incentive plan costs.
OUTLOOK
 
"As a result of our strong third quarter results, we anticipate full year results in our recently announced range of $2.36 to $2.42 per share. Although we are faced with challenges including the weak economy, a continued excess supply of commodity turkey meat, and difficult export markets, our balanced business model, continued strength in our core franchise products, and our very committed team should allow us to deliver an excellent year," Ettinger concluded.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
Effective July 15, 2009, the Company paid its 324
th
 consecutive quarterly dividend. The annual rate is $.76.
