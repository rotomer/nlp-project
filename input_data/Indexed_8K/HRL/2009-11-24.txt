COMMENTARY
 
"We are pleased to report an excellent finish to fiscal 2009. All five business segments contributed to our third consecutive strong quarter, generating a 54 percent increase in EPS and a 17 percent increase in segment operating profit. We are happy to get back on track with our long-term record of earnings growth after a challenging year in 2008," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.
 
"Our Refrigerated Foods segment led the way with strong earnings resulting from an enhanced product mix bolstered by lower input costs. Our Grocery Products segment posted solid earnings results from lower year-over-year input costs for many items and behind the strength of increased sales and market share of our chili product line. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment benefitted from reduced production levels and lower input costs. A return to positive earnings comparisons by our Specialty Foods and All Other segments, lower freight and warehouse expenses across all of our business segments and improved investment income results also contributed to our strong earnings results," explained Ettinger.

"Although we are pleased with our earnings, we experienced disappointing sales in the fourth quarter. The decline in sales was attributable in part to lower commodity costs reflected in lower pricing in our pork and turkey complex, planned production reductions at Jennie-O Turkey Store, product rationalizations and some difficult comparisons from the prior year. In addition, we were also faced with a continued weak consumer environment that hampered sales efforts during the quarter," Ettinger remarked.
 
"For the full year, earnings per share grew 22 percent on a 3 percent reduction in sales. Four of our five segments posted increased segment operating profits over a year ago, and total operating profits increased 7 percent from a year ago," stated Ettinger.

"This morning, we announced an $.08 per share increase to our annual dividend rate (or 10.5%), making the new dividend $.84 per share. This is the 44

SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  FOURTH QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (14% of Net Sales, 27% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Grocery Products segment achieved strong segment profit results with an increase of 12 percent from 2008, as a result of favorable raw material and freight and warehouse variances. Strong sales of chili also contributed to the segment profit increase.  Sales declined as a result of a continued difficult consumer environment, particularly in the microwave product lines. The discontinued Carapelli joint venture comprised about a quarter of the sales decline, and increased promotional spending, difficult comparisons from a year ago and some product rationalization also contributed to the sales decline.
Hormel
 
Refrigerated Foods (51% of Net Sales, 41% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Refrigerated Foods delivered another excellent quarter, with segment operating profit up 23 percent versus last year.  Unfavorable spreads between hog costs and primal values were more than offset by a better product mix in both our Meat Products and Foodservice business units, as well as strong sales of such products as pepperoni, barbeque products, and the DiLusso Deli Company product lines.  Sales were softer overall, reflecting a weak foodservice sales environment and reduced prices of commodity pork, hams and bacon.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (20% of Net Sales, 14% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Total segment profit for Jennie-O Turkey Store improved 6 percent from last year. Lower feed expenditures due to the planned reduction of turkey production helped boost their segment profit.  The reduced production helped offset continued low commodity meat prices, by reducing our exposure to those markets. Sales of value-added products were constrained by challenging market conditions.
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 12% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Segment operating profit for Specialty Foods was up 9 percent, on mixed results within the segment. Strong private label performance by the Specialty Products business more than offset weak sales of nutritional and ready-to-drink products by Century Foods International.
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 6% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The All Other segment, which includes Hormel Foods International, surpassed last year's segment profit by 53 percent.  Profit improvement was achieved due to lower raw material and freight expenses, along with improved currency conditions.  Export markets remained challenging due to the continuing weak global economy.
 
Net Interest and Investment Income
Net interest and investment income improved $22.9 million from last year due to the significantly improved investment results of the company's rabbi trust investments.
 
General Corporate Expense
During the quarter, general corporate expenses were higher than last year due to higher employee compensation plan costs.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"Having returned to more normal earnings growth levels this year, we are confident in our ability to continue to enhance our bottom line.  We intend to tackle the challenge of a continued weak economy and reduced consumer spending, and expect to restore top-line growth on an annualized basis in 2010.  After assessing the important factors affecting our business for the upcoming year, we are setting our fiscal 2010 guidance range at $2.63 to $2.73 per share," stated Ettinger.
