COMMENTARY
 
"We are pleased to report excellent earnings and sales for the quarter, which were up 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively.  This quarter demonstrated the value of our balanced model, as our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Specialty Foods segments more than made up for the more difficult quarter experienced by our Grocery Products segment due to increased raw material costs. We are also gratified to see our sales grow in all five of our segments," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.
 
"Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had an outstanding quarter, showing strength across the board. Our Specialty Foods segment also enjoyed a strong quarter, aided by strong sales of nutritional products, sugar substitutes and private label canned meats. Our Refrigerated Foods segment had improved results, primarily resulting from strong cutout margins, and our International segment had weaker results," remarked Ettinger.
 
"We were pleased with the progress made with our new product lines under our MegaMex Foods venture and our side dish acquisition, as both product lines contributed to our results this quarter," commented Ettinger.

SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  SECOND QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (15% of Net Sales, 22% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Grocery Products segment experienced soft segment operating profit results, down 2 percent on an adjusted
1
 basis, due to higher protein costs.  Net sales exceeded last year by 6 percent, led by strong results from our core products, such as chili and hash.  Results from our MegaMex Foods business continue to meet expectations.
Hormel

Refrigerated Foods (53% of Net Sales, 38% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Despite the rapid rise in primal values during the quarter, the Refrigerated Foods segment exceeded last year's profitability by 7 percent, due primarily to stronger cutout margins.  Net sales for the quarter also increased 7 percent, with strong contributions from products such as party trays and pepperoni.  Positive contributions from our new business were also reflected in the results.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (17% of Net Sales, 22% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Jennie-O Turkey Store improved its segment operating profit results by a remarkable 93 percent from a year ago. Strength across the board, including stronger commodity meat markets and improved efficiencies contributed to the strong results. Sales of our value-added products rose in all three trade channels.
 
Specialty Foods (12% of Net Sales, 15% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Specialty Foods segment recorded an outstanding quarter, with segment profit up 39 percent from 2009.  Each business unit contributed to the increase, led by sales of sports nutrition products, private label canned meat products, and sugar substitutes.  Revenues overall also exceeded last year by 13 percent.

All Other (3% of Net Sales, 3% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The All Other segment, which includes Hormel Foods International, experienced an 18 percent decline in segment profit for the quarter.  This decline was due primarily to continued weakness in fresh pork exports resulting from decreased demand in our key markets.  Revenues for the segment exceeded last year, aided by strong sales of the family of products.

Net Interest and Investment Income
Lower net interest and investment income reflects a gain in 2009 on the dissolution of the Carapelli joint venture and current year lower returns on the rabbi trust investments.
 
General Corporate Expense
General corporate expenses were slightly lower than last year (down 2 percent).
 
OUTLOOK
 
"Excluding the 10 cent per share impact of the one-time charges relating to the closing of the Valley Fresh plant and the reduced value of the deferred tax asset resulting from the new health care laws, we are raising our full year guidance range from $2.68 to $2.78 per share to $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We anticipate continued higher hog costs during the remainder of the year, and we recognize the strong investment performance in our rabbi trust last year will result in a more difficult comparison in the back half of the year. However, we believe our strong brands and our dedicated team will allow us to overcome those obstacles," concluded Ettinger.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
Effective May 15, 2010, the Company paid its 327
th
 consecutive quarterly dividend, at the annual rate of $0.84.
