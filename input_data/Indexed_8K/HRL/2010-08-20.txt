COMMENTARY
 
"We are pleased to report strong earnings and sales this quarter, which were up 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively. We are gratified by the continued strong sales growth, particularly in our branded and value-added product portfolios. Earnings growth was attributable to segment profit gains in four of our five segments, led by Jennie-O Turkey Store. This segment had an excellent quarter, showing continued strength in all areas of the business," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.

"Our Refrigerated Foods segment had a strong quarter, benefiting from higher cutout margins, and our Specialty Foods segment continued its momentum this quarter on sales growth in all three of its business units. Our Grocery Products segment had a difficult quarter, hampered by higher raw material input costs," commented Ettinger.
 
"We continue to be pleased with the excellent progress made with our new product lines in both our MegaMex Foods business and our
Country Crock
side dish acquisition, both of which contributed to our positive results this quarter," remarked Ettinger.
 
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  THIRD QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (13% of Net Sales, 18% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Grocery Products segment profit declined 23 percent due primarily to higher raw material costs.  Net sales, however, increased 12 percent for the quarter, driven primarily by increased sales of MegaMex Foods products, and by continued strong sales of chili.
Hormel
 
Refrigerated Foods (55% of Net Sales, 44% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Refrigerated Foods delivered strong results, with double-digit increases achieved for both segment profit and net sales.  Lower returns due to higher raw material input costs in the value-added businesses were offset by strong pork operating margins.  Retail sales were strong, with notable increases achieved for the  party trays and barbeque products.  A nice contribution was made by the recently acquired  side dish products, as well.
Hormel
Lloyd's
Country Crock
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store (17% of Net Sales, 21% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store completed an outstanding third quarter, with segment profit 93 percent greater than last year.  Overall improvement in operating efficiencies along with favorable commodity pricing contributed to the increased profitability.  Net sales for the quarter were flat, due to lower commodity meat sales. However, year-over-year increases of sales occurred in each of the value-added businesses.
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 14% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Specialty Foods segment posted excellent third quarter results, with positive contributions from each of the three business units.  Results were led by sales of sports nutrition products, private label canned products and sugar products. Overall sales revenues increased by 12 percent.
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 3% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Segment profit for the All Other Segment, which consists primarily of Hormel Foods International, was up slightly for the third quarter.  Strong export sales of the  family of products were largely offset by higher raw material costs during the quarter.
SPAM
 
Net Interest and Investment Income
 
Net interest and investment income was significantly lower this quarter, as expected, due to the lower returns on the rabbi trust investments.
 
General Corporate Expense
 
Lower general corporate expenses were attributed to decreased employee-related costs compared to last year.
OUTLOOK
 
"As a result of our strong performance during the quarter, we are raising our full year guidance range from $2.75 to $2.85 per share to $2.85 to $2.91 per share, on an adjusted
1
 basis. Both guidance ranges exclude the 10 cent per share impact of the one-time charges in our second quarter pertaining to the closing of the Valley Fresh plant and the reduced value of the deferred tax asset resulting from the new health care laws," concluded Ettinger.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
Effective August 15, 2010, the Company paid its 328
th
 consecutive quarterly dividend, at the annual rate of $0.84.
