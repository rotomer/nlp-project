COMMENTARY
 
"We are pleased to report a strong finish this year, with both earnings and sales up double-digits this quarter. Earnings growth was driven by segment profit gains in our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Foods segments," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.
 
"Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment led the way with robust earnings attributable to improved efficiencies across all areas of our business, aided by strong commodity turkey meat prices and lower grain costs. Our Refrigerated Foods segment also posted strong earnings, benefiting from higher pork operating margins. Our Grocery Products segment had a difficult quarter, hampered by higher raw material input costs in comparison to very low input costs a year ago," commented Ettinger.
 
"We hit the seven billion dollar mark in annual sales for the first time in our Company's history, fueled by sales growth across all five of our segments. We were particularly gratified that sales grew across all of our branded, value-added product portfolios," stated Ettinger.
 
"We continue to be pleased with the excellent progress made with our new product lines in both our MegaMex Foods business and our
Country Crock
side dish acquisition, both of which contributed to our positive results this quarter," remarked Ettinger.
 
"This morning, we announced an $.18 per share increase to our annual dividend rate (or 21.4%), making the new dividend $1.02 per share. This is the 45
th
 consecutive year in which we've increased our dividend," Ettinger concluded.
 
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  FOURTH QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (14% of Net Sales, 21% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Grocery Products segment profit declined 6 percent due primarily to higher raw material costs. Sales grew 24 percent driven primarily by increased sales of  chili and hash,  microwave meals, and strong sales growth across much of the MegaMex Foods product portfolio. The  family of products also showed solid sales growth in the quarter.
HORMEL
COMPLEATS
SPAM
 
Refrigerated Foods (53% of Net Sales, 42% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Refrigerated Foods delivered another strong quarter, with segment operating profit up 22 percent, aided by strong pork operating margins. Sales grew 26 percent, led by sales of
HORMEL
 party trays and pepperoni, and  deli meats  in the Meat Products group, and by sales of  ethnic meats,  deli meats and  barbecue meats in the Foodservice group.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (19% of Net Sales, 23% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Jennie-O Turkey Store had an excellent quarter, with segment operating profit up 90 percent, driven by efficiency gains throughout the entire supply chain and in its operations. Earnings were also aided by higher commodity turkey meat prices and an incremental gain of 7.3 million dollars, attributable to open grain positions in their hedging program that affected earnings during the quarter. Sales grew 19 percent, led by sales gains in each of the value-added businesses.
 
Specialty Foods (10% of Net Sales, 10% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Specialty Foods segment had a challenging quarter with segment profit down 6 percent, resulting from higher raw material costs in its Specialty Products business. These more than offset stronger results in the other two businesses led by sales of sugar, sugar substitutes and nutritional jars. Sales improved 12 percent, with gains across all three businesses.
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 4% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Segment profit for the All Other segment, which consists primarily of Hormel Foods International, declined 3 percent, hindered by higher input costs associated with export sales. Sales grew 33 percent, driven primarily by higher export sales of the
SPAM
 family of products.
 
Net Interest and Investment Income
Net interest and investment income was flat with a year ago.
 
General Corporate Expense
General corporate expenses were higher due to an increase in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve and higher pension and insurance expenses.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"We have solid top-line momentum heading into fiscal 2011. We also expect to generate segment profit growth in all five segments. Pork operating margins and turkey fundamentals remain strong. We also face some headwinds during fiscal 2011 including continued higher raw material costs, higher commodity grain costs and a more difficult comparison with a 53 week year and the hedging gain. Taking all of these factors and others into account, we are setting our fiscal 2011 guidance range at $3.10 to $3.20 per share," remarked Ettinger.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
Effective November 15, 2010, the Company paid its 329
th
 consecutive quarterly dividend. The annual rate for 2010 was $0.84.
