Item 3.03
Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders
 
On January 31, 2011, stockholders of Hormel Foods Corporation (the Company) approved a proposal to effect a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock.  Per the proposal, the Company's common stock will be reclassified by reducing the par value from $.0586 per share to $.0293 per share and increasing the number of authorized shares from 400,000,000 to 800,000,000 shares, in order to effect a two-for-one stock split.  The number of authorized shares of nonvoting common stock and preferred stock will also be increased to 400,000,000 shares and 160,000,000 shares, respectively, with no change in the par value of those shares.
 
The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation was amended effective February 1, 2011, to effect the split, as described above.  Per that amendment, each stockholder of record on January 31, 2011 will be entitled to receive one additional share of common stock, at a par value of $.0293, for each share of common stock already held on that date.  The Company will distribute the additional shares of $.0293 par value common stock in uncertificated (book-entry) form on or about February 14, 2011.  The Company will also reserve for issuance the maximum number of shares of common stock subject to options and other awards which have been granted or may be granted under the Company's stock award and other stock plans, which provide that the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance shall be appropriately adjusted in the event of a stock split.
