COMMENTARY
 
"We are pleased to report double-digit growth in both earnings and sales for the quarter. Earnings growth was led by our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments, both of which had a strong quarter. We are also gratified to attain sales growth in all five of our segments," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.
 
"Our Refrigerated Foods segment generated excellent results, benefitting from strong pork operating margins, and our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment delivered another outstanding quarter, aided by stronger commodity meat prices and improved efficiencies. Our international business in our All Other segment also achieved impressive results, driven by strong export sales. Both our Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments were pressured by higher commodity costs during the quarter," remarked Ettinger.
 
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  SECOND QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (13% of Net Sales, 21% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Grocery Products segment operating profit declined 9 percent from adjusted
1
 segment operating profit a year ago, due to higher input costs.  Net sales exceeded last year by 1 percent. Strong results from our core products, such as the family of products, bacon toppings hash and stew offset soft sales of our microwave products and imported canned meats. The MegaMex Foods business continued to grow sales.

Refrigerated Foods (53% of Net Sales, 38% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Refrigerated Foods segment exceeded last year's profitability by 27 percent, due primarily to higher pork operating margins.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (19% of Net Sales, 26% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Jennie-O Turkey Store had another excellent quarter, with segment operating profit up 45 percent from a year ago. Stronger commodity meat markets and improved efficiencies contributed to the good results. Net sales for the quarter rose 25 percent, and sales of our value-added products rose in all three trade channels.
 
Specialty Foods (10% of Net Sales, 10% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Specialty Foods segment operating profit declined 11 percent, due to higher raw material costs.  Net sales grew 4 percent, as higher sales of private label canned meats, sugar and blended items offset softer nutritional jar sales.

All Other (5% of Net Sales, 5% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The All Other segment, which consists primarily of Hormel Foods International, grew segment profit 104 percent, and grew net sales by 45 percent, driven mostly by stronger exports of fresh pork and the family of products.

General Corporate Expense
General corporate expenses were higher than last year due primarily to higher pension and insurance costs.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"Given our strong results in the second quarter, we are raising our full year guidance range to $1.67 to $1.73 per share from $1.62 to $1.68 per share. We anticipate seeing higher input costs during the remainder of the year, and our team will continue to drive efficiency gains and advance pricing to offset these higher costs. We believe our strong portfolio of brands and our balanced model will allow us to overcome those obstacles," concluded Ettinger.
