COMMENTARY
 
"We are pleased to report improved earnings per share and sales for the quarter, which were up 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively," said Jeffrey M.

in our All Other segment was also a strong contributor to our earnings results.
 
Our Grocery Products segment generated solid results, benefitting from strong sales of Mexican products by our MegaMex Foods joint venture, and of our family of products. I was pleased to see sales of our microwave mealsgrow nicely in the quarter. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment delivered another good quarter, aided by strong value-added sales and operational and supply chain efficiencies. Our international business in our All Other segment achieved impressive results, led by strong pork export sales. Lower pork operating margins hindered our Refrigerated Foods segment results and our Specialty Foods segment was pressured by higher than expected raw material costs during the quarter."
