COMMENTARY
 
"I am proud of the team for finishing an outstanding year with a fourth quarter that met our expectations. For the quarter, we are pleased to have generated segment profit increases in four out of five segments and an overall net sales increase. Our tonnage was down in comparison with the 14 week quarter last year, but we held our own on volumes in the face of significant pricing actions," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.
 
"In looking at the full year, we delivered significant sales growth of 9 percent, ending the year at a record $7.9 billion, with all five segments registering increases. We also grew earnings per share by an excellent 19 percent, finishing at record earnings of $1.74 per share. We enjoyed a particularly strong performance by the Jennie-O Turkey Store team, and both our All Other (International) and Refrigerated Foods segments also generated nice profit increases for the year. We enhanced our support of our key HORMEL and JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE brands in fiscal 2011 with effective advertising campaigns, and added to the portfolio of our fast-growing MegaMex Foods joint venture through the acquisition of the WHOLLY GUACAMOLE line and other related products," commented Ettinger.
 
"This morning we announced a $.09 per share increase to the annual dividend (or 17.6 percent), making the new dividend $.60 per share. This marks the 46th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend, and further evidences our intention to deliver superior total returns to our shareholders," stated Ettinger.
 
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  FOURTH QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (13% of Net Sales, 23% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Grocery Products segment profit increased 3 percent, due in part to improved results by the MegaMex Foods joint venture.  Sales overall for the quarter were down 2 percent.  The  family of products and  Bacon Toppings showed solid sales growth in the quarter.

Refrigerated Foods (52% of Net Sales, 36% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined 19 percent, as lower pork operating margins and higher commodity input costs negatively impacted results.  Net sales for the quarter were up 1 percent, led by

 convenience bacon and   hams in the Meat Products group and   deli meats and pizza toppings in the Foodservice group.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (20% of Net Sales, 25% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store had a solid quarter, with segment profit up 4 percent and sales up 2 percent.  The continued sales growth of value-added products and improved efficiencies throughout the supply chain and operations offset higher feed costs during the quarter.
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 11% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Specialty Foods segment posted operating profits 12 percent higher than last year on a 10 percent increase in sales.  Sales mix improvements on bulk and nutritional items and higher sales of private label canned meats contributed to the improved results.
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 5% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The All Other segment, which consists primarily of Hormel Foods International, posted segment profits that were 3 percent ahead of last year, and sales grew 12 percent. Results were primarily driven by stronger fresh pork exports.
 
General Corporate Expense
 
General corporate expenses were lower, driven principally by a reduction in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"We expect to deliver sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2012, even amidst some difficult comparisons and less-than-favorable macro conditions. In particular, we are looking for our Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and All Other (International) units to drive profit growth in fiscal 2012, as our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments maintain their position against historically high results. We also anticipate the comparisons to be more difficult in the first half of the year, becoming more favorable later in the year.  Taking all of the relevant factors into account, we are setting our 2012 guidance range at $1.79 to $1.89 per share," remarked Ettinger.

Effective November 15, 2011, the Company paid its 333
rd
 consecutive quarterly dividend, at the annual rate of $.51, marking the beginning of its 84

ADJUSTED EARNINGS
 
Adjusted net earnings for 2010 (a non-GAAP financial measurement) exclude one-time charges of $6.3 million ($0.02 per diluted share) relating to the closure of the Valley Fresh plant and an income tax charge of $7.1 million ($0.03 per diluted share) primarily due to the change in tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements by health care laws enacted in the prior year.
