COMMENTARY
 
"Our first quarter earnings of 48 cents per share was the second best in our Company's history, albeit down from a year ago," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.  "Sales grew six percent, with four of our five segments registering sales gains in the quarter."
 
"I was pleased with the strong results achieved by our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment, led by increased retail value-added sales. Our International business also delivered a solid quarter, fueled by strong export sales. Results of our Refrigerated Foods segment were hindered by significantly lower pork operating margins, and our Grocery Products segment results were adversely impacted by softer sales in the center of the store," commented Ettinger.
 
"We are encouraged by continued growth of our MegaMex Foods joint venture, led by increased sales of our DON MIGUEL products and our WHOLLY GUACAMOLE line. Our Foodservice group also achieved solid sales growth during the quarter," stated Ettinger.
SEGMENT OPERATING SUMMARIES  FIRST QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (13% of Net Sales, 22% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
The Grocery Products segment operating profit declined 9 percent, due primarily to lower volumes and higher raw material costs.  Sales fell 3 percent with overall softer results partially offset by sales growth of the MegaMex Foods joint venture.
 
Refrigerated Foods (53% of Net Sales, 26% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined 44 percent, due primarily to lower pork operating margins.  Sales grew 7 percent during the quarter, led by sales of
 pepperoni,   side dishes, and   deli meats in the Meat Products groupand by sales of  deli meats,  barbecue products, and  ethnic products in the Foodservice group.

Jennie-O Turkey Store (19% of Net Sales, 38% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Jennie-O Turkey Store had an outstanding quarter, with segment operating profit up 4 percent, over a very strong quarter a year ago.  Sales grew 4 percent led by sales of
JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE
 retail fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers.
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 8% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Segment operating profit for Specialty Foods declined 4 percent, due primarily to higher raw material and freight costs.  Sales grew 14 percent, led by sales of nutritional products, private label products, sugar, and liquid portions.
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 6% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
Segment operating profit for the All Other segment, which consists primarily of Hormel Foods International, increased 25 percent for the quarter, while sales grew 17 percent, led primarily by stronger exports of fresh pork and sales of the
SPAM
family of products.
 
Net Interest and Investment Income/Expense
Net interest and investment expense was lower, as a result of improved investment returns and lower interest expense.
 
General Corporate Expense
General corporate expenses were lower than last year due to higher expenses last year associated with the vesting of options under the Universal Stock Option award granted to all employees in 2007.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"As we stated in our fourth quarter release, we anticipated a challenging operating environment this year, and for comparisons to be more difficult in the first half of the year and to become more favorable in the back half.  We continue to look for slowly improving results from our Refrigerated Foods segment as pork operating margins return to more normalized levels.  Sales in our Grocery Products segment and Meat Products group should also improve, as we begin to see the effects of our new advertising campaigns supporting our HORMEL and SPAM brands. Taking all of the relevant factors into account, we are maintaining our full-year earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share," concluded Ettinger.
DIVIDENDS
 
Effective February 15, 2012, the Company paid its 334
th
 consecutive quarterly dividend, at the annual rate of $.60.
