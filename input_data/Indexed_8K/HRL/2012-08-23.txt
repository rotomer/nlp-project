segment delivered another good quarter, aided by increased value-added sales and an improved product mix. Our international business continues to achieve impressive results, led by strong export sales of our family of products and fresh pork. Increased value-added sales offset lower pork operating margins, boosting our Refrigerated Foods segment results during the quarter. Our Specialty Foods team generated excellent results on higher sales during the quarter," Ettinger remarked.

Net Interest and Investment Expense
Net interest and investment expense was lower due principally to reduced debt levels and a lower interest rate.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"Our excellent results in the third quarter give us momentum heading into the fourth quarter and put us on track to achieve results consistent with our annual guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share." concluded Ettinger. "Increased grain costs will present a challenge, but the strength of our balanced business model and the vibrancy of our branded, value-added portfolio should support continued sales and earnings growth as we close out fiscal 2012."
