COMMENTARY
 
"We achieved solid results in the quarter with earnings per share and sales up 14 percent and 3 percent, respectively. We are pleased to have generated both segment profit and sales increases in four out of five segments. We continue to enjoy sales and volume growth in many of our value-added franchises, demonstrating that our growth strategies are working," said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.
 
"In looking at the full year, we finished in the upper half of our guidance range. We delivered sales growth of 4 percent, ending the year at a record $8.2 billion, with all five segments registering increases. We also grew earnings per share by 7 percent, finishing at record earnings of $1.86 per share. We enjoyed another strong performance by our Jennie-O Turkey Store and International teams. Our Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments also generated nice profit increases for the year. We enhanced our support of our key HORMEL and JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE brands in fiscal 2012 with effective advertising campaigns, and ran a new advertising campaign celebrating the 75
th
 anniversary of our iconic SPAM brand. Finally, we met our goal of $2 billion in sales of new products by 2012," commented Ettinger.
 
"This morning we announced an $.08 per share increase to the annual dividend (or 13 percent), making the new dividend $.68 per share. This marks the 47th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend, and provides further evidence of our intention to deliver superior total returns to our shareholders," stated Ettinger.
 
SEGMENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS  FOURTH QUARTER
 
Grocery Products (16% of Net Sales, 26% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Grocery Products segment profit increased 22 percent, led by strong sales of the  family of products and the portfolio of products within our MegaMex Foods joint venture.  Sales for the quarter were up 21 percent, with contributions by the aforementioned products and  chili.
SPAM
HORMEL
 
Refrigerated Foods (49% of Net Sales, 30% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined 12 percent, as strong results in our value-added businesses were not able to fully offset lower pork operating margins and losses in our live hog operations.  Sales for the quarter were down 3 percent, due to lower commodity meat prices. Value-added products grew in the quarter, led by
HORMEL
 pepperoni and party trays in the Meat Products group and   deli meats in the Foodservice group.
HORMEL
NATURAL CHOICE
Jennie-O Turkey Store (20% of Net Sales, 26% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
Jennie-O Turkey Store had another solid quarter, with segment profit up 5 percent.  The continued sales growth of value-added products and an improved product mix offset higher feed costs during the quarter. Sales for the quarter increased 5 percent, led by sales of
JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE
 fresh tray pack, turkey bacon and turkey burgers.
 
Specialty Foods (11% of Net Sales, 12% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The Specialty Foods segment posted operating profits 8 percent higher than last year on a 7 percent increase in sales.  Higher sales of private label canned meats contributed to the improved results.
 
All Other (4% of Net Sales, 6% of Total Segment Operating Profit)
 
The All Other segment, which consists primarily of Hormel Foods International, posted segment profits that were 24 percent ahead of last year, while sales grew 1 percent. Strong export sales to Canada and improved margins in the
SPAM
 family of products contributed to the results.
 
General Corporate Expense
 
General corporate expenses were lower, driven principally by a reduction in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve and lower employee related costs.
 
OUTLOOK
 
"We expect to deliver sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2013. In particular, we are looking for our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and All Other (International) segments to drive profit growth in fiscal 2013, as our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment goes up against higher grain costs and historically high results. We plan on making additional cuts to both our turkey and pork harvest levels during fiscal 2013, to reduce our exposure to volatile commodity markets. Taking all of the relevant factors into account, we are setting our 2013 guidance range at $1.90 to $2.00 per share," remarked Ettinger.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
Effective November 15, 2012, the Company paid its 337th consecutive quarterly dividend, at the annual rate of $.60.
