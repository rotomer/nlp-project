EXHIBIT 99.1 Texas Jury Awards Harris Corporation $61 Million ------------------------------------------------ In Patent Infringement Case --------------------------- MELBOURNE, FLORIDA, OCTOBER 30, 2002 - Harris Corporation (NYSE: HRS) announced that on October 29, 2002, in the United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of Harris Corporation in a patent infringement case against Ericsson, Inc. The jury found that Ericsson's cellular phones and cellular base stations infringe Harris' United States Patent No. 4,365,338 for digital transmissions over a dynamic dispersion channel. The jury awarded Harris approximately $61 million in compensatory damages and found that Ericsson's conduct was "willful." Based on the jury's finding that Ericsson's conduct was willful, the District Court could double or treble the jury award. It is likely that Ericsson will file post-trial motions and appeal the verdict. In the trial, Harris was represented by Henry Bunsow of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White of San Francisco; Brett Govett of Fullbright & Jaworski of Dallas; and Denise Demory of Demory & Grigg of San Francisco.
