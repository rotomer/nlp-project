Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On February 25, 2005, the Board of Directors of Harris Corporation ("") adopted an amendment to Harris' By-Laws adding a new Article IX which, among other things, permits Harris to issue shares of stock in either certificated or uncertificated form; however, if Harris issues shares of stock in uncertificated form, Harris is required to provide a physical share certificate to any holder of uncertificated shares who so requests. In addition, the amendment makes formal provision for certain other matters relating to Harris' stock, including contents of share certificates; signatures on share certificates; transfer agents and registrars; lost, stolen or destroyed share certificates and issuance of new certificates; transfers of shares of stock; and registered shareholders. The amendment was adopted in preparation for Harris becoming part of Depository Trust Company's Direct Registration System for publicly traded securities for the registration of Harris common stock and became effective immediately upon adoption. The foregoing summary of the amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Harris' By-Laws, as amended and restated, filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated in this Item 5.03 by reference.
Harris
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On February 25, 2005, Harris issued a press release announcing that the Board of Directors of Harris has declared a two-for-one stock split to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend consisting of authorized but unissued shares of Harris common stock, par value $1.00 per share. The stock dividend will be distributed on March 30, 2005 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 14, 2005, on the basis of one share of Harris common stock distributable for every one share of Harris common stock issued and outstanding. Further, Harris has adjusted the number of shares of common stock reserved under its various equity based agreements and compensation plans and the stock split also will result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio of Harris' 3.5% Convertible Debentures due 2022. The full text of Harris' press release announcing such action is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 8.01 by reference.

A written or printed notice of every annual or special meeting of the shareholders stating the time and place and the purposes thereof shall be given to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat and to each shareholder entitled to notice as provided by law, which notice shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to each shareholder at such shareholder's address as it appears on the records of the Company. It shall be the duty of the Secretary to give written notice of the annual meeting, and of each special meeting when requested so to do by the officer or directors calling such meeting.

     .   A complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at each meeting of shareholders, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of each and the number of voting shares held by each, shall be prepared by or at the instance of the Secretary and made available at the location where the meeting is to be held, at least ten (10) days before every meeting, and shall at all times during the usual hours for business in said ten (10) day period and during the time of said meeting be open to examination by any shareholder.

     .   Except as may otherwise be required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at a shareholders' meeting shall constitute a quorum to hold such meeting; provided, however, that any meeting, whether or not a quorum is present or otherwise, may, by vote of the holders of a majority of the voting shares represented thereat, adjourn from time to time and from place to place in the county wherein said meeting was originally called without notice other than by announcement at such meeting.
Section 7.   Quorum and Adjournments
     .   (a) The matters to be considered and brought before any annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Company shall be limited to only such matters, including the nomination and election of directors, as shall be brought properly before such meeting in compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8.
Section 8.   Advance Notice of Shareholder Nominees for Director and Other Shareholder Proposals
     (b) For any matter to be properly brought before any annual meeting of shareholders, the matter must be (i) specified in the notice of annual meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) brought before the annual meeting in the manner specified in this Section 8(b) by a shareholder of record entitled to vote at the annual meeting of
 
shareholders on such matter. In addition to any other requirements under applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws, persons nominated by shareholders for election as directors of the Company and any other proposals by shareholders shall be properly brought before the meeting only if notice of any such matter to be presented by a shareholder at such meeting of shareholders (the "Shareholder Notice") shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company not less than ninety (90) nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year; provided, however, if and only if the annual meeting is not scheduled to be held within a period that commences thirty (30) days before such anniversary date and ends thirty (30) days after such anniversary date (an annual meeting date outside such period being referred to herein as an "Other Meeting Date"), such Shareholder Notice shall be given in the manner provided herein by the later of the close of business on (i) the date ninety (90) days prior to such Other Meeting Date or (ii) the tenth day following the date such Other Annual Meeting Date is first publicly announced or disclosed. Any shareholder desiring to nominate any person or persons (as the case may be) for election as a director or directors of the Company shall deliver, as part of such Shareholder Notice, a statement in writing setting forth (i) the name of the person or persons to be nominated; (ii) the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the Company owned of record and beneficially by each such person, as reported to such shareholder by such nominee(s); (iii) the information regarding each such person required by paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (or the corresponding provisions of any regulation subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to the Company); (iv) each such person's signed consent to serve as a director of the Company if elected; and (v) such shareholder's name and address and the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the Company owned of record and beneficially by such shareholder. Any shareholder who gives a Shareholder Notice of any matter proposed to be brought before the meeting (other than a nomination of directors) shall deliver, as part of such Shareholder Notice, the text of the proposal to be presented and a brief written statement of the reasons why such shareholder favors the proposal and setting forth such shareholder's name and address, the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the Company owned of record and beneficially by such shareholder and, if applicable, any material interest of such shareholder in the matter proposed (other than as a shareholder). As used herein, shares "beneficially owned" shall mean all shares which such person is deemed to beneficially own pursuant to Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). If a shareholder is entitled to vote only for a specific class or category of directors at a meeting (annual or special), such shareholder's right to nominate one or more individuals for election as a director at the meeting shall be limited to such class or category of directors.
     Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8(b) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company at the next annual meeting is increased and either all of the nominees for director at the next annual meeting or the size of the increased Board of Directors is not publicly announced or disclosed by the Company at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a Shareholder Notice shall also be considered timely hereunder, but only
 
with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the first date all of such nominees or the size of the increased Board of Directors shall have been publicly announced or disclosed.
     (c) Except as provided in the immediately following sentence, only such matters shall be properly brought before a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of such meeting. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any shareholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the Shareholder Notice required by Section 8(b) hereof shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which the date of the special meeting and either the names of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting or the number of directors to be elected is publicly announced or disclosed.
     (d) For purposes of this Section 8, a matter shall be deemed to have been "publicly announced or disclosed" if such matter is disclosed in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news or wire service or in a document publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     (e) In no event shall the adjournment of an annual meeting or special meeting or the postponement of any meeting that does not require a change in the record date for such meeting, or any announcement thereof, commence a new period for the giving of notice as provided in this Section 8. This Section 8 shall not (i) affect the rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) apply to the election of directors selected by or pursuant to the provisions of Article FOURTH, Section 3 of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances.
     (f) The person presiding at any meeting of shareholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall have the power and duty to determine whether notice of nominees and other matters proposed to be brought before a meeting has been duly given in the manner provided in this Section 8 and, if not so given, shall direct and declare at the meeting that such nominees and other matters are out of order and shall not be considered.
     .   The Board of Directors of the Company may adopt by resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of meetings of shareholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with applicable law and such rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of each meeting of shareholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations

Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such person in defending any such action, suit or proceeding shall be paid or reimbursed by the Company promptly upon demand by such person and, if any such demand is made in advance of the final disposition of any such action, suit or proceeding, promptly upon receipt by the Company of an undertaking of such person to repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. The rights provided to any person by this by-law shall be enforceable against the Company by such person, who shall be presumed to have relied upon it in serving or continuing to serve as a director or officer or in such other capacity as provided above. In addition, the rights provided to any person by this by-law shall survive the termination of such person as any such director, officer, trustee, member, stockholder, partner, incorporator or liquidator and, insofar as such person served at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, member, stockholder, partner, incorporator or liquidator of or in any other capacity for any other enterprise, shall survive the termination of such request as to service prior to termination of such request. No amendment of this by-law shall impair the rights of any person arising at any time with respect to events occurring prior to such amendment.

     For purposes of this by-law, the term "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the economic or voting ownership interest; the term "other enterprise" shall include any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, association or other unincorporated organization or other entity and any employee benefit plan; the term "officer," when used with respect to the Company, shall refer to any officer elected by or appointed pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Article V of these By-Laws, when used with respect to a Subsidiary or other enterprise that is a corporation, shall refer to any person elected or appointed pursuant to the by-laws of such Subsidiary or other enterprise or chosen in such manner as is prescribed by the by-laws of such Subsidiary or other enterprise or determined by the Board of Directors of such Subsidiary or other enterprise, and when used with respect to a Subsidiary or other enterprise that is not a corporation or is organized in a foreign jurisdiction, the term "officer" shall include in addition to any officer of such entity, any person serving in a similar capacity or as the manager of such entity; service "at the request of the Company" shall include service as a director or officer of the Company which imposes
 
duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries shall be deemed to be indemnifiable expenses; and action by a person with respect to an employee benefit plan which such person reasonably believes to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of such plan shall be deemed to be action not opposed to the best interests of the Company.
     To the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, the Company may provide to (i) any one or more employees and other agents of the Company, (ii) any one or more officers, employees and other agents of any Subsidiary and (iii) any one or more directors, officers, employees and other agents of any other enterprise, rights of indemnification and to receive payment or reimbursement of expenses, including attorneys' fees, that are similar to the rights conferred in this Article VI on directors and officers of the Company or any Subsidiary or other enterprise. Any such rights shall have the same force and effect as they would have if they were conferred in this Article VI.
     Nothing in this Article VI shall limit the power of the Company or the Board of Directors to provide rights of indemnification and to make payment and reimbursement of expenses, including attorneys' fees, to directors, officers, employees, agents and other persons otherwise than pursuant to this Article VI.
     The corporate seal, circular in form, shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Company and the words "Corporate SealDelaware."
     The Board of Directors may close the stock transfer books of the Company for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date of any meeting of the shareholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares shall go into effect; provided, however, that in lieu of closing the stock transfer books as aforesaid, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date, not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares shall go into effect, as a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any such dividend, or to any such allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange of shares, and in such case such shareholders, and only such shareholders as shall be shareholders of record on the date so fixed, shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend or to receive such allotment of rights or to exercise such rights as the case may
 
be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Company after any such record date fixed as aforesaid.
     .   The shares of stock of the Company shall be represented by certificates in such form as the appropriate officers of the Company may from time to time prescribe; provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of stock of the Company shall be uncertificated shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the adoption of such a resolution or resolutions by the Board of Directors, each holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled, upon request, to a certificate representing such shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to any share represented by a certificate theretofore issued until such certificate is surrendered to the Company. Share certificates shall be numbered and registered in a share register as they are issued. Share certificates shall exhibit the name of the registered holder and the number and class of shares and the series, if any, represented thereby and the par value of each such share or a statement that each such share is without par value, as the case may be. Except as otherwise provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the holders of shares represented by certificates of the same class and series shall be identical.
Section 1.   Certificates; Uncertificated Shares
     .   Every share certificate shall be signed, in the name of the Company, by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President and countersigned, in the name of the Company, by the Corporate Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer and shall be sealed with the Company's corporate seal. Such signatures and seal may be facsimile, engraved or printed. The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks and one or more registrars and may require any or all certificates representing shares of stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.
