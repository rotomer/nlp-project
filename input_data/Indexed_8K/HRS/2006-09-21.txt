Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 15, 2006, Harris Corporation ("Harris") was advised in writing by the Internal Revenue Service that the United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation had approved a settlement between Harris and the Internal Revenue Service concerning the tax audit for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. As a result of this settlement and related matters, Harris will record a reduction to tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 of $12 million, or $.08 per diluted share. The favorable impact of this settlement is expected to lower our full fiscal year 2007 tax rate from the previously provided guidance of 34% to 33%.
