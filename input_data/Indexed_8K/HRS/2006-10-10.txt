Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
Harris Corporation ("Harris") currently has a 19.6% ownership interest in Terion, Inc. ("Terion"), a privately-held company that provides wireless data communication and information solutions for mobile and remote business-to-business applications focusing on the transportation industry. Harris has invested both technology and cash in Terion, and Harris initial investment in Terion was made during fiscal year 1994. Harris carrying value for its investment in Terion is currently $23.0 million. None of Terions revenue is generated from Harris or its affiliates. As Harris previously reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 ("2006 Form 10K"), Terions largest customer, which represents approximately 60,000 units of an installed base of approximately 110,000 units, informed Terion in July 2006 that it had signed a contract with another provider and would be moving its fleet off of Terions system over the next two years. < br> Terion and the customer are still actively negotiating the terms of the wind down of their relationship, which will likely include an ongoing support agreement between Terion and the customer. Further, Terion is also exploring strategic alternatives for the company. Terion management has provided Harris with a revised forecast for the business and an update on the strategic alternatives for the company. Harris provided this information to an independent valuation specialist to assist in determining the fair value of the investment. Based on the information provided and the analysis performed by the independent valuation specialist using different probabilities for likely outcomes, authorized officers of Harris concluded on October 10, 2006, that Harris will record a $19.8 million charge for the impairment of the investment ($12.9 million after-tax or $.09 per diluted share). This will be included as "Non-operating income (loss)" on our fiscal year 2007 first quarters Condensed Consolidate d Statement of Income. These impairment charges are not expected to result in any future cash expenditures.
