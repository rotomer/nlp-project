Item 8.01 Other Events.
On May 14, 2007, Howard L. Lance, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Harris Corporation ("Harris"), established a written pre-arranged plan to sell shares of Harris stock. The plan was established as part of Mr. Lances long-term strategy for asset diversification and financial, estate and tax planning activities. Mr. Lances plan was established in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Harris insider trading policy. The plan provides for the sale of shares of Harris stock to be awarded (maximum of 60,000 shares) pursuant to the terms of the Performance Share Award granted to Mr. Lance on August 27, 2004 covering the three-year performance period started July 3, 2004 and ending June 29, 2007, after sufficient shares are withheld for tax withholding. Such shares will be sold on a predetermined date in September 2007, subject to early termination or suspension upon the occurrence of c ertain specified events. Mr. Lances ownership interest in Harris is considerably in excess of Harris' stock ownership guidelines, even taking into account the sale of shares pursuant to the plan. The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals to establish pre-arranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material non-public information, and allows such pre-arranged trades to be made pursuant to the plan regardless of any subsequent material non-public information that an individual may receive. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over time.
