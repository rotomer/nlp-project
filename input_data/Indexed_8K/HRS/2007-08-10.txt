Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 10, 2007, Gary L. McArthur, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Harris Corporation ("Harris") established a pre-arranged plan to exercise options to purchase shares of Harris common stock and to subsequently sell the shares acquired upon such exercises. The plan provides for the sale of up to 24,000 shares of Harris stock acquired upon the exercise of stock options beginning in November 2007 and ending in June 2008, subject to specified limitations and minimum price thresholds. The plan was established as part of Mr. McArthurs long-term strategy for asset diversification and financial, estate and tax planning activities. Mr. McArthurs plan was established in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Harris insider trading policy. On August 10, Mr. McArthur also exercised options to purchase 20,000 shares of Harris common stock and sold such shares. Mr. McArthurs ownership i nterest in Harris is and will remain in excess of the Harris stock ownership guidelines. The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals to establish pre-arranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material non-public information, and allows such pre arranged trades to be made pursuant to the plan regardless of any subsequent material non-public information that an individual may receive. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversity their investment portfolios over time.
