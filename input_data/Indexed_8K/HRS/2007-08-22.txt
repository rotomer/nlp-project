Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants
Board of Directors Multimax Incorporated
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Multimax Incorporated (the Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of Netco Government Services LLC (formerly known as Netco Government Services, Inc.) (the Parent) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards generally accepted in the United States of America as established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Multimax Incorporated as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTE ADESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Multimax Incorporated (the Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of Netco Government Services LLC (f/k/a Netco Government Services, Inc.) (the Parent), is an enterprise integration solutions provider offering network, information technology products, architecture, design, engineering, implementation and management services for enterprise information technology systems primarily to the U.S. federal government market. The Company's services enable government agencies to transform their enterprise information and technology systems into less-complex, easily managed and secure networks.
The Company is a provider of network management services to the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) project as a tier one subcontractor to Electronic Data Systems (EDS), among other Contracts. A majority of the Company's revenue is related to the NMCI project (see Note I). The objective of the NMCI project is to provide the Navy and the Marine Corps with comprehensive, end-to-end information services through a new common computing and communications environment. The Company is responsible for voice, video and data network services from the telecommunications demarcation at each base to the wall port at each seat.
NOTE BSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Acquisition and Combination
In accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," we account for all business combinations by the purchase method. Furthermore, we recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or legal rights or if they are separable from goodwill.
As discussed in note J, on May 31, 2006, the Parent acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Multimax, Inc. for cash. Multimax is a Maryland-based systems integrator that provides information technology products primarily within the federal government market. The Company assembles computer products, provides system integration, and research and development services to various agencies within the Department of Defense. The acquisition was made to broaden the federal customer base and to acquire additional federal contracting vehicles to which the company's integration services could be marketed. The goodwill amounts recognized in the acquisition results from the assembled workforce, including a management team with a proven track record of winning both service and product contract vehicles within the Department of Defense and other agencies with the federal government.
Effective July 1, 2006, all of the assets of the Parent were contributed to Multimax. These financial statements reflect the historical operations of the parent company and the operations of Multimax from the date of acquisition. The operations of Multimax prior to the acquisition are excluded from these financial statements. The total cost of the acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, and other intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition totaled $47,874.

NOTE BSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Continued
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash is held at two financial institutions, and at times, such balances may be in excess of federally insured limits.
Short-term Investments
The Company evaluates the classification of investments in marketable securities as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and periodically re-evaluates such classification. Investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Realized gains and losses are included in interest income. Unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income  if any. The cost of securities is based on the specific identification method.
Accounts Receivable
The Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business, but the Company generally does not require collateral or any other security from customers. Because the Company's primary customers are agencies or other instrumentalities of federal, state or local governments, the risk of uncollectible accounts is low. Management performs credit evaluations of non-governmental customers based on financial information and current ability to pay. When such credit evaluations reveal substantial credit risk regarding a particular customer, management will establish appropriate reserves on each of that customer's billed and unbilled amounts, with a general reserve for smaller aged accounts.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes, over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years or the life of the lease.
Long-lived Assets
The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed periodically or when factors indicating impairment are present. Projected discounted cash flows are used when reviewing these assets. When the estimated discounted cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company determines if impairment exists. The amount of impairment loss recorded will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," the company classifies intangible assets into two categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization and (2) goodwill. The company tests intangible assets with definite lives for impairment if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. The
 
Multimax Incorporated
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts are in thousands unless otherwise disclosed)  
 
 
NOTE BSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Continued
company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of the definite lived intangible asset is not recoverable by the cash flow generated from the use of the asset.
Goodwill is not amortized. The company performs our impairment test of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The impairment tests include comparing the fair value of the company with the carrying value. The company uses a number of methodologies in conducting our impairment tests, including discounted cash flow analyses. When the fair value is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to the fair value.
The company determines the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors that are considered when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement, the history of the asset, the company's long term strategy for the use of the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Refer to Note J.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the Company's long-term contract with EDS is accounted for under the percentage-of-completion, units of delivery method. Revenues under this contract are recognized as individual work stations, and other services are resident on the network managed by the Company. Profits expected to be realized on contracts are based on the Company's estimates of total contract revenue value and costs at completion. Contract costs in excess of revenues earned are included in the balance sheet as accrued costs on uncompleted contracts. Costs in excess of revenue earned is included in the balance sheet as revenue accumulated in excess of costs earned on uncompleted contracts.
Revenue from time-and-materials contracts is recognized in the period the services are provided and is based on contractually defined billing rates applied to services performed and materials delivered. Revenue from cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts is recognized on the basis of reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period, increased by the applicable fringe benefit, overhead and general and administrative costs to include a percentage of a fixed fee. The Company considers fixed fees under cost-plus-fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs actually incurred in performance of the contract for level of effort contracts. Contract costs include direct labor combined with an allocation of operational overhead and other direct costs. Revenue from firm-fixed-price contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method for performance based contracts and equitably over the year for fixed priced maintenance contracts. Under this method, individual contract revenue earned is increased by the percentage relationship that contract costs incurred bear to the management's estimate of the costs to complete the effort.
Amounts for contract changes are included in revenues only when realized. Assumptions used for recording revenues are adjusted in the period of change to reflect revisions in contract value and estimated costs. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. The Company recorded changes in estimate of $6,207 and $2,692 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments
Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of current financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair values. The carrying value of long- term financial liabilities approximate their fair values based on rates that the Company would incur on similar debt.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. federal and state taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. Prior to the reorganization, the company's taxable income was included on the consolidated federal income tax return filed by its parent. Subsequent to the reorganization, the company will not benefit from any remaining net operating carryforwards of the parent. See Note F.
Use of Estimates
Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassification
Certain 2005 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 presentation.

Unbilled accounts receivable are composed primarily of unbilled costs from billing customers on the basis of contractual terms. Unbilled accounts receivable have been classified as current assets in accordance with industry practice. Management believes that substantially all unbilled receivables at December 31, 2006, will be billed in 2007.

NOTE J ACQUISTIONS AND INVESTMENTS
On May 31, 2006, the Parent acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Multimax, Inc., a Maryland based systems integrator that provides information technology products and services primarily within the Federal government market. The total net cash payments through December 31, 2006 amounted to $51,778. A contingency payment of $2,000 was made to the sellers in February 2007. This contingency payment was made for a government contract that was awarded to the seller subsequent to the transaction closing date of May 31, 2006. In addition to the amounts paid through December 31, 2006 and the $2,000 payment in January 2007, the Company may be required to pay up to, and not to exceed, $1,500 for tax benefits that will have a positive impact on the Company's 2006 tax return.

EXHIBIT 99.3
     Presented below is Harris Corporation's ("Harris", references to "we", "our" or "us" being references to Harris) historical and pro forma condensed combined financial information as of and for the three quarters ended March 30, 2007 and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to our acquisition of Multimax Incorporated ("Multimax") on June 15, 2007 for $402 million which was financed with $400 million in short term commercial paper issued in June 2007.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on the estimates and assumptions included in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the purchase method of accounting in which the total cost of the Multimax acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the effective date of the acquisition. The adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information represent the preliminary determination of such adjustments based upon currently available information. We have obtained a third-party valuation of the acquired identifiable intangible assets. In addition, we are in the process of strategically assessing our combined business which may give rise to additional purchase liabilities. Accordingly, the actual adjustments to be recorded in connection with the final purchase price allocation may differ from the pro forma adjustments reflected within the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated information. Such revisions to the preliminary purchase price allocation could have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation within one year from the date of the Multimax acquisition.
     We combined our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the three quarters ended March 30, 2007 with Multimax's unaudited statement of income for the nine months ended March 31, 2007 and our audited consolidated statement of income for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2006 with Multimax's unaudited statement of income for twelve months ending June 30, 2006. We combined our March 30, 2007 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet with Multimax's unaudited balance sheet as of March 31, 2007 and our June 30, 2006 audited consolidated balance sheet with Multimax's unaudited balance sheet as of June 30, 2006.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that might have been achieved had the transaction occurred as of an earlier date, and they are not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position. These pro forma amounts do not, therefore, project our financial position or results of operations for any future date or period. You should read the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three quarters ended March 30, 2007.
