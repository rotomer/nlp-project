Performance Period
(b) . Provided the Award has not previously been forfeited, as soon as administratively practicable following the expiration of the Performance Period and the satisfaction of the applicable tax withholding obligations, the Corporation shall at its option, cause the Performance Shares as to which the Employee is entitled pursuant hereto: (i) to be released without restriction on transfer by delivery to the custody of the Employee of a stock certificate registered in the name of the Employee or his or her designee or (ii) to be credited without restriction on transfer to a book-entry account for the benefit of the Employee or his or her designee maintained by the Corporation's stock transfer agent or its designee.
Release of Award
(c) .
Satisfaction of Performance Objectives
(i) The Performance Shares are granted to the Employee subject to the prohibitions on transfer set forth in Section 4 below, which shall lapse, if at all, based upon attainment during the Performance Period of the performance objectives set forth in the Statement of Performance Goals delivered to the Employee at the time of the Award (the "").
Statement of Performance Goals
(ii) The number of Performance Shares actually earned shall be contingent upon the attainment during the Performance Period of the performance objectives set forth in the Statement of Performance Goals. The number of Performance Shares actually earned shall be determined upon the expiration of the Performance Period in accordance with the Statement of Performance Goals. The final determination of the number of Performance Shares actually earned and to be released without restriction on transfer will be authorized by the Harris Board of Directors, the Board Committee, or its designee. Performance Shares will be forfeited (A) if they are not earned at the end of the Performance Period or (B) except as otherwise provided herein, if the Employee ceases to be employed by the Corporation at any time prior to the expiration of the Performance Period.
(iii) If employment is commenced after the first day of the first fiscal year of the Performance Period (such commencement date is referred to as the ""), the Employee shall be eligible to receive a pro-rata portion of the Performance Shares which would have been issued to the Employee under the Award at the end of the Performance Period determined in accordance with the prior provisions of this Section 1(c), and the remaining Performance Shares subject to the Award shall be automatically forfeited. Such forfeited portion shall be measured by a fraction, of which the numerator is the number of days between the first day of the first fiscal year of the Performance Period and the Start Date, and the denominator is the number of days of the Performance Period. Other than with respect to the final payout, the pro-ration pursuant to this Section will not otherwise impact the Award (e.g., the Employee will have full voting rights and will be entitled to receive dividend equivalent payments and other distributions with respect to all Award shares).
Start Date
(d) . During the Performance Period, the Employee may exercise full voting rights with respect to all Performance Shares subject to the Award and shall be entitled to receive cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the Performance Shares. If any such dividend or distribution is paid in securities of the Corporation (including additional shares of Common Stock), such securities shall be subject to the same restrictions and conditions as the Performance Shares in respect of which such dividend or distribution was made. If the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is changed as a result of a stock dividend, stock split or the like, without additional consideration to the Corporation, the Performance Shares subject to this Award shall be adjusted to correspond to the change in the Corporation's outstanding shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, upon the expiration of the Performance Period, the Employee may exercise voting rights and shall be entitled to receive dividends and other distributions with respect to the number of shares to which the Employee is entitled pursuant hereto.
Rights During Performance Period
(e) . The number of Performance Shares subject to the Award is based upon the assumption that the Employee shall continue to perform substantially the same duties throughout the Performance Period, and such number of Performance Shares may be reduced or increased by the Board of Directors or the Board Committee or its designee without formal amendment of the Agreement to reflect a change in duties during the Performance Period.
Adjustments to Award
2. . Except in the event of a Change of Control covered in Section 5 herein or as otherwise provided in the Award Letter, if the Employee ceases to be an employee of the Corporation prior to the expiration of the Performance Period:
Forfeiture; Termination of Employment

(b) due to (i) death, (ii) permanent disability, (iii) retirement after age 55 with ten or more years of full-time service, or (iv) involuntary termination of employment by the Corporation other than for Misconduct, the Employee shall be eligible to receive a pro-rata portion of the Performance Shares which would have been issued to the Employee under the Award at the end of the Performance Period determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 1(c) hereof, and the remaining Performance Shares subject to the Award shall be automatically forfeited. Such pro-rata portion shall be measured by a fraction, of which the numerator is the number of days of the Performance Period during which the Employee's employment continued, and the denominator is the number of days of the Performance Period. Termination of employment of the Employee by the Corporation for deliberate, willful or gross misconduct, as determined by the Corporation, shall constitute "."
Misconduct
3. . If the Employee transfers employment from one business unit of the Corporation or an Affiliate to another business unit or Affiliate during a Performance Period, the Employee shall be eligible to receive the number of Performance Shares determined by the Board of Directors or the Board Committee or its designee based upon such factors as the Board of Directors or the Board Committee or its designee, as the case may be, in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.
Transfer of Employment
4. . Until the expiration of the Performance Period and payout of the Award pursuant to Section 1(b), the Award and the Performance Shares subject to the Award and the rights granted under these Terms and Conditions and the Agreement are not transferable except to family members or trusts by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, provided that the Award and the Performance Shares subject to the Award may not be so transferred to family members or trusts except as permitted by applicable law or regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as aforesaid, until the expiration of the Performance Period and payout of the Award pursuant to Section 1(b), the Award and such shares may not be sold, exchanged, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered or otherwise disposed of, shall not be assignable by operation of law, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, charge, alienation or similar process. Any attempt to effect any of the foregoing shall be null and void and without effect.
Prohibition Against Transfer
5. . (a) Upon a Change of Control of the Corporation as defined in Section 11.1 of the Plan, the performance objectives shall be conclusively deemed to have been attained immediately upon the occurrence of such Change of Control. The Performance Shares subject to the Award shall be released without restriction on transfer to the Employee at the end of the Performance Period; , , that, following such Change of Control but prior to the end of the Performance Period: (i) in the event of the Employee's death, termination due to permanent disability, retirement after age 55 with ten or more years of full-time service, or involuntary termination other than for Cause, the Performance Shares subject to the Award shall be vested immediately and released without restriction on transfer as soon as administratively practicable; (ii) in the event of the Employee's resignation or termination for Cause, the Performance Shares subject to the Award shall be forfeited; and (iii) in the event of a "change in the Corporation's capital structure," the Performance Shares subject to the Award shall be vested immediately and, at the election of the Employee, released without restriction on transfer or shall be converted and paid in cash. The amount of the cash payment made under this Section 5 will be an amount equal to the number of Performance Shares subject to the Award multiplied by the highest price per share paid in any transaction reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index: (A) during the sixty (60) day period preceding and including the date of a "change in the Corporation's capital structure;" or (B) during the sixty (60) day period preceding and including the date of the Change of Control.

The payout of the Award shall be determined upon the expiration of the Performance Period in accordance with the Statement of Performance Goals. The final determination of the payout of the Award will be authorized by the Harris Board of Directors, the Board Committee, or its designee.

Such forfeited portion shall be measured by a fraction, of which the numerator is the number of days between the first day of the first fiscal year of the Performance Period and the Start Date, and the denominator is the number of days of the Performance Period. Other than with respect to the final payout, the pro-ration pursuant to this Section will not otherwise impact the Award.
Start Date
(d) . During the Performance Period, the Employee shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Units. During the Performance Period, if any dividends or other distributions are paid in cash to holders of Common Stock, the Employee shall be entitled to receive dividend equivalents, in cash, paid with respect to the number of Shares underlying the Performance Units. Such dividend equivalents will be paid to the Employee as soon as is practicable following payment of the dividend or other distribution to holders of Common Stock, but no later than the end of the calendar year in which the corresponding actual cash dividends or other distributions are paid to holders of Common Stock.

If the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is changed as a result of a stock dividend, stock split or the like, without additional consideration to the Corporation, the Performance Units subject to this Award shall be adjusted to correspond to the change in the Corporation's outstanding shares of Common Stock. If the Award Letter specifies that the Performance Units are to be paid in Shares, upon the expiration of the Performance Period and payout of the Award, the Employee may exercise voting rights and shall be entitled to receive dividends and other distributions with respect to the number of Shares to which the Employee is entitled pursuant hereto.
Rights During Performance Period
(e) . The number of Performance Units subject to the Award is based upon the assumption that the Employee shall continue to perform substantially the same duties throughout the Performance Period, and such number of Performance Units may be reduced or increased by the Board of Directors or the Board Committee or its designee without formal amendment of the Agreement to reflect a change in duties during the Performance Period.

Such pro-rata portion shall be measured by a fraction, of which the numerator is the number of days of the Performance Period during which the Employee's employment continued, and the denominator is the number of days of the Performance Period.
