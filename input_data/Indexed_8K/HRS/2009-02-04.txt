Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
On January 7, 2009, Harris Corporation (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Original Form 8-K") reporting that its majority-owned subsidiary, Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. ("Harris Stratex Networks"), had determined, based on the current global economic environment and the decline of the market capitalization of Harris Stratex Networks, it was likely that the fair value of one or more of Harris Stratex Networks reporting units had been reduced below its carrying value. As a result, Harris Stratex Networks commenced an interim review of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets relate primarily to the goodwill recorded in connection with the combination of Stratex Networks, Inc. and the Microwave Communications Division of the Company in January, 2007. The Original Form 8-K reported that the Company concurred with the preliminary findings of Harris Stratex Networks management that a significant portion of the $316 million of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets on Harris Stratex Networks balance sheet as of September 28, 2008 would be impaired as of the end of its fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2009. However, as of the filing of the Original Form 8-K, the impairment review of Harris Stratex Networks and the Company had not been completed, and therefore the Company was unable in good faith to make a determination of an estimate of the amount or range of amounts of the impairment charge. The Company is filing this Amendment No. 1 to Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to Item 2.06 to amend the Original Form 8-K to update the disclosure therein. On February 4, 2009, Harris Stratex Networks determined, and the Company concurs in such determination and therefore similarly concluded, that the impairment charge is comprised of approximately $279.0 million to write down all of the Harris Stratex Networks goodwill and $22.0 million to write down a maj ority of the carrying value of the Stratex trade name. This impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Companys Harris Stratex Networks segment will be included in the Companys consolidated financial results as of and for the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2009, with an elimination of the minority interest. Neither the Company nor Harris Stratex Networks will be required to make any current or future cash expenditures as a result of these impairments.
