Following execution of the Merger Agreement, Harris delivered the Written Consent to the Company.

Written Consent
The Merger Agreement contains customary conditions to the respective obligations of Harris and Merger Sub, on one hand, and of the Company, on the other hand, to close the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the ""), including: (1) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and under any applicable foreign antitrust law, and the making or receipt of any required filings, consents or approvals required under any applicable foreign antitrust laws, (2) the receipt of approval from each of the Federal Communications Commission, Anatel of Brazil and, if required, the Ministry of Communication and Information of Indonesia or Directorate General of Post and Telecommunications of Indonesia, in each case, for the transfer of control of the Company and its subsidiaries holding licenses subject to each such governmental entity's respective jurisdiction, (3) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company, in the case of Harris' and Merger Sub's respective obligations to close, and of Harris and Merger Sub, in the case of the Company's obligation to close, in each case subject to customary materiality exceptions and (4) the performance in all material respects by the Company, in the case of Harris' and Merger Sub's respective obligations to close, and by Harris and Merger Sub, in the case of the Company's obligation to close, in each case of its or their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. In addition, it is a condition to Harris' and Merger Sub's respective obligations to close that the holder of the Warrants and holders of equity securities of the Company who, together with the holder of the Warrants, are entitled to receive not less than 95% of the Merger Consideration, deliver certificates representing such Warrants and equity securities, as well as agreements (in the case of holders other than the Major Stockholders) to be bound by the Merger Agreement, to Harris or the Stockholder Representative on behalf of Harris.
Closing
 
Harris, Merger Sub, the Major Stockholders and the Company each have made, as the case may be, customary representations, warranties, covenants and/or indemnities in the Merger Agreement including, among others, covenants that (i) prior to the Closing, subject to certain exceptions, the Company will operate its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and (ii) each of the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary under applicable laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents and approvals of governmental entities.
The Closing is expected to occur during the first quarter of Harris' fiscal 2011. However, there can be no assurances that the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied or waived or that the Closing will occur, either during the first quarter of Harris' fiscal 2011 or at all.
In connection with the Merger Agreement, CapRock's Chief Executive Officer and certain of its other senior management entered into new employment arrangements with Harris and/or the Company, effective contingent upon the Closing. No material relationship exists between Harris or its affiliates and any of the other parties to the Merger Agreement, other than in respect of the Merger Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the representations, warranties and covenants made in the Merger Agreement by Harris, Merger Sub, the Major Stockholders and the Company are qualified by and subject to important exceptions and other limitations agreed to by the parties to the Merger Agreement in connection with negotiating the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. In particular, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which Harris and Merger Sub, on one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may have the right not to close the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement if the representations and warranties of the Company, in the case of Harris and Merger Sub, or of Harris and Merger Sub, in the case of the Company, prove not to be true and correct due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and otherwise allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than establishing the matters covered as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality very different from those generally applicable to disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws, including for reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""), and in many cases were qualified by disclosures that were made by the applicable party, which disclosures are not set forth in the body of the Merger Agreement. Also, the representations and warranties do not purport to be accurate as of the date of filing of this Form 8-K, and the subject matter thereof may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement, and any subsequent developments or new information affecting or relating to any of such representations or warranties may not have been described in this Form 8-K. Furthermore, any factual disclosures in the Merger Agreement or this Form 8-K may be supplemented, updated or modified by disclosures contained in, and should be considered in conjunction with, reports and other matters Harris files with, or furnishes to, the SEC or otherwise publicly discloses.

Exhibit 99.1
 Harris Corporation (NYSE:HRS), an international communications and information technology company, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CapRock Communications, a global provider of mission-critical managed satellite communications solutions for the energy, government and maritime industries.
MELBOURNE, FL/HOUSTON, TX, May 21, 2010
Established in 1981, CapRock provides its customers with secure, highly-reliable managed communication services including broadband Internet access, voice over IP, networking and real-time video delivered to harsh and remote locations around the world. CapRock managed network solutions include multiband, portable and fixed satellite communications services supported by its teleports and network operations centers around the globe. CapRock designs, implements and operates these sophisticated, end-to-end managed network solutions under long-term contracts.
Under the terms of the agreement, Harris will purchase privately held CapRock for $525 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. CapRock's audited financial statements for calendar year 2009 included revenue of $359 million; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $54 million; and operating income of $28 million. The acquisition is expected to be slightly accretive to Harris earnings in fiscal year 2011, excluding acquisition-related charges, and a more significant contributor to earnings in fiscal year 2012. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory reviews, FCC license approvals, and closing conditions, and it is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Harris will finance the acquisition using a combination of cash on hand, commercial paper, and borrowings under its committed credit facilities.
 
"Acquiring CapRock expands our international presence and customer base, while increasing the breadth of our offerings. We see increasing demand for outsourced managed communications services that include secure high-availability networks, creating growth opportunities across a variety of markets," said Howard L. Lance, chairman, president and CEO of Harris. "The acquisition provides an entry into the energy market, while expanding our present offering for the government and maritime markets to include managed satellite communications solutions. CapRock is a facilities-based global service provider that has made significant strategic investments in a self-owned and operated infrastructure to support demanding customer requirements. CapRock is a very successful company that shares our passion and commitment to mission-critical communications. It has an experienced management team with a track record of double-digit growth and profitability."

The company supports over 2,000 customer sites in over 120 countries around the world.
Peter Shaper, CapRock CEO, said, "The combination of CapRock and Harris will provide both commercial and government customers with a new, stronger offering to address their needs for mission-critical communications services. Bringing these two companies together will give our customers access to a combined breadth of services, depth of expertise, and unparalleled customer commitment. We are excited about this opportunity for our customers and our employees."
