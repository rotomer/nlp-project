Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 9, 2010, Howard L. Lance, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Harris Corporation ("Harris"), established a written pre-arranged plan to sell shares of Harris stock. The plan was established as part of Mr. Lances long-term strategy for asset diversification and financial, estate and tax planning activities. Mr. Lances plan is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Harris insider trading policy. The plan provides for the sale of 50,000 shares of Harris stock. Such shares will be sold on predetermined dates in September 2010, subject to early termination or suspension upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Mr. Lances ownership interest in Harris is considerably in excess of Harris stock ownership guidelines, even taking into account the sale of shares pursuant to the plan. The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals to establish pre-arranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material non-public information, and allows such pre-arranged trades to be made pursuant to the plan regardless of any subsequent material non-public information that an individual may receive. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over time. Except as may be required by law, Harris does not undertake to report any Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any other officers or directors of Harris, nor to report modifications or termination of any such plans, including Mr. Lances plan.
