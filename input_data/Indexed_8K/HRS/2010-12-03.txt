Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 30, 2010, Harris Corporation (the "Company" or "Harris") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated on behalf of themselves and the several underwriters named therein including CitiGroup Global Markets Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. (collectively, the "Underwriters") with respect to the offer and sale by the Company of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.40% Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") and of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.15% Notes due 2040 (the "2040 Notes," and together with the 2020 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes were offered and sold under the Company's automatic shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-159688) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 3, 2009 (the "Registration Statement"). The issuance and sale of the Notes closed on December 3, 2010. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses were approximately $689.7 million. The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes for: payment of all or a portion of the purchase price for its previously announced pending acquisition of the assets of the Global Connectivity Services business of the Schlumberger group from Schlumberger B.V. (if such acquisition is consummated); repayment of a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Company's commercial paper program incurred primarily in connection with the Company's acquisition of CapRock Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including CapRock Communications, Inc. (collectively, "CapRock"); and general corporate purposes.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 3, 2003 (Exhibit 4(b) to the Registration Statement) (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor to The Bank of New York, as trustee. Information concerning the Notes, the Indenture and related matters is set forth in the Registration Statement, including the Company's Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement, which Prospectus Supplement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 2, 2010.
The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company, conditions to closing, termination provisions and other terms and conditions customary in agreements of this type. The Underwriting Agreement also contains customary indemnification and contribution rights and obligations of the Company and the Underwriters.
The 2020 Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.40% per year and will mature on December 15, 2020. Interest on the 2020 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2011. The 2040 Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.15% per year and will mature on December 15, 2040. Interest on the 2040 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2011. The Company may redeem the 2020 Notes and/or the 2040 Notes at any time in whole or, from time to time, in part at the "make-whole" redemption price specified in the Prospectus Supplement for the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, upon a change of control combined with a below investment grade rating event (each as defined in the Prospectus Supplement), the Company may be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated and will rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company from time to time outstanding. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors of the Company's subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and to any future claims of secured lenders to the Company with respect to assets securing such lenders' loans to the Company.
 
From time to time, certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates have provided, and may provide, various financial advisory, investment banking, commercial banking or other services to the Company for which they have received, and will continue to receive, customary fees. In particular, Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, acted as syndication agent under the Company's senior unsecured $750 million revolving credit facility entered into on September 10, 2008, and is also a lender under the $750 million revolving credit facility and under the Company's senior unsecured $300 million 364-day revolving credit facility entered into on September 29, 2010. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. acted as lead arranger and book manager and is also a lender under the $750 million revolving credit facility and the $300 million 364-day revolving credit facility. Affiliates of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. are lenders under the $750 million revolving credit facility and the $300 million 364-day revolving credit facility. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated acted as the Company's financial advisor in connection with the Company's acquisition of CapRock, the Company's acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the Tyco Electronics wireless systems business and the Company's spin-off of Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. In addition, several of the Underwriters and their affiliated or associated persons are dealers in the Company's commercial paper program or may otherwise receive a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes in repayment of a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Company's commercial paper program.
The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement, the 2020 Notes and the 2040 Notes is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Underwriting Agreement, the form of the 2020 Notes and the form of the 2040 Notes, which are filed as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and are incorporated by reference herein and into the Registration Statement.

The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.

     (k) If at any time when Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify you, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post- effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to you, (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify you of such

The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
     (l) The Company agrees to pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) of the Securities Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Securities Act.
     7. . Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that: It has not and will not prepare or use any "free writing prospectus", as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) other than: (i) a free writing prospectus that, solely as a result of use by such Underwriter, would not trigger an obligation to file such free writing prospectus with the Commission under Rule 433, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule II or prepared pursuant to Section 6(i) above (including any electronic road show) or (iii) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance.
Covenant of the Underwriters
The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities or their offering, (ii) information permitted by Rule 134 under the Securities Act or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheets of the Company contemplated in Section 6(h) above.
     8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution
 
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by you, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and
pro rata
 
shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by you to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading shall have been fixed or maximum ranges for prices shall have been required, on or by, as the case may be, any of The New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade or the clearance or settlement of such trading generally shall been materially disrupted, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking in the United States shall have occurred or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, including any act or acts of terrorism, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses 9(a)(i) through 9(a)(iv), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to market, sell or deliver the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Termination
     10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
     If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount
provided
 
of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Disclosure Package, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
     11. . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts
     12. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
Applicable Law
