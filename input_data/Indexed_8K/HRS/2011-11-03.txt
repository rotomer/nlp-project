Item 8.01 Other Events.
DESIGNATION OF LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
As previously disclosed in the Company's 2011 proxy statement, at all times while the Company's Chairman of the Board is not independent, the Company's independent directors will designate one of the Company's independent Board members to serve as Lead Independent Director. On October 28, 2010, the Company's independent directors designated Mr. Thomas A. Dattilo to serve as Lead Independent Director until January 1, 2012. The Board designated Mr. Dattilo as Lead Independent Director primarily for continuity, in recognition of his previously disclosed appointment as non-executive Chairman of the Board to succeed the Company's current Chairman, Mr. Howard L. Lance, effective January 1, 2012. Effective January 1, 2012, no member of the Company's Board will be designated as Lead Independent Director because the Company will have an independent Chairman of the Board.
COMPENSATION OF OUTSIDE DIRECTORS
On October 27, 2011, the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board recommended for approval, and the Board approved on October 28, 2011, a one-time fee payable to the members of the special CEO Search Committee established in May 2011 for their service on such committee. The one-time fee was approved in the amounts of $25,000 for Thomas A. Dattilo, Chairperson of the CEO Search Committee, and $15,000 for each of Stephen P. Kaufman and Gregory T. Swienton.
