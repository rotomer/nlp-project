Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 12, 2011, Gary L. McArthur, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Harris Corporation ("Harris"), established a written pre-arranged plan to sell shares of Harris stock. The plan was established as part of Mr. McArthurs long-term strategy for asset diversification gradually over time and financial, estate and tax planning activities. Mr. McArthurs plan is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Harris insider trading policy. Rule 10b5-1 permits an individual to establish a plan for pre-arranged stock trades when the individual is not in possession of material non-public information, and allows such pre-arranged trades to be made pursuant to the plan regardless of any subsequent material non-public information that the individual may receive. Use of such plans facilitates gradual diversification of an investment portfolio over time. Mr. McArthurs plan provides for the sale of 12,000 shares of Harris stock. Subject to minimum price thresholds, such shares will be sold on predetermined dates starting in March 2012, subject to early termination or suspension upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Any such sales will not reduce Mr. McArthurs ownership of Harris stock below applicable Harris stock ownership guidelines for executive officers. Transactions under Mr. McArthurs plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, Harris does not undertake to report any Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any other officers or directors of Harris, nor to report modifications or termination of any such plans, including Mr. McArthurs plan.
