 Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
The information disclosed under Item 2.06 below is incorporated in this Item 2.05 by reference. At this time, Harris remains unable, in good faith, to make a determination of an estimate of the total amount or range of amounts for each major type of cost expected to be incurred in connection with the divestiture, an estimate of the total amount or range of amounts expected to be incurred in connection with the divestiture, or an estimate of the amount or range of amounts of the charges that will result in future cash expenditures.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
On May 1, 2012, Harris Corporation ("Harris") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Original Form 8-K") reporting, among other things, under Item 2.05 and Item 2.06 that on April 27, 2012, Harris' Board of Directors had approved a plan to divest Broadcast Communications (which would be classified as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012), and in connection with the approved divestiture plan, (i) Harris may incur material charges for exit and disposal activities under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), including expected tax liabilities upon disposition; and (ii) material charges for impairment to one or more of Harris' assets related to Broadcast Communications may be required under GAAP. However, at the time of the filing of the Original Form 8-K, Harris was unable, in good faith, to make a determination of the estimates required under Item 2.05 and Item 2.06. Harris is filing this Amendment No. 1 to Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to Item 2.05 and Item 2.06 to amend the Original Form 8-K to update the disclosure therein.
As previously reported under Item 1.01 in Harris' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 11, 2012, Harris entered into a definitive Asset Sale Agreement (the "Agreement") on December 5, 2012 with Gores Broadcast Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer") that is an affiliate of The Gores Group, LLC, relating to the sale of Broadcast Communications as provided in the Agreement, which Harris expects to complete in early calendar year 2013. Consequently, Harris expects to incur total estimated pre-tax charges of $80 million to $120 million ($73 million to $101 million after-tax or $0.64 to $0.89 per diluted share) for impairment of goodwill, other long-lived assets and inventory, which are expected to be reflected in Harris' results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. At this time, Harris remains unable, in good faith, to make a determination of an estimate of the amount or range of amounts of the impairment charges that will result in future cash expenditures.
The impairment charges disclosed in the preceding paragraph are in addition to the impairment charges related to Broadcast Communications disclosed in the Original Form 8-K, Harris' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 30, 2012, Harris' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2012 and Harris' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 28, 2012.
