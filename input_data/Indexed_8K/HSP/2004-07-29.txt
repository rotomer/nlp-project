Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The registrant is furnishing unaudited condensed combined statements of earnings for the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2003.  These historical results are presented on a basis consistent with the combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, included in Hospira's information statement, included as an exhibit to Hospira's registration statement on Form 10, which the SEC declared effective on April 13, 2004.  The results do not include pro forma or any other adjustments that assume the separation from Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") or costs that would be incurred to operate as an independent company.  Also provided are unaudited net sales by product line for each of the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2003.    Hospira was formed as a result of the spin-off of Abbott's core global hospital products business as a tax-free distribution to shareholders.  The spin-off was completed on April 30, 2004.
The results set forth above differ in two respects from amounts reported as Discontinued Operations by Abbott Laboratories in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 1, 2004. The results set forth above include Sales to Abbott Laboratories, which are recorded at cost, and exclude direct transaction costs incurred by Abbott in conjunction with the spin-off of Hospira.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
