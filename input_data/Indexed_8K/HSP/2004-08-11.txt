Item 12.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
                                                   
 
On August 10, 2004, Hospira, Inc. announced its results of operations for the second quarter of 2004.
 
Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Hospira announcing its second quarter results.  In that news release, Hospira uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others:  diluted earnings per common share excluding non-recurring costs and gains, net income excluding non-recurring costs and gains, income from operations excluding non-recurring costs and gains, and gross profit from operations excluding non-recurring costs and gains.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable.  Hospira's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Hospira's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Hospira's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the business.  Hospira, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

HOSPIRA REPORTS SECOND-QUARTER 2004 RESULTS
 
LAKE FOREST, Ill., Aug. 10, 2004  Hospira, Inc. (NYSE:

), one of the largest hospital products manufacturers in the United States, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004.
 
Second-Quarter 2004 Financial Summary
 
Net sales were $667.4 million, 2.8 percent higher than the second quarter of 2003.
 - 
                 
 
Net income was $125.8 million, compared to $67.5 million in the same quarter of 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $0.80 versus $0.43 in the prior year's second quarter. (All prior-year earnings per share amounts in this release are based on shares outstanding at the date of the spin-off.)
 - 
                 
 
Included in earnings is a one-time, non-cash curtailment gain of $0.26 per share related to the discontinuance of one of Hospira's U.S. post-retirement employee benefit programs, and non-recurring transition expenses of $0.02 per share related to building the company's independent infrastructure.
 - 
                 
 
"We are encouraged by the results we posted this quarter, our first quarter as a stand-alone company," said Christopher B. Begley, chief executive officer, Hospira. "Our financial results are consistent with our expectations, our transition-related activities are on track, and we are executing the tactics necessary to support the business."
 
Begley continued, "Strategically and financially, we are laying the groundwork for long-term success, and I applaud our 14,000 employees around the world for their hard work and commitment to delivering solid results."
 
Second-Quarter Highlights
 
On April 30, 2004, the company became an independent, public company as a result of its spin-off from Abbott Laboratories. Among the quarter's accomplishments:
 
 - 
                 
Began trading as HSP on the New York Stock Exchange on May 3.
 
 - 
                 
Completed a $700 million bond issuance, thereby setting long-term fixed rates for the company's debt that are below historical averages for these maturities.
 
 - 
                 
Acquired a 100,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Clayton, N.C., providing Hospira with additional capacity in emulsion technology.
 
 - 
                 
Amended Hospira's existing medication management (pump) agreement with Consorta to enable its members to sign multi-year agreements with Hospira that could extend beyond the current contract's Aug. 31, 2007, end date.
 - 
                 
Launched a new generic injectable drug, deferoxamine mesylate, adding to Hospira's position as the leading provider of generic injectable pharmaceuticals in the United States.
 
 - 
                 
Completed the process started earlier this year with Novation on Hospira's pharmacy contract, and secured its renewal. The contract represents more than $200 million in potential annual sales for the company's generic injectable pharmaceuticals.
 
 - 
                 
Proceeded on schedule with transition plans, including selection of the site for the company's research and development (R&D) facility, initiation of the build-out of a new information technology (IT) infrastructure, and establishment of Hospira's international leadership structure.
 
Financial and Operating Review
 
Results for the second quarter of 2004 include one month's results when the company was part of Abbott and two months' results as an independent, public company; the second quarter of 2003 are results for the business operated as a part of Abbott. Results for 2003 do not include any of the ongoing, incremental costs of being a stand-alone public company or any non-recurring transition costs.
Certain results in this press release are discussed on both a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, referred to as "adjusted" in this release, exclude the one-time curtailment gain, described in more detail below, and the non-recurring transition costs associated with establishing a stand-alone infrastructure for the company. Additional information is provided in the section, "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," contained in this release.
 
Consolidated net sales in the second quarter of 2004 increased 2.8 percent to $667.4 million, compared to $649.3 million in the second quarter of 2003. All of the major product line categories reported increases, except sales to Abbott, which reflects primarily a change in how these sales to Abbott are reported. (A schedule detailing sales by product line for the second quarter and first six months of 2004 and 2003 is attached to this press release.) Net sales in the second quarter were favorably affected by foreign currency translation of $4.5 million. On a local currency basis, net sales increased 2.1 percent, primarily from volume increases.
Gross profit in the quarter was $210.6 million, an increase of 20.4 percent from $174.9 million in the same period last year. The gross margin in the second quarter of 2004 was 31.6 percent, compared to 26.9 percent in the prior year's second quarter. Adjusted* gross profit was $211.5 million in the second quarter of 2004, or 31.7 percent of sales. The gross margin increase on both an adjusted and GAAP basis was attributable to improved product mix, inclusion of a profit on sales to Abbott subsequent to the spin-off, and lower freight and distribution costs, modestly offset by lower prices.  In 2003, sales to Abbott were recorded at cost. In addition, the gross margin in the second quarter of 2003 was negatively affected by the costs associated with a product recall.
 
Research and development costs rose 17.4 percent in the quarter to $28.1 million, or 4.2 percent of sales, compared to $23.9 million, or 3.7 percent of sales, in last year's second quarter. This increase is consistent with the company's strategy to increase R&D spending to fund internal growth, especially in specialty injectable pharmaceuticals and medication management systems.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the quarter was $66.9 million, up 23.4 percent from $54.2 million in the 2003 quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 10.0 percent in the second quarter of 2004, compared to 8.4 percent last year. Adjusted* SG&A expense in the second quarter of 2004 was $63.4 million, or 9.5 percent of sales. As expected, the increase in the adjusted* SG&A was driven primarily by the ongoing, incremental costs associated with being an independent, public company that were not required when this business was part of Abbott.
In the second quarter of 2004 Hospira recorded a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax curtailment gain of $64.6 million ($40.4 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax). In order to better align its benefits cost structure with other companies of its size and financial profile  while maintaining a competitive and well-rounded benefits portfolio  the company reconfigured its employee benefits programs, including the discontinuation of one of its U.S. post-retirement medical and dental benefit programs. The reversal of the related liability resulted in the gain.
 
Income from operations in the quarter was $180.2 million, compared to $96.7 million in the second quarter of 2003. Adjusted* income from operations in the quarter was $120.1 million, an increase of 24.1 percent compared to $96.7 million in the second quarter of 2003. The adjusted* operating margin for the 2004 quarter was 18.0 percent, compared to 14.9 percent in 2003.
 
Interest expense for the second quarter of 2004 was $2.7 million, compared to no interest expense in 2003. The increase is due to the addition of debt, in the form of short-term borrowings and senior unsecured notes. The majority of the debt was incurred at the time of the spin-off.
Net income in the quarter was $125.8 million, compared to $67.5 million in the second quarter of 2003. Adjusted* net income for the quarter grew 31.7 percent to $88.9 million from $67.5 million in the prior year. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2004 was 29.0 percent, compared to 29.5 percent last year. The adjusted* tax rate for the quarter was 24.0 percent, as the company derived a greater portion of income from operations in jurisdictions with tax exemptions.
 
Results by Geographic Segment
 
Net sales in the United States grew 1.7 percent to $555 million in the quarter, from $546 million in the same quarter of 2003. Income from operations in the second quarter of 2004 was $160 million, compared to $79 million last year. Income from operations in 2004 included the $64.6 million one-time curtailment gain.
 
In the International segment, net sales were $112 million, an 8.5 percent increase over last year's $103 million. Excluding the $4.5 million benefit from foreign currency translation, net sales in the segment increased 4.2 percent. Income from operations in the second quarter of 2004 was $34 million, compared to $27 million in the same quarter of 2003.
Six-Month Results
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, consolidated net sales increased 0.5 percent to $1.29 billion, compared to $1.28 billion in the same period of 2003. Net sales were favorably affected by foreign currency translation of $13.7 million. On a local currency basis, net sales decreased 0.6 percent.
 
Net income was $190.8 million, compared to $134.6 million in the first six months of 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $1.22, compared to $0.86 last year. Adjusted* net income was $154.2 million, compared to $134.6 million last year. Adjusted* diluted earnings per share in the first six months of 2004 were $0.98, compared to $0.86 last year.
 
Cash Flow Items
 
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2004 was approximately $220 million. The company's projection for the full year remains in the $300 million to $350 million range.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $69.8 million for the first six months of 2004, compared to $66.0 million for the same period of 2003.
Capital expenditures were $108.3 million year to date in 2004, compared to $72.1 million for the first six months of 2003. The increase is due to the capacity expansion at the company's McPherson, Kan., facility, and spending related to building the infrastructure for an independent, stand-alone company. Capital expenditures for the full year are expected to be in the $250 million to $275 million range.
 
Full-Year Outlook
 
For the year ended Dec. 31, 2004, Hospira still expects sales to be approximately $2.5 billion, based on foreseeable demand for its products. Diluted earnings per share for the year, which will include four months' results as a part of Abbott and eight months' results as an independent, public company are projected to be as follows:
 
*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP in the United States included within this press release, Hospira has provided certain information that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. As used in this press release, "adjusted" refers to operating performance measures that exclude the non-recurring transition expenses related to becoming an independent, stand-alone company and the one-time curtailment gain discussed above.
 
The adjusted information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Rules and is included in the attached supplemental data.
 
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and its shareholders in their analysis of the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Management also uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Hospira may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In the second quarter of 2004, Hospira incurred non-recurring transition pre-tax expenses of $4.6 million ($3.5 million, or $0.02 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. Year to date, these expenses were $5.1 million ($3.8 million, or $0.02 per share, after tax). The company has previously stated that these non-recurring transitional expenses will total approximately $100 million over the 24-month period ending April 30, 2006.
