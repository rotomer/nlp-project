Results of Operations and Financial Condition
                                         
 
On November 9, 2004, Hospira, Inc. announced its results of operations for the third quarter of 2004.
 
Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Hospira announcing its third quarter results.  In that news release, Hospira uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others:  diluted earnings per common share excluding non-recurring costs and gains; net income excluding non-recurring costs and gains; income from operations excluding non-recurring costs and gains; selling, general and administrative expenses excluding non-recurring costs and gains; and gross profit from operations excluding non-recurring costs and gains.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable.  Hospira's management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Hospira's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance.  Hospira's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally for operational planning and decision-making purposes.  Hospira, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
LAKE FOREST, Ill., Nov. 9, 2004  Hospira, Inc. (NYSE:HSP), one of the largest hospital products manufacturers in the United States, today reported results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2004.
 
Third-Quarter 2004 Financial Summary
 
Net sales were $656.1 million, 1.0 percent higher than the third quarter of 2003. Included in the 2003 third-quarter sales is an $8.0 million gain from the sale of the product rights to paclitaxel.
 - 
                 
 
Net income was $61.3 million, compared to $66.8 million in the same quarter of 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $0.39 versus $0.43 in the prior year's third quarter. (All prior-year earnings per share amounts in this release are based on shares outstanding at the date of the spin-off.)
 - 
                 
 
Included in earnings are non-recurring transition expenses of $0.05 per share related to building the company's independent infrastructure.
 - 
                 
 
"We have continued the positive course we began last quarter as a stand-alone public company," said Christopher B. Begley, chief executive officer, Hospira. "We performed above our expectations, in part because of unusually strong sales in our specialty injectable pharmaceuticals and contract manufacturing product lines. Our earnings favorability, relative to our projections, also was due to timing issues  including the delay in ramping up the ongoing, incremental expenses required for our independent structure, and timing on certain research and development (R&D) expenses that will now occur in 2005."
 
Third-Quarter Events
 
Launched in the United States the generic drug fluconazole on the day of patent expiration, capturing an estimated initial injectables market share of more than 40 percent.

 -

Financial and Operating Review
 
Results for the third quarter of 2004 reflect the company's new status as an independent public company; the third quarter of 2003 reflects results for the business operated as a part of Abbott (prior to the April 30, 2004, spin-off of Hospira). Results for 2003 do not include any of the ongoing, incremental costs of being a stand-alone public company or any non-recurring transition costs.
 
Certain results in this press release are discussed on both a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, referred to as "adjusted" in the text of this release, exclude the non-recurring transition costs associated with establishing an independent, stand-alone infrastructure for the company. Additional information is provided in the section, "Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures," contained in this press release.
 
Consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2004 increased 1.0 percent to $656.1 million, compared to $649.3 million in the third quarter of 2003. The specialty injectable pharmaceuticals and contract manufacturing product lines reported particularly strong sales. (A schedule detailing sales by product line for the third quarter and first nine months of 2004 and 2003 is attached to this press release.)
In the third quarter, net sales to third parties were favorably affected by volume and mix, representing 4.5 percentage points of growth, partially offset by lower prices (0.7 percentage points). Foreign currency translation contributed $3.4 million, or 0.5 percentage points, and sales to Abbott represented a decline (2.1 percentage points). Subsequent to the spin-off, the sales to Abbott exclude the bulk drug costs for certain products. In addition, the gain on the sale of the paclitaxel product rights in the third quarter of 2003 negatively affected sales growth (1.2 percentage points).
 
Gross profit in the quarter was $193.8 million, an increase of 7.7 percent from $180.0 million in the same period last year. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2004 was 29.5 percent, compared to 27.7 percent in the prior year's third quarter. Adjusted* gross profit was $195.1 million in the third quarter of 2004, or 29.7 percent of sales. The adjusted* gross margin increase was attributable to improved volume and product mix, which accounted for 1.4 percentage points of the improvement, and the inclusion of a profit on the sales to Abbott subsequent to the spin-off, which represented 1.8 percentage points. (Sales to Abbott were recorded at cost in 2003.) These favorable items were modestly offset by lower prices, which reduced the gross margin by 0.5 percentage points. In addition, the gross margin in the third quarter of 2003 was positively impacted by an $8 million gain on the sale of the product rights to paclitaxel (0.9 percentage points).
Research and development costs decreased 5.8 percent in the quarter to $28.0 million, or 4.3 percent of sales, compared to $29.7 million, or 4.6 percent of sales, in last year's third quarter. The decline in spending occurred due to a decrease in the cost of benefits related to previously announced changes to certain employee post-retirement programs. Also, results for the third quarter of 2003 included higher spending for external contracted services for specific compliance projects.
 
Selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expense in the quarter was $71.9 million, up 26.3 percent from $56.9 million in the 2003 quarter. As a percentage of sales, S,G&A was 11.0 percent in the third quarter of 2004, compared to 8.8 percent in 2003. Adjusted* S,G&A expense in the third quarter of 2004 was $63.6 million, or 9.7 percent of sales. As expected, the increase in the adjusted* S,G&A was driven by the ongoing, incremental costs associated with being an independent, public company that were not required when the business was part of Abbott, partially offset by the savings from the announced changes in certain employee post-retirement programs.
 
Income from operations in the quarter was $93.9 million, compared to $93.4 million in the third quarter of 2003. Adjusted* income from operations in the quarter was $103.7 million, an increase of 11.1 percent over the third quarter of 2003. The adjusted* operating margin for the third quarter of 2004 was 15.8 percent, compared to 14.4 percent in 2003. The increase was primarily driven by the improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher S,G&A spending.
Interest expense in the third quarter of 2004 was $8.3 million, compared to no interest expense in 2003. The increase was due to the addition of debt, in the form of senior unsecured notes. This debt was a result of the refinancing of the initial credit facility that was incurred at the time of the spin-off.
 
Net income in the quarter was $61.3 million, compared to $66.8 million in the third quarter of 2003. Adjusted* net income for the quarter increased 2.4 percent to $68.5 million from $66.8 million in 2003. The tax rate for the third quarter of 2004 was 30.5 percent, compared to 29.5 percent in 2003. The company is now projecting the full-year tax rate to be 26.0 percent, excluding the impact of the curtailment gain in the second quarter, which was tax-effected at the statutory rate. This is an increase from the previously projected rate of 24.0 percent, as a greater mix of income is now anticipated to be sourced from the United States rather than from lower tax-rate jurisdictions.  As a result, the 2004 third-quarter tax rate reflects the adjustment necessary to provide for income taxes at a 26.0 percent rate through the first nine months of 2004, excluding the impact of the curtailment gain.
 
Results by Geographic Segment
 
Net sales in the United States grew 0.7 percent in the third quarter of 2004 to $557 million, from $553 million in the same quarter of 2003. Income from operations in the third quarter of 2004 was $89 million, compared to $83 million last year.
In the International segment, net sales were $99 million, a 2.9 percent increase over last year's $96 million. Excluding the $3.4 million benefit from foreign currency translation, net sales in the segment decreased less than 1 percent. Income from operations in the third quarter of 2004 was $22 million, compared to $20 million in the same quarter of 2003.
 
Nine-Month Results
 
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2004, consolidated net sales increased 0.7 percent to $1.95 billion, compared to $1.93 billion in the same period of 2003. Net sales were favorably affected by foreign currency translation of $17.1 million. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, net sales decreased less than 1 percent.
 
Net income was $252.1 million, compared to $201.5 million in the first nine months of 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $1.61, compared to $1.29 last year. Adjusted* net income was $222.7 million, compared to $201.5 million last year. Adjusted* diluted earnings per share in the first nine months of 2004 were $1.42, compared to $1.29 last year.
 
Cash Flow Items
 
Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of 2004 was approximately $286 million. The company's projection for the full year remains in the $300 million to $350 million range.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $103.1 million for the first nine months of 2004, compared to $101.9 million for the same period of 2003. Depreciation and amortization for 2004 is estimated to be $140 million to $145 million.
 
Capital expenditures were $168.7 million for the first nine months of 2004, compared to $128.7 million for the same period of 2003. The increase is due to the capacity expansion at the company's McPherson, Kan., facility, and spending related to building the infrastructure for an independent, stand-alone company, primarily for the new information technology (I.T.) infrastructure. Capital expenditures for the full year are expected to be approximately $250 million.
 
Berlex Contract Wind-down
 
During the fourth quarter of 2004, Hospira received notification from Berlex that it was exercising the "wind-down" clause in its agreement with Hospira to distribute Berlex's imaging agents. This low-margin distribution contract, which expires at the end of 2005, contains a provision that enables Berlex to begin shifting distribution of its products from Hospira to another party prior to the expiration of the contract.  The parties disagree as to when the wind-down period commenced.  Berlex has initiated the alternative dispute resolution provision of the contract to resolve this disagreement.
Based upon Hospira's interpretation of the contract, Hospira projects that its sales of these products will decline from approximately $200 million in 2004 to approximately $60 million to $70 million in 2005. In addition, operating profits in 2005 related to these reduced sales are expected to be negatively affected by approximately $8 million to $9 million.
 
Full-Year Outlook
 
Based on year-to-date performance and expectations for the 2004 fourth quarter, the company has revised its 2004 projections. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2004, Hospira now expects sales to be approximately $2.6 billion. Diluted earnings per share for the year, which will include four months' results as a part of Abbott and eight months' results as an independent, public company are projected to be as follows:
 
The primary factors that resulted in the change in guidance are as follows:
 
 
It is anticipated that the other benefits to 2004 earnings  including the higher than expected growth in revenue this year and favorability in interest expense  will be offset by increased investment spending in 2004, the majority of which will occur in the fourth quarter.
 
2005 Comments
 
Hospira continues to work on completing its 2005 plan and will provide specific guidance when this planning process is concluded. However, based upon the factors disclosed in this press release and previously publicly disclosed by Hospira, the company does not expect 2005 earnings to exceed current 2004 guidance for adjusted* earnings per share.
*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP in the United States included within this press release, Hospira has provided certain information that is considered non-GAAP financial measures. As used in this press release, "adjusted" refers to operating performance measures that exclude the non-recurring transition expenses related to becoming an independent, stand-alone company for the third quarter and first nine months of 2004 and the one-time curtailment gain reported in the results for the first nine months of 2004.
 
The adjusted information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Rules and is included in the attached supplemental data.
 
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and its investors in their analysis of the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Management also uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Hospira may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In the third quarter of 2004, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $9.8 million ($7.1 million, or $0.05 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. Year-to-date, these expenses were $14.9 million ($11.0 million, or $0.07 per share, after tax). The company has previously stated that these non-recurring transitional expenses will total approximately $100 million over the 24-month period ending April 30, 2006.  The year-to-date results also include the one-time, non-cash curtailment gain of $64.6 million ($40.4 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) recorded in the second quarter of 2004.
