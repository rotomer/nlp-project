"We finished our first year as a public company on a strong note, delivering sales and earnings growth higher than we anticipated," said Christopher B. Begley, chief executive officer, Hospira. "While building on the momentum generated in 2004, we are still in a period of transition, and our focus in 2005 is on execution. We'll continue to take the steps necessary to advance our success  creating an independent infrastructure and increasing our research and development investment to drive future growth."
 
Financial and Operating Review
 
Results for the fourth quarter of 2004 and for the portion of 2004 after the spin-off on April 30, 2004, reflect the company's status as an independent public company; the fourth quarter of 2003 and the portion of 2004 prior to the spin-off reflect results for the business operated as a part of Abbott Laboratories. Results for 2003 do not include any of the ongoing, incremental costs of being a stand-alone public company or any non-recurring transition costs.
Certain results in this press release are discussed on both a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, referred to as "adjusted" in the text of this release, exclude the non-recurring transition costs associated with establishing an independent, stand-alone infrastructure for the company and the one-time curtailment gain recognized by the company in the second quarter of 2004 related to the discontinuance of one of Hospira's U.S. post-retirement employee benefit programs. A reconciliation of the adjusted financial information to the most comparable GAAP measurement is provided in the section, "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," contained in this press release.
 
Consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 increased 1.2 percent to $700.3 million, compared to $692.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The fourth quarter of 2004 includes an adjustment to net sales of approximately $14 million related to prior periods resulting from the reclassification of certain drug delivery pump leases from operating to sales-type leases. (A schedule detailing sales by product line for the fourth quarter, full-year 2004 and 2003 is attached to this press release.)
In the fourth quarter, net sales to third parties were favorably affected by volume and mix (including the pump lease adjustment), representing 2.3 percentage points of the growth in consolidated net sales, and by foreign currency translation, which contributed $4.9 million, or 0.7 percentage point. This growth was partially offset by a decline in the sales to Abbott, which represented a decrease of 1.8 percentage points. Subsequent to the spin-off, the sales to Abbott exclude the bulk drug costs for certain products, which had been included in sales to Abbott before the spin-off.
 
Gross profit in the quarter was $213.8 million, an increase of 24.0 percent from $172.4 million in the same period last year. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2004 was 30.5 percent, compared to 24.9 percent in the prior year's fourth quarter. Adjusted* gross profit was $216.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, or 30.9 percent of sales. The adjusted* gross margin increase was attributable to:
 
 - 
                 
Improved volume and product mix  1.8 percentage points, of which 0.5 percentage point is attributable to the pump lease adjustment
 
 - 
                 
The inclusion of a profit on the sales to Abbott subsequent to the spin-off  1.7 percentage points (Sales to Abbott were recorded at cost in 2003.)
 
 - 
                 
Impact of changes in certain employee post-retirement benefit programs  1.2 percentage points
 
 - 
                 
Lower project expense in 2004  1.3 percentage points
Research and development (R&D) expense rose 6.4 percent in the quarter to $39.0 million, or 5.6 percent of sales, compared to $36.7 million, or 5.3 percent of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2003. The company continues to increase its investment in R&D as part of its long-term strategy to drive higher sales growth.
 
Selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expense in the quarter was $107.7 million, compared to $63.0 million in the 2003 quarter. As a percentage of sales, S,G&A was 15.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to 9.1 percent in 2003. Adjusted* S,G&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $92.7 million, or 13.2 percent of sales. As expected, the increase in the adjusted* S,G&A was driven by the ongoing, incremental costs associated with being an independent, public company that were not required when the business was part of Abbott, partially offset by the savings from the announced changes in certain employee post-retirement benefit programs. In addition, in the fourth quarter the company continued to invest a portion of its higher-than-planned profitability in targeted marketing, sales training and other programs, which contributed to the increased S,G&A expense.
Income from operations in the quarter was $67.1 million, compared to $72.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Adjusted* income from operations in the quarter was $84.7 million, an increase of 16.4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2003. The operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 9.6 percent and the adjusted* operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 12.1 percent, compared to 10.5 percent for the same period in 2003. The increase was attributable to the improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher R&D and S,G&A spending.
 
Interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $7.8 million, compared to no interest expense in the same period of 2003. The increase was due to interest paid on the senior unsecured notes, which were issued earlier in 2004.
 
Net income in the quarter was $49.5 million, compared to $58.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Adjusted* net income for the quarter increased 6.8 percent to $62.9 million from $58.9 million in 2003. The tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 18.6 percent, compared to 19.7 percent in 2003. The tax rate for the 2004 full year was 24.7 percent, excluding the impact of the second quarter curtailment gain, which was tax-effected at the statutory rate.  This full-year rate is a decrease from the previously projected rate of 26.0 percent, primarily due to a larger proportion of income sourced from lower tax-rate jurisdictions. As a result, the fourth-quarter tax rate reflects the adjustment necessary to provide for income taxes at the 24.7 percent rate for the full year, excluding the impact of the curtailment gain.
  
Results by Geographic Segment
 
Net sales in the United States grew 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 to $587 million, from $570 million in the same quarter of 2003. Income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $78 million, compared to $67 million last year.
 
In the International segment, net sales were $113 million, a 7.1 percent decline from last year's higher-than-normal $122 million. Excluding the $4.9 million benefit from foreign currency translation, net sales in the segment decreased 11.1 percent. Income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $15 million, compared to $21 million in the same quarter of 2003.
 
Full-Year 2004 Results
 
For the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2004, consolidated net sales increased 0.8 percent to $2.65 billion, compared to $2.62 billion in 2003. Net sales were favorably affected by foreign currency translation of $22.0 million. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, net sales were $2.62 billion.
 
Net income for the year was $301.6 million, compared to $260.4 million in 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $1.92, compared to $1.67 last year. Adjusted* net income was $285.6 million, compared to $260.4 million last year. Adjusted* diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $1.82.
Cash Flow Items
 
Cash flow from operations for 2004 was approximately $387 million.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $145.5 million for 2004, compared to $145.9 million for 2003.
 
Capital expenditures were $228.9 million for 2004, compared to $196.7 million for 2003. The increase is due to the capacity expansion at the company's McPherson, Kan., facility, and spending related to building the infrastructure for an independent, stand-alone company, primarily for new information technology systems.
 
Updated 2005 Projections
 
Hospira continues to project that revenue for the fiscal year 2005 will be approximately $2.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.21 to $1.28, including estimated non-recurring transition expenses described below and the charge we expect to take in connection with our previously announced transaction with ICU Medical. On Feb. 28, 2005, we announced that we entered into a manufacturing, commercialization and development agreement with ICU Medical to sell them certain assets and announced that we would be taking a charge relating to the transaction of approximately $20 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005.
Adjusted* diluted earnings per share for 2005, which exclude the non-recurring transition expenses and the charge relating to the ICU Medical transaction, are projected to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.60.
 
The reconciliation between the projected adjusted* diluted earnings per share and earnings per share on a GAAP basis is:
 
 
The earnings per share projection on both a GAAP and adjusted basis also do not include any effect of the accounting standard recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) related to expensing of stock options or the effect of any future decision to repatriate foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP in the United States included within this press release, Hospira has provided certain information that is considered non-GAAP financial measures. As used in this press release, "adjusted" refers to operating performance measures that exclude the non-recurring transition expenses related to becoming an independent, stand-alone company for the fourth quarter and 12 months of 2004 and the one-time curtailment gain reported in the results for the 12 months of 2004, and for purposes of the 2005 projections, the exclusion of the charge expected to be taken in connection with the ICU Medical transaction as well as expected non-recurring transition expenses.
 
The adjusted information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Rules and is included in the attached supplemental data.
 
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and its investors in their analysis of the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Management also uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Hospira may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $17.6 million ($13.4 million, or $0.09 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. For the 2004 full year, these expenses were $32.4 million ($24.4 million, or $0.16 per share, after tax). The company has previously stated that these non-recurring transitional expenses are expected to total approximately $100 million over the 24-month period ending April 30, 2006. The 2004 results also include the one-time, non-cash curtailment gain of $64.6 million ($40.4 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) recorded in the second quarter of 2004.
