HOSPIRA 2004 LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
NQSO TERMS
The Participant specified below has been granted this Option by Hospira, Inc. (the "Company") under the terms of the Hospira 2004 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan").  The Option shall be subject to the following terms and conditions (the "Option Terms"):
1.             .  The following words and phrases relating to the grant of the Option shall have the following meanings:

(c)           The number of "Covered Shares" shall be shares of Stock.
                                 
(d)           The "Exercise Price" is $ per share.
                   
Except where the context clearly implies to the contrary, any capitalized term in this award shall have the meaning ascribed to that term under the Plan.
2.             .  The Option is not intended to constitute an "incentive stock option" as that term is used in Code section 422.
Non-Qualified Stock Option
3.             .  Subject to the limitations of the Option Terms, on the first anniversary of the Grant Date one-third of the Covered Shares subject to These Options (rounded up) may be purchased; on the second anniversary of the Grant Date two-thirds of the Covered Shares subject to These Options (rounded up) may be purchased; and on the third anniversary of the Grant Date these Options may be exercised in full, provided the Expiration Date has not occurred prior to such vesting dates.
Date of Exercise
(a)           Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 3, the Option shall become fully exercisable upon a Change in Control that occurs on or before the Date of Termination.
(b)           The Option may be exercised (prior to or following the Date of Termination) only as to that portion of the Covered Shares which may be purchased under the foregoing schedule, as of the date of exercise.
(c)           The Covered Shares shall continue to become exercisable pursuant to this Section 3 until the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 4).
(d)           Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 3, in the event of termination of employment for reasons other than death, Disability or Retirement, the
 
 
Option may only be exercised on or after the Date of Termination only as to that portion of the Covered Shares for which it was exercisable immediately prior to the Date of Termination, or became exercisable on the Date of Termination.
4.             .  The Option shall not be exercisable after the Company's close of business on the last business day that occurs prior to the Expiration Date.  The "Expiration Date" shall be the earliest to occur of:
Expiration

(b)           if the termination of employment occurs for reasons other than death, Disability (as defined in Section 8) or Retirement (as defined in Section 8), the three-month anniversary of the Date of Termination (as defined in Section 8); provided, however, that if the Participant dies during such three month period following the Date of Termination, then the three-month anniversary of the date of death;
(c)           the date on which the Participant engages in conduct which constitutes Cause; or
(d)           the date on which the Participant, at any time prior to the one-year anniversary of the Date of Termination, engages, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the Participant or others, in any activity, employment or business which, in the sole opinion and discretion of the Committee, is competitive with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
5.             .  Subject to the Option Terms and the Plan, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by filing a written notice with the Secretary of the Company at its corporate headquarters prior to the Company's close of business on the last business day that occurs prior to the Expiration Date.  Such notice shall specify the number of shares of Stock which the Participant elects to purchase, and shall be accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price for such shares of Stock indicated by the Participant's election. Payment may be by cash or by check payable to the Company, or except as otherwise provided by the Committee before the Option is exercised: (i) all or a portion of the Exercise Price may be paid by the Participant by delivery of shares of Stock (by actual delivery or by attestation) owned by the Participant and acceptable to the Committee having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; and (ii) the Participant may pay the Exercise Price by authorizing a third party to sell shares of Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise.  Except as otherwise provided by the Committee prior to exercise, payments made with shares of Stock in accordance with clause (i) above shall be limited to shares held by the Participant for not less than six months prior to the payment date.  The Option shall not be exercisable if and to the extent the Company determines that such exercise would violate applicable state or Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange on which the Stock is traded and shall not be exercisable during any blackout period established by the Company from time to time.
Method of Option Exercise
 
6.             .  The exercise of the Option is subject to withholding of all applicable taxes.

Withholding
7.             .  The Option is not transferable by the Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and during the Participant's life, may be exercised only by the Participant.
