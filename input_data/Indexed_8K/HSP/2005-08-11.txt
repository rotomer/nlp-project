Financial and Operating Review
 
Results for the second quarter of 2005 reflect the company's status as an independent public company; the second quarter of 2004 reflects results for the business operated as a part of Abbott Laboratories for the month of April and as a stand-alone business in May and June.
 
Certain results in this press release are discussed on both a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. A description and reconciliation of the adjusted financial information to the most comparable GAAP measurement is provided in the section "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained in this press release.
Consolidated net sales in the second quarter of 2005 decreased 0.8 percent to $661.9 million, compared to $667.4 million in the second quarter of 2004. A schedule detailing sales by product line for the second quarter and first six months of 2005 and 2004 is attached to this press release.
 
In the second quarter of 2005, compared to the same quarter of 2004, consolidated net sales were negatively affected 1.0 percentage point by the decline in sales to Abbott. The decline resulted from the exclusion of the bulk drug cost for certain products subsequent to the spin-off, and decreased demand. Consolidated net sales were favorably affected 0.2 percentage points by growth in sales to third parties, driven by:
 
Volume and mix (excluding Berlex)  3.1 percentage points,
 - 
                 
 
Favorable pricing  1.5 percentage points,
 - 
                 
 
Foreign currency translation  0.6 percentage points, and
 - 
                 
 
Wind-down of the Berlex agreement to distribute its imaging agents  (5.0) percentage points.
 - 
                 
 
The "wind-down" of the company's agreement to distribute the low-margin Berlex imaging agents was completed in the second quarter, and no additional sales are expected to be generated during the remainder of the year.
Gross profit in the quarter was $218.4 million, an increase of 3.7 percent from $210.6 million in the same period last year. Gross margin in the second quarter of 2005 was 33.0 percent, compared to 31.6 percent in the prior year's second quarter. Adjusted* gross profit was $233.6 million in the second quarter of 2005, or 35.3 percent of sales, compared to $211.5 million in the same quarter of 2004, or 31.7 percent of sales. The adjusted* gross margin increase was primarily attributable to:
 
Wind-down of the Berlex agreement  1.3 percentage points,
 - 
                 
 
Improved volume and mix (excluding Berlex)  1.2 percentage points,
 - 
                 
 
Favorable pricing on sales  1.0 percentage points, and
 - 
                 
 
Inclusion of a profit on the sales to Abbott subsequent to the spin-off  0.6 percentage points. (Sales to Abbott were recorded at cost for the month of April in the second quarter of 2004.)
 - 
                 
 
The increases were partially offset by additional depreciation of (0.5) percentage points resulting from the 2004 revision in the estimated useful life for certain drug delivery pumps placed with customers.
 
Research and development (R&D) expense rose 17.0 percent in the quarter to $32.9 million, or 5.0 percent of sales, compared to $28.1 million, or 4.2 percent of sales, in the second quarter of 2004. The company continues to increase its investment in R&D as part of its stated strategy to build its new product pipeline to drive longer-term sales growth.
Selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expense in the quarter was $87.4 million, compared to $66.9 million in the 2004 second quarter. As a percentage of sales, S,G&A was 13.2 percent in the second quarter of 2005, compared to 10.0 percent in 2004. Adjusted* S,G&A expense in the second quarter of 2005 was $79.2 million, or 12.0 percent of sales, compared to $63.4 million in the second quarter of 2004, or 9.5 percent of sales. As expected, the increase in the adjusted* S,G&A primarily was driven by the ongoing, incremental costs associated with being an independent, public company that were not required when the business was part of Abbott.
 
Income from operations in the quarter was $98.2 million, compared to $180.2 million in the second quarter of 2004, which included a one-time, non-cash curtailment gain of $64.6 million related to the previously discussed benefit change. The operating margin for the second quarter of 2005 was 14.8 percent, compared to 27.0 percent for the same period in 2004. Adjusted* income from operations in the quarter was $121.7 million, an increase of 1.4 percent from $120.1 million in the second quarter of 2004. The adjusted* operating margin for the second quarter of 2005 was 18.4 percent, compared to 18.0 percent in 2004. The increase was attributable to the improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher R&D and S,G&A spending.
 
Interest expense in the second quarter of 2005 was $6.9 million, compared to $2.7 million in interest expense in the same period of 2004. The 2005 quarter reflects a full quarter of interest expense on Hospira's outstanding senior unsecured notes. In the second quarter of 2004, Hospira only incurred interest for the months of May and June, at lower average interest rates.
Other income was $3.5 million in the quarter, compared to other expense of $0.5 million for 2004. The majority of the change is due to higher interest income earned on cash balances. Prior to the spin-off, Hospira, as part of Abbott, did not hold cash.
 
Net income in the quarter was $72.0 million, compared to $125.8 million in the second quarter of 2004. Adjusted* net income for the quarter increased 1.1 percent to $89.9 million, from $88.9 million in 2004.  The tax rate for the second quarter of 2005 was 24.0 percent, compared to 24.0 percent, excluding the impact of the one-time curtailment gain, in the same quarter of 2004.
 
Results by Geographic Segment
 
Net sales in the United States decreased 1.1 percent in the second quarter of 2005 to $549.4 million, from $555.5 million in the same quarter of 2004, reflecting the impact of the "wind-down" of the Berlex agreement, partially offset by other volume and mix gains. Income from operations in the second quarter of 2005 was $92.7 million, compared to $159.5 million last year, which included the one-time, non-cash curtailment gain of $64.6 million.
In the International segment, net sales were $112.5 million, a 0.6 percent increase from last year's $111.9 million, due to the benefit of foreign exchange. Excluding the $4.0 million benefit from foreign currency translation, net sales in the segment declined 3.1 percent, primarily due to lower third-party sales. Income from operations in the second quarter of 2005 was $20.5 million, compared to $34.5 million in the same quarter of 2004.
 
Six-Month Results
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, consolidated net sales increased 2.7 percent to $1.32 billion, compared to $1.29 billion in the same period of 2004. Net sales were favorably affected by foreign currency translation of $8.1 million. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, net sales increased 2.1 percent.
 
Net income was $149.2 million, compared to $190.8 million in the first six months of 2004. Diluted earnings per share were $0.93, compared to $1.22 last year. Adjusted* net income was $177.1 million, compared to $154.2 million last year. Adjusted* diluted earnings per share in the first six months of 2005 were $1.11, compared to $0.98 in the prior year.
 
Cash Flow Items
 
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2005 was $300.2 million, compared to $219.6 million in last year's same period.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $80.5 million for the first six months, compared to $69.8 million for the same period in 2004. The increase is due to higher levels of capital spending and increased depreciation related to the change in the fourth quarter of 2004 in the estimated useful life for certain drug delivery pumps placed with customers.
 
Capital expenditures were $131.1 million for the first half of 2005, compared to $108.3 million for the first half of 2004. The increase is driven by spending related to building the company's independent infrastructure, capacity expansion and ongoing projects.
Updated 2005 Projections
 
Hospira increased its projection for annual net sales for the fiscal year 2005 to approximately $2.6 billion. The company also increased its diluted earnings per share projection to a range of $1.47 to $1.52, including estimated non-recurring transition expenses described below and the charges related to the transaction with ICU Medical.
 
Adjusted* diluted earnings per share for 2005, which exclude the non-recurring transition expenses and the charges related to the ICU Medical transaction, are projected to be in the range of $1.77 to $1.82.
 
The reconciliation between the projected adjusted* diluted earnings per share and earnings per share on a GAAP basis is:
 
GAAP and adjusted* basis do not include the effect of any future decision to repatriate foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the expensing of stock options. The company expects to implement the accounting standard related to stock option expensing on Jan. 1, 2006.
The earnings per share projection on both a
 
Additional information on selected income statement items is outlined in the table below.
 
In addition, the company projects that cash flow from operations will be in the $425 million to $475 million range in 2005. Depreciation and amortization for 2005 is projected to be in the $160 million to $170 million range. Capital expenditures for 2005 are projected to be in the $250 million to $275 million range.
 
*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP in the United States included within this press release, Hospira has provided certain information that is considered non-GAAP financial measures. As used in this press release, "adjusted" refers to operating performance measures that exclude the non-recurring transition expenses related to becoming an independent, stand-alone company, charges related to the ICU Medical transaction in 2005 and the one-time curtailment gain reported in the year-to-date results for 2004.
 
The adjusted information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Rules and is included in the attached supplemental data.
 
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and its investors in their analysis of the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Management also uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Hospira may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
In the second quarter of 2005, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $10.2 million ($7.7 million, or $0.05 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. The company has previously stated that these non-recurring transition expenses are expected to total approximately $100 million over the 24-month period ending April 30, 2006. Of these costs, a total of $53.3 million has been incurred through June 30, 2005. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2005 Hospira incurred a $13.4 million ($10.2 million, or $0.06 per share, after tax) charge for obligations related to the sale of the Salt Lake City manufacturing facility.
