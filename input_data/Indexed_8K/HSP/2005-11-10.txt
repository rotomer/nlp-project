LAKE FOREST, Ill., Nov. 10, 2005  Hospira, Inc. (NYSE:HSP), one of the largest hospital products manufacturers in the United States, today reported results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2005.

Net sales were $656.6 million, 0.1 percent above the third quarter of 2004. Adjusted* net income increased 14.0 percent to $78.0 million, compared to $68.5 million in the third quarter of 2004. Adjusted* diluted earnings per share were $0.48 versus $0.44 in the prior year's third quarter.
 
GAAP (U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income was $59.9 million, compared to $61.3 million in the same quarter of 2004. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.37 versus $0.39 in the prior year's third quarter.
 
Certain results in this press release are discussed on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. A description of the adjusted financial information is provided in the section "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained in this press release. A reconciliation of the adjusted financial information to the most comparable GAAP measure is contained in the schedules attached to the press release.
 
"We had an extremely positive third quarter as we continued our strong performance in the marketplace and made progress on our transition activities," said Christopher B. Begley, chief executive officer, Hospira. "Robust growth in our higher-margin products within Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals and Medication Delivery Systems was an important driver of our results."

Financial and Operating Review
 
Consolidated net sales in the quarter increased 0.1 percent to $656.6 million, compared to $656.1 million in the third quarter of 2004. A schedule detailing sales by product line for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2005 and 2004 is attached to this press release.
 
In the third quarter of 2005, compared to the same quarter of 2004, the components of consolidated net sales growth were as follows:
 
 - 
                 
Volume and mix (excluding Berlex and the impact of sales-type lease accounting for certain pumps)  4.5 percentage points,
 - 
                 
Favorable pricing  1.9 percentage points,
 - 
                 
Impact of sales-type lease accounting for certain pumps  1.1 percentage points, and
 - 
                 
Foreign currency translation  0.5 percentage points.
 
Offsetting these components of growth was the negative effect of 7.9 percentage points related to the termination of the agreement to distribute Berlex imaging agents.
 
Gross profit in the quarter was $227.6 million, an increase of 17.4 percent from $193.8 million in the same period last year. Gross margin in the quarter was 34.7 percent, compared to 29.5 percent in the prior year's third quarter. Adjusted* gross profit grew 19.2 percent to $232.6 million, compared to $195.1 million in the same quarter of 2004. The adjusted* gross margin for the 2005 third quarter improved to 35.4 percent, from 29.7 percent last year. The adjusted* gross margin improvement was primarily attributable to:
 
 - 
                 
Improved volume and mix  3.9 percentage points, of which 2.0 percentage points represented the impact of the termination of the Berlex agreement, and
 - 
                 
Favorable pricing on sales  1.2 percentage points.
 
Research and development (R&D) expense rose 26.9 percent in the quarter to $35.5 million, or 5.4 percent of sales, compared to $28.0 million, or 4.3 percent of sales, in the third quarter of 2004. The company continues to increase its investment in R&D as part of its stated strategy to build its product pipeline to drive longer-term sales growth.
 
Selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expense in the quarter was $91.5 million, compared to $71.9 million in the 2004 third quarter. As a percentage of sales, S,G&A was 13.9 percent in the quarter, compared to 11.0 percent in 2004. Adjusted* S,G&A expense in the quarter was $84.3 million, or 12.8 percent of sales, compared to $63.6 million in the third quarter of 2004, or 9.7 percent of sales. As expected, the increase in the adjusted* S,G&A primarily was driven by higher ongoing, incremental costs associated with being an independent, public company.
 
Income from operations in the quarter was $100.6 million, compared to $93.9 million in the third quarter of 2004. The operating margin for the quarter was 15.3 percent, compared to 14.3 percent for the same period in 2004. Adjusted* income from operations in the quarter was $113.0 million, an increase of 8.9 percent from $103.7 million in the third quarter of 2004. The adjusted* operating margin for the quarter was 17.2 percent, compared to 15.8 percent in 2004. The increase was attributable to the improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher R&D and S,G&A spending.
 
Interest expense in the quarter was $6.9 million, compared to $8.3 million in the same period of 2004. The decline was due to an interest rate swap entered into in 2005 and higher capitalized interest in the current quarter.
 
Other income was $3.4 million in the quarter, compared to other income of $2.5 million for 2004. The majority of the change is due to higher interest income in 2005.
 
Net income in the quarter was $59.9 million, compared to $61.3 million in the third quarter of 2004. Adjusted* net income for the quarter increased 14.0 percent to $78.0 million, from $68.5 million in 2004.  The tax rate for the quarter, excluding the tax charge of $9.5 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act of 2004, was 28.7 percent, compared to 30.1 percent in 2004. The company is now projecting the full-year tax rate to be 25.5 percent. This is an increase from the previously projected rate of 24.0 percent, as a greater proportion of income is now anticipated to be sourced from the United States rather than from lower-tax-rate non-U.S. jurisdictions. As a result, the 2005 third-quarter tax rate reflects the adjustment necessary to provide for income taxes at a 25.5 percent rate through the first nine months of 2005, excluding the impact of the repatriation.
 
Nine-Month Results
 
Results for the nine months of 2005 reflect the company's status as an independent public company. The nine months of 2004 reflect results for the business operated as a part of Abbott for the months of January through April, and as a stand-alone business for the subsequent five months.
 
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2005, consolidated net sales increased 1.8 percent to $1.98 billion, compared to $1.94 billion in the same period of 2004. Net sales were favorably affected by foreign currency translation of $11.0 million. Excluding the benefit from foreign currency translation, net sales increased 1.3 percent.
 
Net income was $209.1 million, compared to $252.1 million in the first nine months of 2004. Diluted earnings per share were $1.30, compared to $1.61 last year. Adjusted* net income was $255.2 million, compared to $222.7 million last year. Adjusted* diluted earnings per share in the first nine months of 2005 were $1.59, compared to $1.42 in the prior year.
 
Cash Flow Items
 
Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of 2005 was $471.3 million, compared to $285.9 million in last year's same period.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $118.0 million for the first nine months, compared to $103.1 million for the same period in 2004. The increase is due to higher levels of capital spending and increased depreciation related to the change in the fourth quarter of 2004 in the estimated useful life for certain drug delivery pumps placed with customers.
 
Capital expenditures were $189.5 million for the first nine months of 2005, compared to $168.7 million for 2004. The increase is driven by spending related to building the company's independent infrastructure, capacity expansion and ongoing projects.
 
Updated 2005 Projections
 
Hospira's projection for annual net sales for the 2005 year remains approximately $2.6 billion. The company increased its diluted earnings per share projection to a range of $1.53 to $1.58, including the items listed below.
 
Adjusted* diluted earnings per share for 2005, which exclude the items listed below, are projected to be in the range of $1.90 to $1.95.
 
The reconciliation between the projected adjusted* diluted earnings per share and earnings per share on a GAAP basis is:
 
 
The earnings per share projections on both a GAAP and adjusted* basis do not include the effect of any expensing of stock options. The company expects to implement the accounting standard related to stock option expensing on Jan. 1, 2006.
 
In addition, the company now projects that cash flow from operations will be in the $550 million to $600 million range in 2005. Depreciation and amortization for 2005 is projected to be in the $155 million to $165 million range. Capital expenditures for 2005 are projected to be in the $250 million to $275 million range.
 
*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP in the United States included within this press release, Hospira has provided certain information that is considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. As used in this press release, "adjusted" refers to operating performance measures that exclude the non-recurring transition expenses in 2005 and 2004 related to becoming an independent, stand-alone company; charges related to the ICU Medical transaction, charges related to the planned closing of the Donegal, Ireland, facility, and the tax impact of the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, and a one-time curtailment gain in 2004.
 
The adjusted information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Rules and is included in the attached supplemental data.
 
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and its investors in their analysis of the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Management also uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Hospira may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
In the third quarter of 2005, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $10.1 million ($7.5 million, or $0.04 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. The company has previously stated that these non-recurring transition expenses are expected to total approximately $100 million over the 24-month period ending April 30, 2006. Of these costs, a total of $63.4 million has been incurred through Sept. 30, 2005. Also included in the third quarter 2005 GAAP diluted earnings per share are $0.01 per share for charges related to the previously announced planned closing of the Donegal, Ireland, manufacturing plant, and $0.06 per share related to the company's decision to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings of $175.0 million under the Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
 
Included in the third quarter 2004 GAAP diluted earnings per share are non-recurring transition expenses of $0.05 per share related to building the company's independent infrastructure.
