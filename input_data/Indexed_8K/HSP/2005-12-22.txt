Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On December 16, 2005, Hospira entered into a new $375,000,000 revolving credit agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, with the lenders identified on such exhibit.  Exhibit 10.1 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.  The new revolving credit agreement replaces the old amended revolving credit agreement, dated April 29, 2005, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to Hospira's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2005, filed with the SEC on May 12, 2005.  Hospira did not incur any penalties in connection with the termination of the old revolving credit agreement.  Except as described below, the new revolving credit agreement is substantially similar to Hospira's old revolving credit agreement.
 
The new revolving credit agreement is for a five-year term, expiring December 16, 2010. The term may be extended for two additional years under certain circumstances.  Hospira may borrow up to $375 million under the new revolving credit agreement for working capital and other purposes.  The aggregate amount of revolving loan commitments may be increased to $500 million under certain circumstances.   If there are any borrowings by Hospira subsidiaries, those borrowings will be guaranteed by the parent company.
 
The new revolving credit agreement provides for more favorable pricing than Hospira's old revolving credit facility.  The applicable margin on LIBOR-based loans, the facility fee and the utilization fee are based upon Hospira's credit rating.  Based on Hospira's current senior debt rating of BBB from Standard & Poors, the old and new pricing terms follow:
 
 
(1) The facility fee is paid on the aggregate revolving loan commitments, regardless of actual borrowings.
 
(2) The applicable margin is added to the LIBOR rate for purposes of calculating the interest rate on LIBOR-based loans.
 
(3) The utilization fee becomes payable once Hospira borrows more than 50% of the aggregate committed loans under the Revolver.  Under the old revolving credit agreement, the utilization fee was payable once Hospira borrowed more than 33% of the aggregate committed loans.
 
Under the new revolving credit agreement, Hospira must comply with financial covenants, including maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least 5:1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.25:1.  The maximum leverage ratio was 3.0:1 under the old revolving credit agreement.  "Interest coverage ratio" and "leverage ratio" are defined in the new revolving credit agreement.   There is no longer a requirement that Hospira maintain a specified tangible net worth.   The revolver contains other customary representations, warranties and covenants, including restrictions on Hospira's ability to merge or consolidate with other entities.  The new revolving credit agreement also contains customary events of default, upon which any borrowings could be accelerated.
 
Hospira had no borrowings under its old revolving credit agreement, and has no borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement.

Without limiting the foregoing and in furtherance thereof, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not give rise to any liability on the part of the Issuing Bank to the Borrower.

Non-US Lender
each other Lender), and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Credit Parties or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (x) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor forms), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code or reasonably requested by the Credit Parties to establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable under any of the Loan Documents.
 
Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters pursuant to Section 2.8B(iii)(a) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial delivery by such Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Lender shall promptly (1) deliver to Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower two new original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or a Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two (2) original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form), as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Credit Parties to confirm or establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents or (2) notify Administrative Agent and the Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence.

(c)
          
provided
 
If a payment is made by a Credit Party under the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8(B) for the account of any Lender and such Lender, in its sole opinion, determines that it has irrevocably received or been granted a credit against, or relief or remission from, or repayment or refund of, any tax paid or payable by it in respect of or calculated with reference to the deduction or withholding giving rise to such additional payment, such Lender shall, to the extent that it determines that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to such Credit Party such amount as such Lender shall, in its sole opinion, have determined is attributable to such deduction or withholding and will leave such Lender (after such payment) in no worse position than it would have been had such Credit Party not been required to make such deduction or withholding.
(iv)
         
Nothing contained herein shall (i) interfere with the right of a Lender to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit, (ii) oblige any Lender to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or (iii) require any Lender to take or refrain from taking any action that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other credit, relief, remission, repayment or refund to which it may be entitled.

Without limiting the Lenders' obligations under the preceding sentence, each Lender agrees that it will, without material cost or other material disadvantage (as determined in such Lender's good faith judgment), cooperate with such Subsidiary Borrower to minimize the applicable withholding tax burdens in the Relevant Jurisdiction.  If any Lender becomes subject to any Tax because it fails to comply with this Section 2.8B(v), each Subsidiary Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Tax.  The Administrative Agent agrees that it will provide administrative and ministerial assistance to each relevant Subsidiary Borrower with respect to any payments made by such Subsidiary Borrower to the Lenders, and the calculation, reporting, withholding and remitting of any Taxes imposed by Canada or Ireland to the appropriate Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Subsidiary Borrowers shall retain primary responsibility for ascertaining the requirements of Applicable Law and providing to the Lenders the written notice described in the first sentence of this Section 2.8B(v), and (b) no failure by the Administrative Agent to meet any obligations under this Section 2.8B(v) shall operate to excuse any Subsidiary Borrower from its obligations to the Lenders under this Section 2.8B(v).

Special Provisions Governing LIBOR Rate Loans
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the following provisions shall govern with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans as to the matters covered:
 
  In the event that the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Borrowing of LIBOR Rate Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank LIBOR market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by facsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Credit Parties and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted to, LIBOR Rate Loans until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Credit Parties and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, and (ii) any Notice of Borrowing or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by any Credit Party with respect to the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be rescinded by such Credit Party.
A.
Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate.
           
 
  In the event that on any date any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but shall be made only after consultation with Credit Parties and the Administrative Agent) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its LIBOR Rate Loans in Dollars or any Alternative Currency (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful) or (ii) has become impracticable, or would cause such Lender material hardship, as a result of contingencies occurring after the date of this Agreement which materially and adversely affect the interbank LIBOR market or the position of such Lender in that market, then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an "" and it shall on that day give notice (by facsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Credit Parties and the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender).  Thereafter (a) (i) if such LIBOR Rate Loan is denominated in Dollars, it shall be Converted into a Base Rate Loan and (ii) if such LIBOR Rate Loan is denominated in any Alternative Currency, it shall be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Loan and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate

  The Credit Parties shall compensate each Lender upon written request by such Lender (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts and a calculation thereof in reasonable detail) for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid by such Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its LIBOR Rate Loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by such Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds, but excluding lost profits) which that Lender may sustain:  (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a LIBOR Rate Loan is not made on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a telephonic request for borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation of any LIBOR Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Conversion/Continuation Notice or a telephonic request for conversion or continuation, (ii) if any prepayment or other principal payment of, or any conversion of, any of its LIBOR Rate Loans occurs on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan or (iii) if any prepayment of any LIBOR Rate Loan made by such Lender is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower.

Compliance with all current or reasonably foreseeable future requirements pursuant to or under Environmental Laws could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to give rise to a Material Adverse Effect.

Liability of Guarantor Absolute

the Administrative Agent may enforce this Guaranty upon the occurrence of an Event of Default notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between any Credit Party and any Beneficiary with respect to the existence of such Event of Default;

the Obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are independent of the Obligations of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Borrowers and the obligations of any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor), and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower or any of such other guarantors and whether or not the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower is joined in any such action or actions;

(d)
          
 
any Beneficiary, upon such terms as it deems appropriate, without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability hereof or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of the Guarantor's liability hereunder, from time to time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations and take and hold security for the payment hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) release, surrender, exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other obligation of any Person with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of such Beneficiary in respect hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that such Beneficiary may have against any such security, in each case as such Beneficiary in its discretion may determine consistent herewith and any applicable security agreement, including foreclosure on any such security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable, and even though such action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantor against any Subsidiary Borrower or any security for the Guaranteed Obligations; and (vi) exercise any other rights available to it under the Loan Documents; and

Guarantor's Rights of Subrogation, Contribution, etc

The Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from the other Credit Parties on a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of the other Credit Parties and their ability to perform their Obligations under the Loan Documents, and the Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of the other Credit Parties and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of any Beneficiary to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of any other Credit Parties now known or hereafter known by any Beneficiary.

Bankruptcy, etc
 
So long as any Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding, the Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent acting pursuant to the instructions of the Requisite Lenders, commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency case or proceeding of or against any other Credit Party.  The Obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any case or proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or
(a)
          
arrangement of any Credit Party or by any defense which such Credit Party or any other Credit Party may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.
 
The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which accrues after the commencement of any case or proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of such case or proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Guaranteed Obligations if such case or proceeding had not been commenced) shall be included in the Guaranteed Obligations because it is the intention of the Guarantor and the Beneficiaries that the Guaranteed Obligations which are guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant hereto should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve any other Credit Party of any portion of such Guaranteed Obligations.  The Guarantor will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay the Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of the Administrative Agent in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such case or proceeding is commenced.
(b)
          
 
In the event that all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid by any Credit Party, the Obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from any Beneficiary as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guaranteed Obligations for all purposes hereunder.

Usury Savings Clause
 
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged with respect to any of the Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.  As used herein, "" means the maximum lawful interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, charged, or received under the laws applicable to any Lender which are presently in effect or, to the extent allowed by law, under such applicable laws which may hereafter be in effect and which allow a higher maximum nonusurious interest rate than applicable laws now allow.  If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect.  In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Credit Parties shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the Lenders and the Credit Parties to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the Credit Parties.

The Administrative Agent shall, using all amounts obtained or received from the applicable Credit Party pursuant to any such tender or recovery in payment of principal of and interest on the Obligations, promptly purchase the applicable Currency at the most favorable spot exchange rate determined by the Administrative Agent to be available to it.  The obligation of the Credit Parties to make payments in the applicable Currency shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional
 
 
cause of action solely for the purpose of recovering in the applicable Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the currency expressed to be payable pursuant to the applicable Loan Document.
