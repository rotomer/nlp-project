"We completed our first full year as a public company with strong operating results," said Christopher B. Begley, chief executive officer, Hospira. "Our core net sales* grew 5 percent in 2005  better than our expectations  and we made substantial progress in what was a critical year of transition for us, thanks to the hard work and commitment of our employees. Looking forward for 2006, we are building on the momentum we generated in 2005, and expect to see the investments in our new product development begin to pay off.

Certain results in this press release are discussed on both a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. A description of the adjusted financial information is provided in the section "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained in this press release. A reconciliation of the adjusted financial information to the most comparable GAAP measure is contained in the schedules attached to the press release.
 
Financial and Operating Review
 
Consolidated net sales in the quarter decreased 7.7 percent to $646.2 million, compared to $700.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. A schedule detailing sales by product line for the fourth quarters and the full years of 2005 and 2004 is attached to this press release.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to the same quarter of 2004, the components of change in consolidated net sales were as follows:
 
 - 
     
Termination of the Berlex agreement to distribute its imaging agents  unfavorable (7.5) percentage points,
 - 
     
Unfavorable impact of 2004 pump lease adjustment relating to prior periods  (2.0) percentage points,
 - 
     
Foreign currency translation  unfavorable (0.2) percentage point,
 - 
     
Improved volume and mix (excluding Berlex and the pump lease adjustment noted above)  0.7 percentage point, and
 - 
     
Favorable pricing  1.3 percentage points.
Gross profit in the quarter was $185.3 million, a decrease of 13.3 percent from $213.8 million in the same period last year. Gross margin in the quarter was 28.7 percent, compared to 30.5 percent in the prior year's fourth quarter. Adjusted* gross profit declined 2.7 percent to $210.6 million, compared to $216.3 million in the same quarter of 2004. The adjusted* gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2005 improved to 32.6 percent from 30.9 percent last year.
 
The adjusted* gross margin improvement was primarily attributable to:
 
 - 
     
Improved volume and mix  3.7 percentage points, of which 1.8 percentage points represented the impact of the termination of the Berlex agreement,
 - 
     
Favorable pricing  0.9 percentage point,
 - 
     
Higher commodity costs  (1.0) percentage point,
 - 
     
Favorability in 2004 related to a lower rate of returned goods versus historical experience  (1.0) percentage point, and
 - 
     
Higher freight and distribution costs  (0.9) percentage point.
 
Research and development (R&D) expense rose 7.7 percent in the quarter to $42.1 million, or 6.5 percent of sales, compared to $39.0 million, or 5.6 percent of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2004. The company continues to increase its investment in R&D as part of its stated strategy to build its product pipeline to drive longer-term sales growth.
Selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expense in the quarter was $112.8 million, compared to $107.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. As a percentage of sales, S,G&A was 17.5 percent in the quarter, compared to 15.4 percent in 2004. Adjusted* S,G&A expense in the quarter was $103.9 million, or 16.1 percent of sales, compared to $92.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, or 13.2 percent of sales. The increase in the adjusted* S,G&A primarily was driven by higher ongoing, incremental costs associated with being an independent, public company.
 
Income from operations in the quarter was $30.4 million, compared to $67.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The operating margin for the quarter was 4.7 percent, compared to 9.6 percent for the same period in 2004. Adjusted* income from operations in the quarter was $65.1 million, a decrease of 23.1 percent from $84.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The adjusted* operating margin for the quarter was 10.1 percent, compared to 12.1 percent in 2004. The decrease was attributable to the higher R&D and S,G&A spending, which more than offset the improvement in gross margin.
 
Interest expense in the quarter was $7.3 million, compared to $7.8 million in the same period of 2004. The decline was primarily due to higher capitalized interest in the current quarter.
 
Other income was $5.7 million in the quarter, compared to other income of $1.5 million for 2004. The majority of the change is due to higher interest income.
Net income in the quarter was $26.6 million, compared to $49.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Adjusted* net income for the quarter decreased 15.2 percent to $53.4 million, from $62.9 million in 2004. The tax rate for the quarter was 7.4 percent, compared to 18.6 percent in 2004. The company's tax rate for the full year, excluding taxes of $9.1 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act of 2004, was 24.0 percent. This full-year rate was a decrease from the previously projected annual rate of 25.5 percent, primarily due to two factors: the proportionately greater-than-projected mix of income from lower-tax-rate jurisdictions, which was partially driven by the previously announced impairment charges, and a reduction in state tax expense due to certain state tax credits earned. As a result, the 2005 fourth-quarter tax rate reflects the adjustment necessary to provide for income taxes at the 24.0 percent rate for the full year, excluding the impact of the repatriation.
 
Full-Year 2005 Results
 
Results for the full year of 2005 reflect the company's status as an independent public company. The 12 months of 2004 reflect results for the business operated as a part of Abbott Laboratories for the months of January through April, and as a stand-alone business for the subsequent eight months.
 
Consolidated net sales for 2005 were $2.63 billion compared to $2.65 billion in 2004, a decrease of 0.7 percent. Net sales for the year were favorably affected by foreign currency translation of $9.3 million. Excluding the benefit from foreign currency translation, net sales declined 1.0 percent over 2004.
Net income was $235.6 million, compared to $301.6 million in 2004. Diluted earnings per share were $1.46, compared to $1.92 last year. Adjusted* net income was $308.5 million, compared to $285.6 million last year. Adjusted* diluted earnings per share in 2005 were $1.91, compared to $1.82 in the prior year.
 
Cash Flow Items
 
Cash flow from operations for 2005 was $571.1 million, compared to $387.0 million in 2004.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $156.3 million for 2005, compared to $145.5 million in 2004. The increase is due to higher levels of capital spending.
 
Capital expenditures were $256.1 million for 2005, compared to $228.9 million for 2004. The increase is driven by spending related to building the company's independent infrastructure, capacity expansion and ongoing projects.
 
Projections for 2006
 
Hospira projects that annual net sales growth for the 2006 year will be in the 4 to 6 percent range.
Adjusted* diluted earnings per share for 2006, which exclude the items listed below, are projected to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.10. The adjusted* operating margin is estimated to be in the 17.0 to 17.5 percent range, excluding options expense.
 
The reconciliation between the projected adjusted* diluted earnings per share and earnings per share on a GAAP basis is:
 
In addition, the company projects that cash flow from operations in 2006 will be in the $520 million to $570 million range. Depreciation and amortization is projected to range between $150 million to $160 million. Capital expenditures are projected to be in the $230 million to $260 million range.
 
*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP in the United States included within this press release, Hospira has provided certain information that is considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. As used in this press release, "adjusted" refers to operating performance measures that exclude the non-recurring transition expenses in 2005 and 2004 related to becoming an independent, stand-alone company; charges related to the company's manufacturing optimization initiatives, which in 2005 included the sale of the Salt Lake City facility to ICU Medical, Inc. and the planned closing of the Donegal, Ireland facility; impairment charges in 2005 related to the Montreal, Canada and Ashland, Ohio facilities; the tax impact of the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005; and a curtailment gain in 2004.
 
"Core net sales," as used in this press release, refer to Hospira's consolidated net sales excluding U.S. and international sales to Abbott, sales of Berlex imaging agents under the arrangement that terminated during the second quarter of 2005, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Management believes that core net sales provide investors an additional measure to assess the underlying sales trend of Hospira's ongoing business.
Management believes that the charges, gains and sales which are excluded in the manner described above are not necessarily indicative of the company's base business results. Therefore, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when presented together with, and reconciled to, the comparable measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Management believes that such presentation enables investors to have more complete information with which to assess the company's base results of operation and prospects. Such presentation also facilitates period-to-period comparison of Hospira's base operating results. In addition, management uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Hospira may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2005, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $15.0 million ($11.4 million, or $0.07 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. Also included in the fourth quarter 2005 GAAP diluted earnings per share are $0.09 per share for charges related to the planned closing of the Donegal, Ireland facility and impairment charges related to the Montreal, Canada and Ashland, Ohio facilities.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $17.6 million ($13.4 million, or $0.09 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure.
 
For the full year of 2005, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $46.0 million ($35.0 million, or $0.21 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. The company has previously stated that these non-recurring transition expenses are expected to total approximately $100 million over the 24-month period ending April 30, 2006. Of these costs, a total of $78.4 million has been incurred through Dec. 31, 2005. Also included in the full-year 2005 GAAP diluted earnings per share are $0.18 per share for charges associated with the impairment related to the Montreal, Canada and Ashland, Ohio facilities and the company's manufacturing optimization initiatives, which for 2005 included the planned closing of the company's Donegal, Ireland facility and the sale of the Salt Lake City manufacturing facility; and $0.06 per share related to the company's decision to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings of $175.0 million under the Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
 
For the 2004 full year, the non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses were $32.4 million ($24.4 million, or $0.16 per share, after tax). The 2004 results also include the one-time, non-cash curtailment gain of $64.6 million ($40.4 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) recorded in the second quarter of 2004.
