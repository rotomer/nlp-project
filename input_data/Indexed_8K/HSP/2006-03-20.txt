Item 5.02  Departure of Directors
 
(b)  On March 14, 2006, Hospira's directors, Judith C. Pelham and William L. Weiss, resigned from Hospira's board of directors with such resignations to take effect at the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders. Each director will continue to serve on the board through the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders. Neither director resigned as a result of any disagreement with Hospira on any matter.

Hospira's board of directors has nominated successors to their board seats to be elected by the shareholders at the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders. Such nominees will be identified in Hospira's proxy statement relating to the meeting.
 
The 2006 annual meeting of shareholders is expected to be held on May 17, 2006, and proxy materials are expected to be mailed to shareholders beginning on March 31, 2006.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
