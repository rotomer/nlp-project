Exhibit 99.1
HOSPIRA REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER 2006 RESULTS
  Increases Earnings Projections for 2006 
Net sales were $664.3 million, 0.3 percent above first-quarter 2005 results. Core net sales*, which exclude sales of Berlex imaging agents, sales to Abbott and the impact of foreign exchange, grew 10.5 percent.
                 
Adjusted* first-quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share were $0.62, including, for the first time, the impact of stock option expense, compared to $0.55 in 2005. Had the company recorded the pro-forma stock option expense of $0.02 during the 2005 first quarter, adjusted* earnings per share would have increased 17.0 percent year over year.
                 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.49 in the first quarters of both 2006 and 2005. The 2006 diluted earnings per share included stock option expense.
                 
LAKE FOREST, Ill., May 9, 2006  Hospira, Inc. (NYSE:HSP), a leading global hospital products company, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006.
"Hospira began the year on very strong footing," said Christopher B. Begley, chief executive officer, Hospira. "We continued to drive growth, increasing our core net sales* by more than 10 percent. In addition to launching several new products, we made significant progress toward completing the two-year transition related to our spin-off as an independent public company. It was an excellent quarter for the company and a great start to 2006, thanks to the continued effort and dedication of our employees."
Certain results in this press release are discussed on both a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. Adjusted* measures exclude certain items more fully described in the section "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained in this press release. A reconciliation of the adjusted financial information to the most comparable GAAP measure is contained in the schedules attached to the press release.
Hospira's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS No. 123R) on Jan. 1, 2006, resulted in the recognition of stock option expense for the first time in the income statement for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, which adversely affects comparisons to the 2005 period.

Significant Events for the First Quarter
Introduced the LifeCare PCA infusion system. The next-generation patient-controlled analgesia pump features wireless Hospira MedNet capability, further extending the number of pump platforms for which Hospira MedNet is available.

Announced a marketing and distribution alliance between Hospira and Taiyo Yakuhin, the leading generic pharmaceuticals manufacturer in Japan, the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market.
                 
Announced plans to close manufacturing plants in Ashland, Ohio, and Montreal, Canada, as part of the company's manufacturing optimization initiatives, relocating most of the production to other Hospira facilities or third-party sources. Also provided the timeline for relocating production from the North Chicago, Ill., facility leased from Abbott.
                 
Announced a $400 million share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2006, the company had repurchased a total of 5.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $224.8 million.
                 
Announced the nominations for election to Hospira's board of directors of Ronald A. Matricaria and Mark F. Wheeler, and the planned resignations of Judith C. Pelham and William L. Weiss from the board, effective May 17, 2006, the date of Hospira's annual meeting of shareholders.
                 
Progressed with the separation from Abbott, transitioning 13 additional countries to Hospira, continuing the build-out of Hospira's independent information technology infrastructure, and completing the move of employees into the company's new research and development (R&D) facility. In addition, launched the Asia-Pacific regional headquarters in Osaka, Japan, completing the launch of all four of Hospira's regional hubs.

Financial and Operating Review
Consolidated net sales in the quarter increased 0.3 percent to $664.3 million, compared to $662.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. A schedule detailing sales by product line for the first quarters of 2006 and 2005 is attached to this press release.
In the first quarter of 2006, compared to the same quarter of 2005, the components of change in consolidated net sales were as follows:
                 
Improved volume and mix (excluding the sales of Berlex imaging agents)  favorable 7.3 percentage points,
                 
Favorable pricing  0.8 percentage point,
                 
Foreign currency translation  unfavorable (0.2) percentage point, and
                 
Termination of the Berlex agreement to distribute its imaging agents  unfavorable (7.6) percentage points.
Gross profit in the quarter was $244.8 million, an increase of 12.4 percent from $217.8 million in the same period last year. Gross margin in the quarter was 36.9 percent, compared to 32.9 percent in the prior year's first quarter. Adjusted* gross profit grew 18.5 percent to $261.8 million, compared to $220.9 million in the same quarter of 2005. The adjusted* gross margin for the first quarter improved to 39.4 percent from 33.4 percent last year.
4
The improvement to adjusted* gross margin was primarily attributable to:
                 
Improved volume and mix  4.6 percentage points, of which 2.2 percentage points represented the impact of the termination of the Berlex agreement,
                 
Favorable manufacturing performance  1.5 percentage points,
                 
Favorable pricing  0.5 percentage point, and
                 
Higher international freight and distribution costs  unfavorable (0.8) percentage point.
R&D expense rose 9.2 percent in the quarter to $31.0 million, or 4.7 percent of sales, compared to $28.4 million, or 4.3 percent of sales, in the first quarter of 2005. Adjusted* R&D expense in the quarter was $29.1 million, or 4.4 percent of sales, compared to $28.3 million, or 4.3 percent of sales, for the same period last year. The increase in adjusted* R&D expense was primarily due to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.
5
Selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expense in the quarter was $101.8 million, or 15.3 percent of sales, compared to $81.9 million, or 12.4 percent of sales in the first quarter of 2005. Adjusted* S,G&A expense in the quarter was $91.2 million, or 13.7 percent of sales, compared to $72.0 million for the same period last year, or 10.9 percent of sales. The increase in the adjusted* S,G&A was primarily driven by inflation and higher ongoing, incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public company, particularly in relation to establishing the company's own information technology system and independent international operations. The inclusion of stock option expense in the first quarter of 2006 was also a factor in the higher adjusted* S,G&A expense.
Income from operations in the quarter was $112.0 million, compared to $107.5 million in the first quarter of 2005. The operating margin for the quarter was 16.9 percent, compared to 16.2 percent for the same period in 2005. Adjusted* income from operations in the quarter was $141.6 million, an increase of 17.3 percent from $120.7 million in the first quarter of 2005. The adjusted* operating margin for the quarter was 21.3 percent, compared to 18.2 percent in the same period of 2005. The increase was attributable to the improvement in gross margin, which more than offset higher S,G&A expense.
Interest expense in the quarter was $7.7 million, compared to $7.2 million in the same period of 2005. Other income was $4.7 million in the quarter, compared to other income of $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2005. The majority of the change is due to higher interest income.
6
Net income in the quarter was $80.2 million, compared to $77.2 million in the first quarter of 2005. Adjusted* net income for the quarter increased 16.9 percent to $101.9 million, from $87.2 million in 2005. The tax rate for the quarter was 26.5 percent, compared to 24.0 percent in 2005. The tax rate increase is primarily due to increased income generated in the United States, which has higher tax rates than foreign jurisdictions.
Cash Flow Items
Cash flow from operations for the first quarter of 2006 was $130.5 million, compared to $90.4 million in the same quarter of 2005.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $37.6 million, compared to $40.6 million in the first quarter of 2005. The decrease primarily reflects a lower balance of infusion pumps on Hospira's balance sheet.
Capital expenditures were $76.0 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared to $50.1 million for the same period in 2005. The increase was driven by spending related to building the company's independent infrastructure and to manufacturing-related projects.
7
2006 Projections
Hospira continues to project that annual net sales growth for the 2006 year will be in the 4 to 6 percent range.
The company has increased its adjusted* diluted earnings per share and adjusted* operating margin projections for 2006 from the initial projections provided in February 2006. In addition, with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, these estimates now reflect the inclusion of the previously projected stock option expense for 2006.
Adjusted* diluted earnings per share for 2006, which exclude the items listed below, are projected to be in the range of $1.97 to $2.02, including stock option expense of $0.15 a share. The adjusted* operating margin is estimated to be in the 16.3 to 16.8 percent range, including pre-tax stock option expense of approximately $33 million.
8
The reconciliation between the projected adjusted* diluted earnings per share and earnings per share on a GAAP basis is:
 
In addition, the company continues to project that cash flow from operations in 2006 will be in the $520 million to $570 million range. Depreciation and amortization is projected to range between $150 million to $160 million. Capital expenditures are projected to be in the $230 million to $260 million range.

*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP included within this press release, Hospira has provided certain information that is considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.
As used in this press release, "adjusted" refers to operating performance measures that exclude the non-recurring transition expenses in 2006 and 2005 related to becoming an independent, stand-alone company and charges related to the company's manufacturing optimization initiatives. In addition, the company is providing adjusted* earnings per share including pro-forma stock option expense for the first quarter of 2005 to facilitate year-over-year comparability, given the company's adoption of SFAS No. 123R on Jan. 1, 2006.
"Core net sales," as used in this press release, refer to Hospira's consolidated net sales excluding U.S. and international sales to Abbott related to transition arrangements made at the time of the spin-off, sales of Berlex imaging agents under the arrangement that terminated during the second quarter of 2005, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Management believes that core net sales provide investors an additional measure to assess the underlying sales trend of Hospira's ongoing business.
10
Management believes that the charges and sales excluded in the manner described above are not necessarily indicative of the company's base business results. Therefore, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when presented together with and reconciled to the comparable measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Management believes that such presentation enables investors to have more complete information with which to assess the company's results of operations and prospects. Such presentation also facilitates period-to-period comparison of Hospira's operating results. In addition, management uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Hospira may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In the first quarter of 2006, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $13.5 million ($9.9 million, or $0.06 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. The company has previously stated that these non-recurring transitional expenses are expected to total approximately $100 million over the two-year period ending in the second quarter of 2006. A total of $91.9 million of these costs have been incurred through March 31, 2006.
11
Also included in the first-quarter 2006 GAAP diluted earnings per share are $16.1 million ($11.8 million, or $0.07 per share, after tax) for restructuring and other charges related to the company's manufacturing optimization initiatives, which include the planned closing of the Donegal (Ireland), Ashland and Montreal facilities, and the relocation of production from the leased North Chicago facility.
In the first quarter of 2005, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $10.7 million ($8.2 million, or $0.05 per share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. The company also incurred an asset impairment charge of $2.4 million, ($1.8 million, or $0.01 per share, after tax) related to the sale to ICU Medical of the Salt Lake City critical care manufacturing facility and certain equipment and inventory. In addition, as previously indicated, the first-quarter 2005 GAAP results do not include stock option expense.
