Exhibit 99.1
HOSPIRA REPORTS SECOND-QUARTER 2006 RESULTS
 Reaffirms 2006 Adjusted Earnings Per Share Guidance 
Net sales were $671.1 million, 1.4 percent above second-quarter 2005 results. Core net sales*  which exclude sales of Berlex imaging agents, sales to Abbott and the impact of foreign exchange  grew 4.2 percent.
                 
Adjusted* second-quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share were $0.43 compared with $0.53 in 2005. Adjusted* six-month 2006 diluted earnings per share were $1.06 compared with $1.07 for the same period in 2005. The 2006 diluted earnings per share amounts include the impact of stock option expense; the 2005 amounts include pro-forma stock option expense.
                 
GAAP second-quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share were $0.34 compared with $0.44 per share in the second quarter of 2005. GAAP six-month 2006 diluted earnings per share were $0.83 compared with $0.93 per share for the same period in 2005. The 2006 diluted earnings per share amounts include stock option expense of 6 cents for the second quarter and 9 cents for the year-to-date period.

"Hospira had a solid second quarter in our underlying commercial performance," said Christopher B. Begley, chief executive officer, Hospira. "We are pleased with the progress we've made year to date and are on track with our earnings expectations for the first half of 2006. While the timing of expenses this year is different from last year, making quarterly comparisons difficult, we continue to expect this to be a very good year for Hospira and have reaffirmed our 2006 adjusted diluted earnings per share projections."
Certain results in this press release are discussed on both a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. Adjusted* measures exclude certain items more fully described in the section "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained in this press release. A reconciliation of the adjusted financial information to the most comparable GAAP measure is contained in the schedules attached to this press release.
Hospira's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS No. 123R), on Jan. 1, 2006, resulted in the recognition of stock option expense in the 2006 income statements; this adversely affects comparisons to the 2005 period.

Significant Events for the Second Quarter
Launched several new injectable generic products, including propofol, sodium bicarbonate in Hospira's proprietary Ansyr syringe delivery system, and ceftazidime in Hospira's proprietary ADD-Vantage delivery system.
                 
Introduced the VisIV next-generation intravenous (I.V.) container, a product that Hospira believes represents the most significant improvement to the I.V. bag since the switch from glass to plastic in the 1970s, advanced by its heightened safety and environmentally friendly features.
                 
Announced the partnership with InnerWireless, Inc. to enhance connectivity between hospital systems and Hospira's medication management devices. Hospira is the first supplier of infusion devices to offer interoperability with InnerWireless's in-building wireless system.
                 
Effectively completed the legal separation from Abbott, including the transition of the remaining countries to Hospira. Hospira now has its own sales forces in 18 countries and distributor relationships in 38 others.
                 
Announced the promotion of Terrence C. Kearney to the newly created position of chief operating officer. Kearney is also acting as chief financial officer until a successor is appointed.
                 
Announced the election of Ronald A. Matricaria and Mark F. Wheeler, M.D., to Hospira's board of directors at the company's annual meeting of shareholders on May 17, 2006.

Financial and Operating Review
Net sales in the second quarter increased 1.4 percent to $671.1 million, compared with $661.9 million in the second quarter of 2005. Core net sales* grew 4.2 percent. A schedule detailing sales by product line for the second quarters and first six months of 2006 and 2005 is attached to this press release.
The components of the year-over-year improvement to net sales are as follows:
                 
Improved volume and mix (excluding the sales of Berlex imaging agents)  1.9 percentage points,
                 
Favorable pricing in the U.S.  1.6 percentage points,
                 
Favorable foreign currency translation  0.4 percentage point, and
                 
Termination of the Berlex agreement to distribute its imaging agents  unfavorable (2.5) percentage points.
Gross profit in the quarter was $225.1 million, an increase of 3.1 percent from $218.4 million in the same period last year. Gross margin in the quarter was 33.5 percent, compared with 33.0 percent in the prior year's second quarter. Adjusted* gross profit was $233.4 million, compared with $233.6 million in the same quarter of 2005. The adjusted* gross margin for the second quarter was 34.8 percent, compared with 35.3 percent in the second quarter of 2005.
4
 
The change to adjusted* gross margin was primarily attributable to:
                 
Higher freight and distribution costs, primarily in the International segment, due in part to additional costs related to the segment's new business infrastructure and to temporary supply chain disruptions  unfavorable (1.5) percentage points,
                 
Lower manufacturing throughput  unfavorable (0.5) percentage point,
                 
Impact of stock option expense  unfavorable (0.4) percentage point,
                 
Favorable pricing in the U.S.  1.1 percentage points, and
                 
Improved volume and mix  1.3 percentage points, of which 0.8 percentage point represented the impact of the termination of the Berlex agreement.
Research and development (R&D) expense rose 18.9 percent in the quarter to $39.1 million, or 5.8 percent of sales, compared with $32.9 million, or 5.0 percent of sales, in the second quarter of 2005. Adjusted* R&D expense in the quarter was $38.0 million, or 5.7 percent of sales, compared with $32.7 million, or 4.9 percent of sales, for the same period last year. The increase in adjusted* R&D expense was due to new product development and stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.
5
 
Selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expense in the quarter was $111.1 million, or 16.6 percent of sales, compared with $87.4 million, or 13.2 percent of sales in the second quarter of 2005. Adjusted* S,G&A expense in the quarter was $102.5 million, or 15.3 percent of sales, compared with $79.2 million for the same period last year, or 12.0 percent of sales. The increase was partly driven by the inclusion of stock option expense in the second quarter of 2006. Also contributing to the increase were higher ongoing, incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public company, particularly for the company's independent information technology system and for international operations, now fully separated from Abbott.
Income from operations in the quarter was $75.0 million, compared with $98.2 million in the second quarter of 2005. The operating margin for the quarter was 11.2 percent, compared with 14.8 percent for the same period in 2005. Adjusted* income from operations in the quarter was $92.9 million, compared with $121.7 million in the second quarter of 2005. The adjusted* operating margin for the quarter was 13.8 percent, compared with 18.4 percent in the same period of 2005. The decrease was attributable to the higher S,G&A and R&D expense.
Interest expense in the quarter was $7.3 million, compared with $6.9 million in the same period of 2005. Other income, primarily interest income, was $3.5 million in both the 2006 and 2005 quarters.
6
 
Net income in the quarter was $54.2 million, compared with $72.0 million in the second quarter of 2005. Adjusted* net income for the quarter was $67.8 million compared with $89.9 million in 2005.
The tax rate for the quarter was 24.0 percent, the same as in the second quarter of 2005. The company is now projecting the full-year 2006 tax rate to be 25.5 percent, a decrease from the previously estimated rate of 26.5 percent, due primarily to an anticipated higher proportion of income from lower-tax jurisdictions. The second-quarter tax rate reflects the amount required to bring the year-to-date rate to the currently projected 2006 rate of 25.5 percent.
Six-Month Results
Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2006, increased 0.9 percent to $1.34 billion, compared with $1.32 billion in the same period of 2005. Core net sales* grew 7.3 percent.
Net income was $134.3 million, compared with $149.2 million in the first six months of 2005. Diluted earnings per share were $0.83, compared with $0.93 last year. Adjusted* net income was $171.1 million, compared with $177.1 million last year. Adjusted* diluted earnings per share in the first six months of 2006 were $1.06 compared with $1.07 in the prior year, including pro-forma stock option expense.
7
 
Cash Flow Items
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2006 was $179.9 million, compared with $300.2 million in the same period last year, primarily due to year-over-year increases in working capital. The rise in working capital is primarily due to higher inventory, reflecting planned normal inventory builds and additional safety stocks to support the business as manufacturing production transfers occur; and higher receivables resulting from sales growth.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $78.9 million for the first six months of 2006, compared with $80.5 million for the first half of 2005. The decrease reflects a lower balance of infusion pumps on Hospira's balance sheet due to fewer placements under operating leases versus sales-type leases or outright sales.
Capital expenditures were $139.8 million for the first half of 2006, compared with $131.1 million for the same period in 2005. The increase was driven primarily by manufacturing-related projects
.
2006 Projections
Hospira projects that core net sales* will grow 7 to 9 percent. On a GAAP basis, net sales growth is now projected to range between 3 and 5 percent.
8
 
Adjusted* diluted earnings per share for 2006, which exclude the items listed below, are projected to be in the range of $1.97 to $2.02, including stock option expense of $0.17 per share. The adjusted* operating margin is estimated to be in the 16.3 to 16.8 percent range, including pre-tax stock option expense of approximately $36 million. Stock option expense was previously projected to be $33 million.
The reconciliation between the projected adjusted* diluted earnings per share and earnings per share on a GAAP basis is:
 
9
 
Cash flow from operations in 2006 is now projected to range between $425 million and $475 million. The company continues to project that depreciation and amortization will range between $150 million and $160 million, and that capital expenditures will be in the $230 million to $260 million range.
*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP included within this press release, Hospira has provided certain information that is considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.
As used in this press release, "adjusted" refers to operating performance measures that exclude the non-recurring transition expenses in 2006 and 2005 related to becoming an independent, stand-alone company and charges related to the company's manufacturing optimization initiatives. In addition, the company is providing adjusted* earnings per share including pro-forma stock option expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2005 to facilitate year-over-year comparability, given the company's adoption of SFAS No. 123R on Jan. 1, 2006.
10
 
"Core net sales," as used in this press release, refer to Hospira's net sales excluding U.S. and international sales to Abbott related to transition arrangements made at the time of the spin-off, sales of Berlex imaging agents under the arrangement that terminated during the second quarter of 2005, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Management believes that core net sales provide investors an additional measure to assess the underlying sales trend of Hospira's ongoing business.
Management believes that the charges and sales excluded in the manner described above are not necessarily indicative of the company's base business results. Therefore, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when presented together with and reconciled to the comparable measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Management believes that such presentation enables investors to have more complete information with which to assess the company's results of operations and prospects. Such presentation also facilitates period-to-period comparison of Hospira's operating results. In addition, management uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Hospira may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

In the second quarter of 2006, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $11 million ($8.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. The company had previously estimated these non-recurring transitional expenses to total approximately $100 million over the two-year period ending in the second quarter of 2006. A total of $104.8 million was incurred through June 30, 2006. The company effectively completed the legal separation from Abbott during the second quarter. However, the company determined that completing the remaining transition-related matters, the majority of which relates to the company's independent information technology system, would require an additional $7 million to $10 million of estimated expenditures in the second half of 2006. The company now expects the aggregate non-recurring transition expenses to total between $112 million and $115 million.
Also included in the second-quarter 2006 GAAP diluted earnings per share were manufacturing optimization-related expenses of $15.9 million ($12.1 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, after tax), partially offset by the $7.9 million ($6.0 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, after tax) gain on the sale of the Donegal, Ireland, facility and by a $1.1 million ($0.8 million, or less than a penny per diluted share, after tax) reduction of the obligation associated with the 2005 sale of the Salt Lake City manufacturing facility. (The company's manufacturing optimization initiatives include the planned closing of the Donegal, Montreal and Ashland, Ohio, facilities; the relocation of production from the leased North Chicago facility; and the sale of the Salt Lake City facility.)
12
 
In the second quarter of 2005, Hospira incurred non-recurring pre-tax transition expenses of $10.2 million ($7.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, after tax) related to establishing an independent infrastructure. The company also incurred a charge of $13.4 million ($10.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share, after tax) for obligations related to the Salt Lake City facility sale. In addition, as previously indicated, the second-quarter 2005 GAAP results do not include stock option expense.
