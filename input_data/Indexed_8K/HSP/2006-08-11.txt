Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officer
(c) On August 11, 2006, Hospira announced that Thomas E. Werner has been appointed as its Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Terrence C. Kearney, who was previously appointed as Hospira's Chief Operating Officer. The press release announcing such appointment is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, and is incorporated by reference herein.
Summary of Terms of Employment
Compensation.
Mr. Werner will receive an annual base salary of $350,000 and an annual cash payment in lieu of perquisites of $25,000. In connection with his hiring, Mr. Werner will receive an award of 30,000 non-qualified stock options under the Hospira 2004 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan and a minimum 2006 cash incentive award.
The stock options will be awarded on September 29, 2006 (the last business day of the calendar quarter in which he was hired) with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low trading prices of Hospira common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on that date. The form of non-qualified stock option award is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Hospira's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 12, 2005. The stock options will vest in three equal annual installments and have a ten-year term.
The cash incentive award will be determined based upon Hospira's performance compared to earnings, net sales, cash flows and corporate well-being goals established by the nominations and compensation committee of Hospira's board of directors, subject to a minimum of $172,575 for 2006.
Change in Control Agreement
. Hospira and Mr. Werner will enter into a change in control agreement, a form of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.
The agreement will continue in effect until December 31, 2009, and at the end of each year will automatically be extended through the third year thereafter, unless Hospira notifies Mr. Werner that the agreement will not be extended. The agreement also automatically extends for two years following any change in control (as defined in the agreement) that occurs while it is in effect. The agreement provides that if Mr. Werner is terminated other than for specified reasons or if he elects to terminate employment under certain circumstances during a potential change in control (as defined in the agreement) or within two years following a change in control of Hospira (including termination by him for any reason during the thirty-day window period which begins six months after the date of a change in control), he is entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to 2.99 times the sum of his annual salary and bonus (assuming for this purpose that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and the pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years, or, in the case of the unpaid bonus for any completed performance period, the actual bonus earned). He will also receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including outplacement services, tax planning services and financial counseling for three years), payment of any excise taxes and other related taxes and payments for which he is responsible as a result of the agreement, and reimbursement of certain legal, tax and audit fees. The agreement limits the
conduct for which awards under the Hospira 2004 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term.

Exhibit 10.1
THIS AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), is made and entered into as of the ___ day of August, 2006 (the "Effective Date") by and between Hospira, Inc. (the "Company") and Thomas E. Werner (the "Executive");
WITNESSETH THAT:
WHEREAS, the Company considers it essential to the best interests of its shareholders to foster the continuous employment of key management personnel, and the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, a change in control might occur and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders; and
WHEREAS, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management, including the Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company;
NOW, THEREFORE, to induce the Executive to remain in the employ of the Company and in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants set forth herein, IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between the parties as follows:
1.     AGREEMENT TERM. THE INITIAL "AGREEMENT TERM" SHALL BEGIN ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE AND SHALL CONTINUE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND AS OF EACH DECEMBER 31 THEREAFTER, THE AGREEMENT TERM SHALL EXTEND AUTOMATICALLY TO THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY THEREOF UNLESS THE COMPANY GIVES NOTICE TO THE EXECUTIVE PRIOR TO THE DATE OF SUCH EXTENSION THAT THE AGREEMENT TERM WILL NOT BE EXTENDED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF A CHANGE IN CONTROL (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 7 BELOW), OCCURS DURING THE AGREEMENT TERM, THE AGREEMENT TERM SHALL CONTINUE THROUGH AND TERMINATE ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE CHANGE IN CONTROL OCCURS.
2.     ENTITLEMENT TO CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFITS. The Executive shall be entitled to the Change in Control Benefits described in Section 3 hereof if the Executive's employment by the Company is terminated during the Agreement Term but after a Change in Control (i) by the Company for any reason other than Permanent Disability or Cause, (ii) by the Executive for Good Reason or (iii) by the Executive for any
reason during the 30-day period commencing on the first date which is six months after the date of the Change in Control.  For purposes of this Agreement:
A termination of the Executive's employment shall be treated as a termination by reason of "Permanent Disability" only if, due to a mental or physical disability, the Executive is absent from the full time performance of duties with the Company for a period of at least twelve consecutive months and fails to return to the full time performance of duties within 30 days after receipt of a demand by the Company to do so.
(a)
                                 
The term "Cause" shall mean the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, no act, or failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until the Company delivers to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth above and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
(b)
                                
The term "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following circumstances without the Executive's express written consent:
(c)
                                 
a significant adverse change in the nature, scope or status of the Executive's position, authorities or duties from those in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, including, without limitation, if the Executive was, immediately prior to the Change in Control, an executive officer of a public company, the Executive ceasing to be an executive officer of a public company;
(i)
                                    
the failure by the Company to pay the Executive any portion of the Executive's current compensation;
(ii)
                                 
2
 
a reduction in the Executive's annual base salary (or a material change in the frequency of payment) as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control as the same may be increased from time to time;
(iii)
                              
the failure by the Company to award the Executive an annual bonus in any year which is at least equal to the annual bonus, awarded to the Executive under the annual bonus plan of the Company for the year immediately preceding the year of the Change in Control;
(iv)
                             
the failure by the Company to award the Executive equity-based incentive compensation (such as stock options, shares of restricted stock, or other equity-based compensation) on a periodic basis consistent with the Company's practices with respect to timing, value and terms prior to the Change in Control;
(v)
                                
the failure by the Company to continue to provide the Executive with the welfare benefits, fringe benefits and perquisites enjoyed by the Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control under any of the Company's plans or policies, including, but not limited to, those plans and policies providing pension, life insurance, medical, dental, prescription, health and accident, disability, vacation, and other executive perquisites;
(vi)
                             
the relocation of the Company's principal executive offices to a location more than thirty-five miles from the location of such offices immediately prior to the Change in Control or the Company requiring the Executive to be based anywhere other than the Company's principal executive offices except for required travel to the Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with the Executive's business travel obligations immediately prior to the Change in Control; or
(vii)
                          
the failure of the Company to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to the Company to assume and agree to perform this Agreement as contemplated by Section 16.
(viii)
                       
3
 
For purposes of any determination regarding the existence of Good Reason, any good faith determination by the Executive that Good Reason exists shall be conclusive.
3.     CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFITS. In the event of a termination of employment entitling the Executive to benefits in accordance with Section 2, the Executive shall receive the following:
The Executive shall be entitled to receive the following employee welfare benefits: medical, health and accident, dental, prescription, disability, and life insurance coverage for the Executive (and, where applicable under the Company's welfare benefit plans, the Executive's family) through the third anniversary of the Executive's date of termination of employment, or, if earlier, the date on which the Executive becomes employed by another employer. The benefits provided by the Company shall be no less favorable in terms of coverage and cost to the Executive than those provided under the Company's welfare benefit plans applicable to the Executive (and, where applicable, the Executive's family) prior to the Change in Control, determined as if the Executive remained in the employ of the Company through such third anniversary.
(a)
                                 
If the Executive's date of termination occurs after the end of a performance period applicable to an annual incentive (bonus) award, and prior to the payment of the award for the period, the Executive shall be entitled to a lump sum payment in cash no later than twenty (20) business days after the date of termination equal to the greatest of (i) the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for that period, as determined under the terms of that incentive award arrangement, (ii) the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for that period, with the determination of the amount of such award based on an assumption that the target level of performance had been achieved or (iii) the Executive's average annual incentive (bonus) award for the three annual performance periods preceding that period (provided that if the Executive was not a participant in the incentive award arrangement for any of those three prior years, the averaging period shall be reduced from three years to the number of years during the three year period in which the Executive was a participant; and further provided that if the Executive's award for any such year was reduced because the Executive was not a participant for the full year, such amount shall be annualized for purposes of the computation in this clause (iii)).
(b)
                                
4
 
For any annual incentive (bonus) plan or arrangement in which the Executive participates for the performance period in which the Executive's termination of employment occurs, the Executive shall be entitled to a lump sum payment in cash no later than twenty (20) business days after the date of termination equal to the greater of (i) the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for the performance period that includes the date of termination, with the determination of the amount of such award based on an assumption that the target level of performance has been achieved or (ii) the Executive's average annual incentive (bonus) award for the three annual performance periods preceding the performance period that includes the date of termination  (provided that if the Executive was not a participant in the incentive award arrangement for any of those three prior years, the averaging period shall be reduced from three years to the number of years during the three year period in which the Executive was a participant; and further provided that if the Executive's award for any such year was reduced because the Executive was not a participant for the full year, such amount shall be annualized for purposes of the computation in this clause (ii)); provided that such payment shall be subject to a pro-rata reduction to reflect the number of days in the performance period following the date of termination. The amount payable under this paragraph (c) shall be in lieu of any amounts that may otherwise be due to the Executive with respect to any annual incentive (bonus) plan or arrangement in which the Executive participates for the performance period in which the Executive's date of termination occurs.
(c)
                                 
The Executive shall be entitled to a lump sum payment in cash no later than twenty (20) business days after the Executive's date of termination equal to the sum of:
(d)
                                
an amount equal to 2.99 times the Executive's annual salary rate in effect on the date of the Change in Control or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to the date of termination; plus
(i)
                                    
an amount equal to 2.99 times the greater of (x) the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for the performance period that includes the date of the Executive's termination of employment, with the determination of the amount of such award based on an assumption that the target level of performance has been achieved or (y) the Executive's average
(ii)
                                 
5
annual incentive (bonus) award for the three annual performance periods preceding the performance period that includes the date of termination (provided that if the Executive was not a participant in the incentive award arrangement for any of those three prior years, the averaging period shall be reduced from three years to the number of years during the three year period in which the Executive was a participant; and further provided that if the Executive's award for any such year was reduced because the Executive was not a participant for the full year, such amount shall be annualized for purposes of the computation in this clause (y).
The amount payable under this paragraph (d) shall be inclusive of the amounts, if any, to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled as severance pay under any severance pay plan, or by law and shall be in addition to (and not inclusive of) any amount payable under any written agreement(s) directly between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
The Company shall provide the Executive with outplacement services and tax and financial counseling suitable to the Executive's position through the third anniversary of the date of the Executive's termination of employment, or, if earlier, the date on which the Executive becomes employed by another employer.
(e)
                                 
If the Executive is a participant in the Hospira Performance Incentive Plan or any successor thereto, the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for the performance period which includes the date of termination under paragraphs (c) and (d)(ii) above and, if applicable, for the period preceding the date of termination under paragraph (b) shall, be determined under the bonus levels communicated in writing to the Executive by the Company for such year.
4.     MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. Except as set forth in paragraph 3(a) with respect to benefits, the Company shall not be entitled to set off against the amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement any amounts owed to the Company by the Executive, any amounts earned by the Executive in other employment after the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, or any amounts which might have been earned by the Executive in other employment had the Executive sought such other employment.

5.     MAKE-WHOLE PAYMENTS. If any payment or benefit to which the Executive (or any person on account of the Executive) is entitled, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, in connection with a Change in Control or the Executive's termination of employment (a "Payment") constitutes a "parachute payment" within the meaning of section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and as a result thereof the Executive is subject to a tax under section 4999 of the Code, or any successor thereto, (an "Excise Tax"), the Company shall pay to the Executive an additional amount (the "Make-Whole Amount") which is intended to make the Executive whole for such Excise Tax. The Make-Whole Amount shall be equal to (i) the amount of the Excise Tax, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of any interest, penalties, fines or additions to any tax which are imposed in connection with the imposition of such Excise Tax, plus (iii) all income, excise and other applicable taxes imposed on the Executive under the laws of any Federal, state or local government or taxing authority by reason of the payments required under clauses (i) and (ii) and this clause (iii).
For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the Executive shall be deemed to be taxed at the highest marginal rate under all applicable local, state, federal and foreign income tax laws for the year in which the Make-Whole Amount is paid. The Make-Whole Amount payable with respect to an Excise Tax shall be paid by the Company coincident with the Payment with respect to which such Excise Tax relates.
(a)
                                 
All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made initially by the Company and the Company shall provide prompt written notice thereof to the Executive to enable the Executive to timely file all applicable tax returns. Upon request of the Executive, the Company shall provide the Executive with sufficient tax and compensation data to enable the Executive or the Executive's tax advisor to independently make the calculations described in subparagraph (a) above and the Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable fees and expenses incurred for any such verification.
(b)
                                
If the Executive gives written notice to the Company of any objection to the results of the Company's calculations within 60 days of the Executive's receipt of written notice thereof, the dispute shall be referred for determination to independent tax counsel selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive ("Tax Counsel"). The Company shall pay all fees and expenses of such Tax Counsel. Pending such determination by Tax Counsel, the Company shall pay the Executive the Make-Whole Amount as determined by it in good faith. The Company shall pay the Executive any additional amount determined by Tax
(c)
                                 
7
Counsel to be due under this Section 5 (together with interest thereon at a rate equal to 120% of the Federal short-term rate determined under section 1274(d) of the Code) promptly after such determination.
The determination by Tax Counsel shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties unless the Internal Revenue Service, a court of competent jurisdiction, or such other duly empowered governmental body or agency (a "Tax Authority") determines that the Executive owes a greater or lesser amount of Excise Tax with respect to any Payment than the amount determined by Tax Counsel.
(d)
                                
If a Taxing Authority makes a claim against the Executive which, if successful, would require the Company to make a payment under this Section 5, the Executive agrees to contest the claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, on request of the Company subject to the following conditions:
(e)
                                 
The Executive shall notify the Company of any such claim within 10 days of becoming aware thereof. In the event that the Company desires the claim to be contested, it shall promptly (but in no event more than 30 days after the notice from the Executive or such shorter time as the Taxing Authority may specify for responding to such claim) request the Executive to contest the claim. The Executive shall not make any payment of any tax which is the subject of the claim before the Executive has given the notice or during the 30-day period thereafter unless the Executive receives written instructions from the Company to make such payment together with an advance of funds sufficient to make the requested payment plus any amounts payable under this Section 5 determined as if such advance were an Excise Tax, in which case the Executive will act promptly in accordance with such instructions.
(i)
                                    
If the Company so requests, the Executive will contest the claim by either paying the tax claimed and suing for a refund in the appropriate court or contesting the claim in the United States Tax Court or other appropriate court, as directed by the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any request by the Company for the Executive to pay the tax shall be accompanied by an advance from the
(ii)
                                 
8
Company to the Executive of funds sufficient to make the requested payment plus any amounts payable under this Section 5 determined as if such advance were an Excise Tax. If directed by the Company in writing the Executive will take all action necessary to compromise or settle the claim, but in no event will the Executive compromise or settle the claim or cease to contest the claim without the written consent of the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Executive may take any such action if the Executive waives in writing the Executive's right to a payment under this Section 5 for any amounts payable in connection with such claim. The Executive agrees to cooperate in good faith with the Company in contesting the claim and to comply with any reasonable request from the Company concerning the contest of the claim, including the pursuit of administrative remedies, the appropriate forum for any judicial proceedings, and the legal basis for contesting the claim. Upon request of the Company, the Executive shall take appropriate appeals of any judgment or decision that would require the Company to make a payment under this Section 5. Provided that the Executive is in compliance with the provisions of this section, the Company shall be liable for and indemnify the Executive against any loss in connection with, and all costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, which may be incurred as a result of, contesting the claim, and shall provide to the Executive within 30 days after each written request therefor by the Executive cash advances or reimbursement for all such costs and expenses actually incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Executive as a result of contesting the claim.
Should a Tax Authority finally determine that an additional Excise Tax is owed, then the Company shall pay an additional Make-Whole Amount to the Executive in a manner consistent with this Section 5 with respect to any additional Excise Tax and any assessed interest, fines, or penalties. If any Excise Tax as calculated by the Company or Tax Counsel, as the case may be, is finally determined by a Tax Authority to exceed the amount required to be paid under applicable law, then the Executive shall repay such excess to the Company within 30 days of such determination; provided that such repayment shall be
(f)
                                   
9
reduced by the amount of any taxes paid by the Executive on such excess which is not offset by the tax benefit attributable to the repayment.
6.     TERMINATION DURING POTENTIAL CHANGE IN CONTROL. If a Potential Change in Control (as defined in Section 8) occurs during the Agreement Term, and the Company terminates the Executive's employment for reasons other than Permanent Disability or Cause during such Potential Change in Control, the Executive shall be entitled to receive the benefits that the Executive would have received under Section 3, such benefits to be calculated based upon the Executive's compensation prior to the actual termination of employment but paid within 20 business days of the date of such termination.
7.     CHANGE IN CONTROL. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred on the earliest of the following dates:

(d)

The parties to the Agreement Regarding Change in Control dated as of the __ day of August, 2006 (the "Agreement") recognize that a bona fide dispute as to certain matters may arise from time to time during the term of the Agreement which relates to either party's rights and/or obligations. To have such a dispute resolved by this Alternative Dispute Resolution ("ADR") provision, a party first must send written notice of the dispute to the other party for attempted resolution by good faith negotiations between the Executive and the Company within twenty-eight (28) days after such notice is received (all references to "days" in the ADR provision are to calendar days).
If the matter has not been resolved within twenty-eight (28) days of the notice of dispute, or if the parties fail to meet within such twenty-eight (28) days, either party may initiate an ADR proceeding as provided herein. The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel in such a proceeding.
1.             To begin an ADR proceeding, a party shall provide written notice to the other party of the issues to be resolved by ADR. Within fourteen (14) days after its receipt of such notice, the other party may, by written notice to the party initiating the ADR, add additional issues to be resolved within the same ADR.
2.             Within twenty-one (21) days following receipt of the original ADR notice, the parties shall select a mutually acceptable neutral to preside in the resolution of any disputes in this ADR proceeding. If the parties are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable neutral within such period, either party may request the President of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution ("CPR"), 366 Madison Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10017, to select a neutral pursuant to the following procedures:
The CPR shall submit to the parties a list of not less than five (5) candidates within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the request, along with a for each candidate.  No candidate shall be an employee, director or shareholder of either party or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.
(a)
                                 
Curriculum Vitae
Such list shall include a statement of disclosure by each candidate of any circumstances likely to affect his or her impartiality.
(b)
                                
Each party shall number the candidates in order of preference  (with the number one (1) signifying the greatest preference) and shall deliver the list to the CPR within seven (7) days following receipt of the list of candidates. If a party believes a conflict of interest exists regarding any of the candidates, that party shall provide a written explanation of the conflict to the CPR along with its list showing its order
(c)
                                 
1
of preference for the candidates. Any party failing to return a list of preferences on time shall be deemed to have no order of preference.
If the parties collectively have identified fewer than three  (3) candidates deemed to have conflicts, the CPR immediately shall designate as the neutral the candidate for whom the parties collectively have indicated the greatest preference. If a tie should result between two candidates, the CPR may designate either candidate. If the parties collectively have identified three (3) or more candidates deemed to have conflicts, the CPR shall review the explanations regarding conflicts and, in its sole discretion, may either (i) immediately designate as the neutral the candidate for whom the parties collectively have indicated the greatest preference, or (ii) issue a new list of not less than five (5) candidates, in which case the procedures set forth in subparagraphs 2(a)-2(d) shall be repeated.
(d)
                                
3.             No earlier than twenty-eight (28) days or later than fifty-six (56) days after selection, the neutral shall hold a hearing to resolve each of the issues identified by the parties. The ADR proceeding shall take place at a location agreed upon by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, the neutral shall designate a location other than the principal place of business of either party or any of the subsidiaries or affiliates.
4.             At least seven (7) days prior to the hearing, each party shall submit the following to the other party and the neutral:
a copy of all exhibits on which such party intends to rely in any oral or written presentation to the neutral;

a list of any witnesses such party intends to call at the hearing, and a short summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness;
(b)
                                
a proposed ruling on each issue to be resolved, together with a request for a specific damage award or other remedy for each issue. The proposed rulings and remedies shall not contain any recitation of the facts or any legal arguments and shall not exceed one (1) page per issue.
(c)
                                 
a brief in support of such party's proposed rulings and remedies, provided that the brief shall not exceed twenty (20) pages. This page limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR proceeding. Except as expressly set forth in subparagraphs 4(a) - 4(d), no discovery shall be required or permitted by any means, including

Each party shall be entitled, but not required, to make an opening statement, to present regular or rebuttal testimony, documents or other evidence, to cross-examine witnesses and to make a closing argument. Cross-examination of witnesses shall occur immediately after their direct testimony, and cross-examination time shall be charged against the party conducting the cross-examination.
(b)
                                
The party initiating the ADR shall begin the hearing and, if it chooses to make an opening statement, shall address not only issues it raised, but also any issues raised by the responding party. The responding party, if it chooses to make an opening statement, also shall address all issues raised in the ADR. Thereafter, the presentation of regular and rebuttal testimony and documents, other evidence and closing arguments shall proceed in the same sequence.
(c)
                                 
Except when testifying, witnesses shall be excluded from the hearing until closing arguments.
(d)
                                
Settlement negotiations, including any statements made therein, shall not be admissible under any circumstances. Affidavits prepared for purposes of the ADR hearing also shall not be admissible. As to all other matters, the neutral shall have sole discretion regarding the admissibility of any evidence.
(e)
                                 
6.           Within seven (7) days following completion of the hearing, each party may submit to the other party and the neutral a post-hearing brief in support of its proposed rulings and remedies, provided that such brief shall not contain or discuss any new evidence and shall not exceed ten  (10) pages. This page limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR proceeding.
7.             The neutral shall rule on each disputed issue within fourteen (14) days following completion of the hearing. Such ruling shall adopt in its entirety the proposed ruling and remedy of one of the parties on each disputed issue but may adopt one party's proposed rulings and remedies on some issues and the other party's proposed
3
rulings and remedies on other issues. The neutral shall not issue any written opinion or otherwise explain the basis of the ruling.
8.             The neutral shall be paid a reasonable fee plus expenses by the Company. The Company shall bear its own fees and expenses. The Executive's fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed by the Company to the extent provided by the Agreement.
9.             The rulings of the neutral and the allocation of fees and expenses shall be binding, non-reviewable, and non-appealable, and may be entered as a final judgment in any court having jurisdiction.
10.           Except as provided in Section 9 or as required by law, the existence of the dispute, any settlement negotiations, the ADR hearing, any submissions (including exhibits, testimony, proposed rulings, and briefs), and the rulings shall be deemed Confidential Information. The neutral shall have the authority to impose sanctions for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information.
