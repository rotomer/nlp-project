In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.

(d)           To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but
also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)           The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f)            The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
(g)           The Company and the Underwriters agree that the only information furnished by the Underwriters to the Company expressly for use in the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus is (i) the names of the Underwriters on the cover page, (ii) the first paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting", concerning the names of the Underwriters and the principal amounts of the Securities purchased, (iii) the first sentence of the fifth paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting", concerning the terms of the offering by the Underwriters and (iv) the seventh paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting", concerning short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales by Underwriters.
 
9.             .  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over the counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States or other relevant jurisdiction shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State or relevant foreign country authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets, currency exchange rates or controls or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement) or the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement).

In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

This Security will initially be offered in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000.
 
The Company may redeem the Securities of this series, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, subject to the payment of a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) on such Securities discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at
a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 50 basis points.   In each case, accrued and unpaid interest will also be paid to but excluding the redemption date.
 
If the Company has given notice as provided in the Indenture and funds for the redemption of any Securities of this series called for redemption have been made available on the redemption date, such Securities will cease to bear interest on the date fixed for redemption.  Thereafter, the only right of the Holders of such Securities will be to receive payment of the redemption price.
 
The Company will prepare and mail a notice of redemption to each holder of Securities to be redeemed by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 calendar days prior to the date fixed for redemption. On and after a redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or before a redemption date, the Company will deposit with a paying agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Securities to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee pro rata or by lot or by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate.
 
The Company will notify the Trustee at least 45 days prior to giving notice of redemption (or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee) of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed and their redemption date.  If less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select which Securities are to be
redeemed in a manner it deems to be fair and appropriate.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by a Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below) as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities called for redemption, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new
 
issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of Securities called for redemption.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the calculation agent obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means Banc of America Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, and three other primary U.S. Government securities dealers selected by the Company, and each of their respective successors. If any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, the Company will substitute another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, on any redemption date, the average, as determined by the calculation agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by each Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding that redemption date.
 
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Securities called for redemption that would be due after the related redemption date but for that redemption. If that redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to the Securities called for redemption, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on such Securities will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Securities called for redemption to such redemption date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding that redemption date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date.
 
The Securities of this series do not provide for a sinking fund.
 
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities as described above, holders of Securities will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of their Securities pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer"). In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will be required to mail a notice to holders of Securities describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures required by the Securities and described
 
in such notice.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Securities, the Company will be required to comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Securities by virtue of such conflicts.
 
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will be required, to the extent lawful, to:
 
                 
accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
