On May 14, 2009, at the annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholders of Hospira, Inc. approved amendments to the Hospira 2004 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan ("2004 Stock Plan").  Amendments to the 2004 Stock Plan were adopted by Hospira's Board of Directors on March 3, 2009, subject to shareholder approval at the annual meeting.
 
The 2004 Stock Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee and provides for the grant of stock option awards, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and other cash and stock-based awards to our employees and directors, including our executive officers.  The 2004 Stock Plan was amended to extend the term of the 2004 Stock Plan by 10 years to May 14, 2019, and to increase the number of shares that may be granted during the life of the 2004 Stock Plan by 13,000,000 shares.  Other amendments were made to the 2004 Stock Plan to ensure that it conforms to best practices.
 
For a more detailed description of the 2004 Stock Plan, as amended, see Hospira's 2009 Proxy Statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2009.  The foregoing description of the 2004 Stock Plan, as amended, is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the plan, which was included as Exhibit A to the 2009 Proxy Statement and is incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.
