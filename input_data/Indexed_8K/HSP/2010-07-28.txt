Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On July 28, 2010, Hospira, Inc. issued a press release announcing its 2010 second quarter results of operations. Such press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
In the press release, Hospira uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others, net sales at constant currency, adjusted gross profit, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures adjust for certain specified items that are described in the press release and attached schedules. Hospira's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into Hospira's ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Item 9.01  Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
(d)     Exhibits.
 
This exhibit is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 hereof and should not be deemed to be "filed" under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
LAKE FOREST, Ill., July 28, 2010  Hospira, Inc. (NYSE: HSP), a leading global specialty pharmaceutical and medication delivery company, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010. Net sales for the quarter were $968 million, and adjusted* diluted earnings per share were $0.86. (Adjusted* measures exclude certain specified items as described later in this press release and the attached schedules.)
 
"Hospira delivered another solid quarter, driven by strong performance in our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals business and by continued momentum of our Project Fuel optimization initiatives," said Christopher B. Begley, chairman and chief executive officer. "We made significant progress in advancing our business during the quarter, launching our first product from Hospira India, commercializing our second biosimilar product in Europe and strengthening our position in acute-care proprietary pharmaceuticals. We are highly focused on executing our strategy of investing for growth and improving margins and cash flow, as well as on driving quality improvements across our global manufacturing organization. We remain on track to achieve our full-year earnings projections."
 
 
Second-Quarter 2010 Results
 
The following table highlights selected financial results for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009:
 
 
Results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) include items as detailed in the schedules attached to this press release.
 
Net sales increased 1.2 percent to $968 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $957 million in the second quarter of 2009. Strong sales in Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals, resulting from the U.S. sales of the generic oncolytic oxaliplatin and Precedex, Hospira's proprietary sedation agent, were primarily offset by a decline in Medication Management Systems as a result of the company's voluntary hold on shipments of its Symbiq Infusion System to new customers.
 
Adjusted* income from operations increased 20.6 percent to $213 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $177 million in the second quarter of 2009. Driving the majority of the increase were more favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiency from the company's Project Fuel optimization initiatives, offset by charges associated with certain quality and product-related matters.
 
The effective tax rate on an adjusted basis* in the quarter was 23.8 percent, up from the second-quarter 2009 rate of 21.5 percent. The increase is primarily related to the expiration of certain U.S. tax credits in 2010 as well as a shift in earnings mix to higher tax jurisdictions relative to the second quarter of 2009.
 
Cash Flow
 
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2010 was $144 million, compared to the $236 million generated for the same period in 2009. The decrease primarily reflects the timing of chargeback payments associated with the U.S. sales of oxaliplatin, increased inventory levels and higher U.S. income tax payments.
 
Capital expenditures were $79 million for the first six months of 2010, compared to $78 million for the first six months of 2009.
 
2010 Projections
 
Hospira is maintaining guidance for net sales growth of approximately 3 to 5 percent on a constant-currency basis. Including the impact of foreign exchange, the company currently expects net sales growth to also be 3 to 5 percent.
 
Hospira is maintaining its adjusted* diluted earnings per share projection for full-year 2010, which is expected to range between $3.35 and $3.45 per share.
 
The reconciliation between the projected 2010 adjusted* diluted earnings per share and GAAP diluted earnings per share follows:
 
 
The adjusting items are shown net of tax in aggregate of $83 million, which is calculated for the specified adjustments stated above, based on the statutory tax rate in the various tax jurisdictions in which the items are expected to occur.
The company now expects cash flow from operations to range between $525 million and $575 million. The projected range for depreciation and amortization remains unchanged at $250 million to $260 million, as does the projected range for capital expenditures, at $195 million to $215 million.
 
*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Adjusted measures used in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the schedules attached to this release. For more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, please see Hospira's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date of this press release.

This financial measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period. Management believes the use of this financial measure aids in the understanding of our change in net sales without the impact of foreign currency.
