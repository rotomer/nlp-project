In a press release dated November 15, 2010, Hospira commented on the pending approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of its application for docetaxel, a generic version of Sanofi-Aventis's oncolytic Taxotere.  Since our press release, the FDA has requested amendments to Hospira's final product labeling, and Hospira has submitted the requested amendments for consideration.  While Hospira cannot predict the timing for conversion of its tentatively approved docetaxel to final approval, Hospira continues to work closely with the FDA to expedite this matter.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
