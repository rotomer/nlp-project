On February 2, 2011,
Hospira, Inc. ("Hospira") announced a re-alignment of its product line net sales presentation for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Previously, Hospira had presented net sales information in four separate product lines: specialty injectable pharmaceuticals, other pharmaceuticals, medication management systems, and other devices. In March 2009, Hospira announced Project Fuel, a restructuring and optimization plan. As part of Project Fuel, Hospira disposed of the non-strategic critical care business in 2009, which was part of the other devices product line.  As a result of that divestiture, Hospira combined the remaining products included in the former other devices product line into a new single device product line called medication management.  As a result, Hospira has three product lines:  special ty injectable pharmaceuticals, medication management, and other pharmaceuticals. Medication management now includes infusion pumps, related software and services, dedicated administration sets, gravity administration sets, critical care products (through August 2009) and other device products.
 
Furnished in Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated by reference, are schedules that present Hospira's 2010, 2009 and 2008 net sales information (both quarterly and annual net sales by product line by reportable segment for all periods presented) that have been reclassified to reflect the re-aligned product line net sales presentations.
 
The re-alignment has no impact on Hospira's previously reported historical net sales and reportable segments under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
