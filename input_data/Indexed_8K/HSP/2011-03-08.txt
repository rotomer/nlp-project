Mr. Ball (age 55) joins the Company after a 16-year career at Allergan, Inc., a multi-specialty healthcare company, where he held several senior leadership positions.  More recently, from February 2006 until joining the Company, Mr. Ball served as President of Allergan.  From October 2003 to February 2006, Mr. Ball served as Executive Vice President and President, Pharmaceuticals of Allergan.  Since 2000, Mr. Ball has served on the board of directors of STEC, Inc., a publicly-traded manufacturer and marketer of computer memory and hard drive storage solutions.
 
A copy of the letter from the Company to Mr. Ball related to his employment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  The following description of the terms of the letter is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the letter.
 
Mr. Ball will receive an annual base salary of $975,000, and will be eligible to receive an annual incentive award under the Company's performance incentive plan, which for fiscal year 2011, will be a target award of 120% of his full year base salary. In addition, Mr. Ball will receive the following long-term incentive awards on March 31, 2011 (the last trading day of the quarter that includes his start date):
 
                 
A one-time special hiring incentive stock option award valued at $500,000;
                 
An initial normal annual long-term incentive award consisting of stock options valued at $1,950,000 and performance share units valued at $2,925,000;

All of the grants listed above are governed by the terms of the Company's 2004 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and the individual award agreements, except for the

This grant shall vest ratably over three years, subject to immediate vesting upon your involuntary termination by Hospira without "cause" or your resignation with "good reason" as those terms are defined below. The grant will be governed by the terms of the Hospira 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, and the individual award agreement. The form of award agreement for the grant of the stock options is enclosed for your review. The grant values expressed above will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole share of Hospira stock. To determine the number of option shares, the grant value will be divided by t he Black-Scholes value determined as of the last trading day of the calendar quarter (March 31, 2011).
 
BASE SALARY
 
Your initial base salary will be at the annual rate of $975,000. Salaries will generally be reviewed each calendar year and may be increased, but not decreased, by the Board of Directors based on performance, market conditions or other business factors consistent with Hospira's Compensation Administration Program.
 
SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
 
In this position, you will be eligible to receive annual incentive awards under Hospira's performance incentive plan. For fiscal year 2011, your participation target will be 120% of your full year base salary, regardless of the actual salary paid to you during 2011. The amount of incentive compensation you actually earn is determined by the Board of Directors and is dependent on Hospira's success in achieving defined goals. Your participation in Hospira's performance incentive plan will be governed by the terms of the plan.
 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION  INITIAL AND ANNUAL GRANTS
 
Contingent upon your starting work at Hospira on or before March 28, 2011, you will receive:
 
(a)
         
A grant value of $1,950,000 in Hospira stock options to be effective on the last trading day of the quarter that includes your start date.
 
 
 
(b)
        
A grant value of $2,925,000 in Hospira performance share units to be effective on the last trading day of the quarter that includes your start date.
 
You will be eligible to participate in future grants under the LTIP, subject to compensation committee approval. All grants will be governed by the terms of the LTIP and individual award agreements. The award agreements for your initial and subsequent grants will provide for immediate vesting upon your involuntary termination by Hospira without "cause" or your resignation with "good reason". Forms of award agreements for grants of stock options and performance share units are enclosed for your review.
 
For purposes of this Employment Offer and the individual award agreements, the definitions of "cause" and "good reason" will have the following meaning:
 
The term Cause' shall mean the willful engaging by the Participant in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, no act, or failure to act, on the Participant's part shall be deemed willful' unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Participant not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Participant's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until the Company delivers to the Participant a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the Participant and an opportunity for the Part icipant, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Participant was guilty of conduct set forth above and specifying the particulars thereof in detail."
 
The term "Good Reason" shall mean any of the following events, absent the Participant's consent: a reduction of the Participant's base salary; a material diminution in the Participant's authorities, duties, or responsibilities; or a material breach by the Company of any agreement between the Company and the Participant. For each event described above, the Participant must furnish notice to the Board within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the event, the Company shall have thirty (30) days after receiving such notice in which to cure, and if the failure is not cured by the end of the cure period the Participant must terminate employment within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the cure period.
 
The grant values expressed above will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole share of Hospira stock or performance share unit. To determine the number of option shares, the grant value will be divided by the Black-Scholes value determined as of the last trading day of the calendar quarter (March 31
st
 in the case of the initial grants above). The strike price for the options is the average of the high and low on the same final trading day. To determine the number of performance units, the grant value will be divided by the Monte-Carlo value determined as of the last trading day of the calendar quarter.
 
LONG TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION  "MAKE-WHOLE" GRANTS
 
Contingent upon your starting work at Hospira on or before March 28, 2011, you will receive:
 
(a)
         
A grant value of $3,394,208 in shares of Hospira restricted stock to compensate you for the loss of unvested options from your prior employer.
(b)
        
A grant value of $710,000 in shares of Hospira restricted stock to compensate you for the loss of unvested restricted stock from your prior employer.
(c)
         
A grant value of $1,929,621 in shares of Hospira restricted stock to compensate you for the loss of retirement benefits with your prior employer.
 
 
The foregoing grants of restricted stock shall be effective on the last trading day of the quarter that includes your start date. These restricted stock grants shall vest ratably over three years. By way of illustration, if you remain employed on March 31, 2012, you will become one-third vested in the restricted stock granted under clauses (a), (b) and (c). However, these restricted stock grants shall immediately vest upon your involuntary termination by Hospira without "cause" or your resignation with "good reason" as those terms are defined above. All grants are governed by the terms of the Hospira 2004 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended ("LTIP") and individual award agreements, except that the clawback provisions contained in the standard form of award agreement shall not apply. The form of award agreements for grants of restricted stock is enclosed for your re view. The grant values expressed above will be rounded up or down to the nearest whole share of Hospira stock. To determine the number of restricted stock units, the grant values are divided by the closing price of Hospira stock on the last trading day of the calendar quarter (March 31, 2011).

(c)           If the Participant engages in any activity described in Section 5(a) or Section 5(b) above without the written consent of the Committee, the Company, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, may (i) cancel and terminate all of the Participant's unexercised, unexpired or unpaid Options (whether vested or unvested) under the Plan, and (ii) rescind any exercise, payment or delivery under any Option occurring within 12 months prior to, or at any time following, the date of the Participant's termination of employment for any reason.

"Gain realized" shall be the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price, multiplied by the number of Shares purchased.
 
6.             .  Subject to the Company's Executive Compensation Recovery Policy, and notwithstanding anything in the Option Terms to the contrary, if the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the number of Covered Shares determined to be delivered under the Option Terms or the value of such Options was based on the Company's published financial statements that have been restated then, at the Committee's direction, the Company may, but in no case later than 60 months of such restatement:

The Committee may, in its sole discretion, effect any such recovery by obtaining repayment directly from the Participant, setting off the amount owed to the Company against any amount or award that would otherwise be granted by the Company to the Participant, reducing any future compensation or benefit to the Participant or any combination thereof.  "Gain realized" shall be as determined under Section 5(c).
 
7.             .  Subject to the Option Terms and the Plan, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by filing a written notice with the Secretary of the Company at its corporate headquarters prior to the Company's close of business on the last business day that occurs prior to the Expiration Date.  Such notice shall specify the number of shares of Stock which the Participant elects to purchase, and shall be accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price for such shares of Stock indicated by the Participant's election.  Payment may be by cash or by check payable to the Company, or except as otherwise provided by the Committee before the Option is exercised:  (i) all or a portion of the Exercise Price may be paid by the Participant by delivery of shares of Stock (by actual delivery or by attestation) owned by the Participant and acceptable to the Committee having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; and (ii) the Participant may pay the Exercise Price by authorizing a third party to sell shares of Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise.  Except as otherwise provided by the Committee prior to exercise, payments made with shares of Stock in accordance with clause (i) above shall be limited to shares held by the Participant for not less than six months prior to the payment date.  The Option shall not be exercisable if and to the extent the Company determines that such exercise would violate applicable state or Federal securities laws or the rules and regula tions of any securities exchange on which the Stock is traded and shall not be exercisable during any blackout period established by the Company from time to time.

Enclosure (3)d
Highlights
 
This booklet outlines the terms of the Hospira Performance Share Unit program ("Program") for fiscal years 2011-2013 (the "Performance Cycle") and provides detailed information relating to the grant of Performance Share Units ("PSUs"). Awards granted under the Program are made from shares of Hospira common stock authorized under the Hospira 2004 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan").
 
The key features of this Program are summarized below. In some countries other than the United States, variations in Program design may occur in order to comply with local laws and tax regulations.
 
Purpose
 
Hospira has created the Program in order to:
 
                 
Focus executive management's attention on the long-term performance results of Hospira as measured by total shareholder return ("TSR")
 
                 
Provide incentive compensation opportunities based upon the achievement of specific TSR results
 
                 
Provide, in combination with stock options, a competitive long-term compensation opportunity to Participants and assist in attracting and retaining highly qualified and motivated executive talent
 
Participation
 
Participation in the Program is limited to individuals elected as corporate officers and other senior officers designated for participation by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hospira, Inc.
Performance Share Units (PSU)
 
Performance Share Unit awards are initially granted in the form of a target number of PSUs at the beginning of the Performance Cycle. At the end of the Performance Cycle, the number of PSUs earned will be converted to shares of Hospira common stock. Based upon the actual performance results, the award can range between 0% and 200% of the target PSUs granted.
 
PSUs have special restrictions that are based upon both the continued service of Program Participants and Hospira's performance against the established financial performance goal. These restrictions include a prohibition against the transfer of the PSUs during the Performance Cycle to another individual or entity. Any shares not awarded at the end of the Performance Cycle are forfeited.
 
Hospira may substitute or offer alternative forms of incentive compensation if it determines that tax or legal regulations in a country provide more favorable treatment for those alternative forms of incentive compensation or as a voluntary alternative to PSUs, subject to any applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
                 
PSUs under this Program are granted only during 2011, the first fiscal year of the Performance Cycle. At the end of the Performance Cycle, 2013, the target PSUs are converted to shares of Hospira common stock and issued to Program Participants in stock based upon the actual performance results; however, fractional shares are paid in cash.
                 
The number of shares earned is dependent upon the extent to which the pre-established performance goal is achieved during the Performance Cycle. Participants may earn between 0% - 200% of the target PSUs originally granted based upon the performance results.
                 
Participants do not have voting rights on PSUs during the Performance Cycle.
 
Performance Measure
 
Performance under the 2011-2013 Program is measured as follows:
 
                 
Relative Total Shareholder Return ("RTSR") compared to peer companies (identified in Appendix I). Relative Total Shareholder Return is defined as the percentile rank of Hospira's Total Shareholder Return compared to the Total Shareholder Return of Hospira's peer companies over the Performance Cycle. Total Shareholder Return is the rate of return on a share of common stock, reflecting stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends and the compounding effect of dividends, adjusted appropriately to reflect stock splits, spin-offs and similar transactions.
 
The Performance Cycle begins January 1, 2011 and ends December 31, 2013, and is aligned with Hospira's fiscal years 2011 through 2013.
 
The Base Price of Hospira's common stock, and each peer company's common stock, is the average of the closing prices for the last 30 trading days before the start of the Performance Cycle. The average closing price of Hospira stock for the last 30 trading days of FY10 preceding the Performance Cycle is $56.44 and serves as the base for relative comparisons over the Performance Cycle.
The payment levels at various percentile rankings against the peer companies are shown in the following table:
 
 
Form and Time of Payment
 
Vested awards are paid in shares of Hospira common stock. Any required tax withholding will be taken from the Hospira shares that have been earned.
 
Except upon a change in control or as a Participant specifies in a Notice of Deferral Election containing specified forms of deferrals filed within limits and rules established to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, all payments will be made no later than 90 days after the end of the Performance Cycle.
 
Dividend Equivalents or Dividends
 
No dividend or Dividend Equivalents will be paid or accrued on behalf of the Participants during the period when the PSUs have not vested.
 
Award Grant Notice and Agreement
 
Each Participant will receive a PSU Grant Notice and Agreement ("Grant Notice") specifying the target grant PSUs and the terms and conditions applicable to the grant. The Grant Notice and Agreement and this Program Description should be retained with the Participant's other important documents.
Tax Consequences
 
United States
 
Under current United States tax laws, a Participant does not realize any taxable income from the PSUs when they are initially granted. The taxable event occurs on the Transfer Date, except to the extent that a Participant that is subject to the U.S. federal income tax has elected to defer distribution of the shares until a later date ("Deferred Payment Date"). The market value of Hospira common stock on the Transfer Date or the Deferred Payment Date, as the case may be, will determine the amount of taxable income. When the number of shares actually earned has been determined, the market value of the shares on the Transfer Date or the Deferred Payment Date is considered income to the Participant. This amount is then subject to applicable federal, state and local withholding. Amounts necessary to settle the tax-withholding obligation will be withheld from the shares that would otherwise have been distri buted to the Participant. Federal tax will be withheld at the required statutory supplemental federal tax rate in effect at the time of the distribution.
 
Under U.S. tax law, Participants will not be taxed until the end of the Performance Cycle.
 
Countries other than the United States
 
Tax laws vary among countries, so Participants are advised to seek counsel concerning the tax consequences of this grant in their respective countries of taxation. In most cases, Participants incur no taxable income from PSUs when initially awarded until the Transfer Date. When the shares are earned, the market value of the shares on the Transfer Date is typically considered income. For individuals residing outside the U.S. and not subject to U.S. tax laws, taxes may still be required to be withheld by Hospira in the U.S. Each Participant is responsible for compliance with the relevant legal and tax regulations in his or her tax jurisdiction.
 
Impact on Other Benefits
 
Any shares earned under this Program are not considered compensation for purposes of any retirement plan, severance arrangement or other benefit plans in which a Participant currently participates or may become eligible to participate in at a later date.
 
Forfeiture and Correction
 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this document to the contrary, if the Participant engages in any activity that constitutes restricted activity, including but not limited to: (1) competing, directly or indirectly (either as owner, employee or agent), with any of the businesses of the Company, (2) violating the Company code of business conduct, (3) committing an act of fraud, embezzlement or theft in the course of the Participant's duties or in the course of employment, (4) soliciting any present or future employees or customers of the Company to terminate such employment or business relationship(s) with the Company, (5) disclosing or misusing any confidential information regarding the Company, (such activities to be collectively referred to as "wrongful conduct"), then the
committee may at its sole discretion terminate this Award, to the extent it remains restricted, on the date on which the Participant engaged in such restricted activity, and (i) if the restricted activity occurred within one year of a PSU Vesting Date, the Participant shall pay to the Company in cash any financial gain the Participant realized from the vesting of the PSU, and (iii) if the misconduct occurs prior to the Deferred Payment Date, if applicable, the Participant shall forfeit the deferred PSU and this Award shall terminate automatically on the date on which the Participant first engaged in such wrongful conduct.
 
In addition, if the Participant is an officer required to file reports under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or is elected a corporate officer by Hospira's Board of Directors (not including assistant officers), the Participant is subject to the Company's Executive Compensation Recovery Policy ("Policy"). Subject to the terms of the Policy, and notwithstanding anything contained in this document to the contrary, if the number of PSUs to be delivered or the value of such PSUs was based on the Company's published financial statements that have been restated, then the Committee may within 60 months of such restatement: (1) cancel all PSUs (whether vested or unvested) that were based upon the financial performance in the published financial statements that was subsequently restated; (2) rescind any delivery of PSUs that were based upon the financial p erformance in the published financial statements that was subsequently restated; and (3) if any amount has been realized from the vesting of the PSUs that would have been lower had the financial results been properly reported, recover all or any financial gain realized by the Participant that resulted from the financial results that were subsequently restated.
 
For purposes of this section, financial gain shall equal, the fair market value of Hospira common stock on the Vesting Date, multiplied by the number of PSUs actually distributed pursuant to this Award, reduced by any taxes paid in countries other than the United States (which taxes are not otherwise eligible for refund from the taxing authorities). By accepting a PSU grant, the Participant consents to and authorizes the Company to deduct from any amounts payable by the Company to the Participant, any amounts the Participant owes to the Company under this section. This right of set-off is in addition to any other remedies the Company may have against the Participant for breach of the terms and conditions of this Program.
 
Administrative Guidelines
 
The following guidelines apply to the Program. Additional Administrative Guidelines may be adopted, as needed, during the Performance Cycle.
 
                 
The Committee is responsible for administering the Program and has full power and authority to interpret the Program and to adopt rules, regulations and guidelines for carrying out the Program, as it deems necessary.
 
                 
The Committee functions as the administrator of the Program and its decisions are binding on all persons.
 
                 
The Committee reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to reduce or eliminate the awards earned by any Participant and to make changes in the peer group and performance measurement methodology and any such changes shall be binding on all Participants.
 
                 
The Committee reserves the right to change any of the terms and conditions of the Program award to the Participants, including the definition of relative TSR, if deemed
 
necessary on advice of counsel to meet the requirements for a "performance-based exemption" under the regulations or rulings of 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to amend any of the terms and conditions of the Program award to Participants if deemed necessary in its sole discretion to comply with  409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
                 
The Committee may, as it deems appropriate, delegate some or all of its power to the CEO or other executive officer of the Corporation. However, the Committee may not delegate its power to a Program Participant concerning the grant, timing, pricing or amount of such Program Participant's award. The Incentive Award Committee of the Hospira Board of Directors shall have the authority to grant Performance Share Unit awards in accordance with the terms of this Program, except the Incentive Award Committee shall not make any such grants to any member of the Incentive Award Committee or officers required to file reports pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 pr ovided that no such individual award exceeds 200,000 performance shares.
 
                 
The Chief Financial Officer will be responsible for confirming the financial results under the Program. The Committee will approve the awards when granted during each fiscal year and approve distributions to be made at the end of the Performance Cycle for all Program Participants. The portion of the shares earned will be distributed as soon as practicable after the completion of the Performance Cycle and the Vesting Date.
 
                 
Awards may be made to new Participants during the first year of the Performance Cycle. The number of PSUs awarded may be adjusted to reflect that the individual is not a Participant for the entire Performance Cycle.
 
                 
Awards may be made to Participants who change positions during the first year of the Performance Cycle, if such a change would have resulted in the Participant's qualifying for an increased level of award.
 
                 
In the event of a Participant's death, Total Disability or if a Participant retires at age 55 or later and has at least 10 years of service with Hospira (or with Hospira and Abbott Laboratories if the Participant transitioned employment from Abbott to Hospira in conjunction with Hospira's spin-off from Abbott Laboratories or with an acquired company if service for that company has been recognized under the Program, all PSUs granted would continue to vest and be eligible for distribution at the end of the Performance Cycle based upon proration for performance only, subject to approval of the Committee. If applicable, this will be distributed at the normal payout time.
 
                 
A Participant who voluntarily resigns or is terminated without severance benefits during the Performance Cycle forfeits the rights to all PSUs and RSUs. Participants who are involuntarily terminated and receive severance benefits are eligible for a prorated distribution, subject to Committee approval. In order to be considered for any prorated distribution under this Program provision, a Participant must be actively employed for at least one-third, i.e. 12 months, of the Performance Cycle. Only periods of active service will be recognized for purposes of computing any prorated distribution. This means that any period of time during which services may be provided to the company but the individual is not then a regular, full-time employee of the company (for example, if the Participant provides services under a consulting agreement), that time will be disregarded for purposes of calculating any prorated distribution.
                 
In the event of a sale, closing, spin-off or other disposition of the Participant's business unit that results in the termination of the Participant's employment with the Company, the Participant will be eligible for a distribution of shares after the performance period pro-rated only for performance, subject to approval of the Committee.
 
                 
Should a change in control (as defined in the Plan) occur during the Performance Cycle, the Participant will be deemed to have earned an award based on the target performance goal and a number of shares of Hospira common stock equal to the number of such units earned (or cash equal to the value of the shares) will be delivered to the Participant no later than 90 days following the change in control.
 
                 
If any statement in this Program Description or any oral representation differs from the Plan or the Grant and Notice Agreement, the Plan and the Grant and Notice Agreement will prevail. The Plan, Grant Notice and Agreement and Program Description collectively comprise all terms and conditions applicable to the Program.
 
                 
Any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of securities, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, spin-off or other distribution of any or all of the assets of the Hospira will be handled as provided for in the Plan.
 
                 
Nothing in the Program shall confer on a Participant any right to continue in the employ of Hospira or in any way affect Hospira's right to terminate the Participant's employment in accordance with applicable laws.

Enclosure (4)
 
THIS AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), is made and entered into as of the                day of                    2011 (the "Effective Date") by and between Hospira, Inc. (the "Company") and                          (the "Executive").
 
WHEREAS, the Company considers it essential to the best interests of its shareholders to foster the continuous employment of key management personnel, and the Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, a change in control might occur and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management, including the Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, to induce the Executive to remain in the employ of the Company and in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants set forth herein, IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between the parties as follows:
 
1.     AGREEMENT TERM. THE TERM SHALL BEGIN ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE AND SHALL CONTINUE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2012. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF A CHANGE IN CONTROL (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 6 BELOW), OCCURS DURING THE AGREEMENT TERM, THE AGREEMENT TERM SHALL CONTINUE THROUGH AND TERMINATE ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE CHANGE IN CONTROL OCCURS.
 
2.     ENTITLEMENT TO CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFITS. The Executive shall be entitled to the Change in Control Benefits described in Section 3 hereof if the Executive's employment by the Company is terminated during the Agreement Term but after a Change in Control (i) by the Company for any reason other than Permanent Disability or Cause, or (ii) by the Executive for Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement:
 
(a)
                                 
A termination of the Executive's employment shall be treated as a termination by reason of "Permanent Disability" only if, due to a mental or physical disability, the Executive is absent from the full time performance of duties with the Company for a period of at least twelve consecutive months and fails to return to the full time performance of duties
 
within 30 days after receipt of a demand by the Company to do so.
(b)
                                
The term "Cause" shall mean the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, no act, or failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until the Company delivers to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth above and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
 
(c)
                                 
The term "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following circumstances without the Executive's express written consent:
 
(i)
                                    
a significant adverse change in the nature, scope or status of the Executive's position, authorities or duties from those in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, including, without limitation, if the Executive was, immediately prior to the Change in Control, an officer of a public company, the Executive ceasing to be an officer of a public company;
 
(ii)
                                 
the failure by the Company to pay the Executive any portion of the Executive's current compensation;
 
(iii)
                              
a reduction in the Executive's annual base salary (or a material change in the frequency of payment) as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control as the same may be increased from time to time;
 
(iv)
                             
the failure by the Company to award the Executive an annual bonus in any year which is at least equal to the annual bonus, awarded to the Executive under
 
the annual bonus plan of the Company for the year immediately preceding the year of the Change in Control;
(v)
                                
the failure by the Company to award the Executive equity-based incentive compensation (such as stock options, shares of restricted stock, or other equity-based compensation) on a periodic basis consistent with the Company's practices with respect to timing, value and terms prior to the Change in Control;
 
(vi)
                             
the failure by the Company to continue to provide the Executive with the welfare benefits, fringe benefits and perquisites enjoyed by the Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control under any of the Company's plans or policies, including, but not limited to, those plans and policies providing pension, life insurance, medical, dental, prescription, health and accident, disability, vacation,and other executive perquisites;
 
(vii)
                          
the relocation of the Company's principal executive offices to a location more than thirty-five miles from the location of such offices immediately prior to the Change in Control or the Company requiring the Executive to be based anywhere other than the Company's principal executive offices except for required travel to the Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with the Executive's business travel obligations immediately prior to the Change in Control; or
 
(viii)
                       
the failure of the Company to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to the Company to assume and agree to perform this Agreement as contemplated by Section 15.
 
For purposes of any determination regarding the existence of Good Reason, any good faith determination by the Executive that Good Reason exists shall be conclusive.
 
3.     CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFITS. In the event of a termination of employment entitling the Executive to benefits in accordance with Section 2, the Executive shall, subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of this Section 3, receive the following:
(a)
                                 
The Executive shall be entitled to receive the following employee welfare benefits: medical, health and accident, dental, prescription, disability, and life insurance coverage for the Executive (and, where applicable under the Company's welfare benefit plans, the Executive's family) through the third anniversary of the Executive's date of termination of employment, or, if earlier, the date on which the Executive becomes employed by another employer. The benefits provided by the Company shall be no less favorable in terms of coverage and cost to the Executive than those provided und er the Company's welfare benefit plans applicable to the Executive (and, where applicable, the Executive's family) prior to the Change in Control, determined as if the Executive remained in the employ of the Company through such third anniversary.
 
(b)
                                
If the Executive's date of termination occurs after the end of a performance period applicable to an annual incentive (bonus) award, and prior to the payment of the award for the period, the Executive shall be entitled to a lump sum payment in cash no later than twenty (20) business days after the date of termination equal to the greatest of (i) the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for that period, as determined under the terms of that incentive award arrangement, (ii) the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for that period, with the determination of the amount of such award based on an assumption that the target level of performance had been achieved or (iii) the Executive's average annual incentive (bonus) award for the three annual performance periods preceding that period (provided that if the Executive was not a participant in the incentive award arrangement for any of those three prior years, the averaging period shall be reduced from three years to the number of years during the three year period in which the Executive was a participant; and further provided that if the Executive's award for any such year was reduced because the Executive was not a participant for the full year, such amount shall be annualized for purposes of the computation in this clause (iii)).
 
(c)
                                 
For any annual incentive (bonus) plan or arrangement in which the Executive participates for the performance period in which the Executive's termination of employment occurs, the Executive shall be entitled to a lump sum payment in cash no later than twenty (20) business days after the date of termination equal to the greater of (i) the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for the performance period that
 
includes the date of termination, with the determination of the amount of such award based on an assumption that the target level of performance has been achieved or (ii) the Executive's average annual incentive (bonus) award for the three annual performance periods preceding the performance period that includes the date of termination  (provided that if the Executive was not a participant in the incentive award arrangement for any of those three prior years, the averaging period shall be reduced from three years to the number of years during the three year period in which the Executive was a participant; and further provided that if the Executive's award for any such year was reduced because the Executive was not a participant for the full year, such amount shall be annualized for purposes of the computation in this clause (ii)); provided that such payment shall be subject to a pro-ra ta reduction to reflect the number of days in the performance period following the date of termination. The amount payable under this paragraph (c) shall be in lieu of any amounts that may otherwise be due to the Executive with respect to any annual incentive (bonus) plan or arrangement in which the Executive participates for the performance period in which the Executive's date of termination occurs.
(d)
                                
The Executive shall be entitled to a lump sum payment in cash no later than twenty (20) business days after the Executive's date of termination equal to the sum of:
 
(i)
                                    
an amount equal to 2.99 times the Executive's annual salary rate in effect on the date of the Change in Control or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to the date of termination; plus
 
(ii)
                                 
an amount equal to 2.99 times the greater of (x) the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for the performance period that includes the date of the Executive's termination of employment, with the determination of the amount of such award based on an assumption that the target level of performance has been achieved or (y) the Executive's average annual incentive (bonus) award for the three annual performance periods preceding the performance period that includes the date of termination (provided that if the Executive was not a participant in the incentive award arran gement for any of those three prior years, the averaging period shall be reduced from three years to the number of years
 
during the three year period in which the Executive was a participant; and further provided that if the Executive's award for any such year was reduced because the Executive was not a participant for the full year, such amount shall be annualized for purposes of the computation in this clause (y)).
The amount payable under this paragraph (d) shall be inclusive of the amounts, if any, to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled as severance pay under any severance pay plan, or by law and shall be in addition to (and not inclusive of) any amount payable under any written agreement(s) directly between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
(e)
                                 
The Company shall provide the Executive with outplacement services suitable to the Executive's position through the third anniversary of the date of the Executive's termination of employment, or, if earlier, the date on which the Executive becomes employed by another employer.
 
If the Executive is a participant in the Hospira Performance Incentive Plan, the Hospira 2004 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, or any successor thereto, the Executive's annual incentive (bonus) award for the performance period which includes the date of termination under paragraphs (c) and (d)(ii) above and, if applicable, for the period preceding the date of termination under paragraph (b) shall, be determined under the bonus levels communicated in writing to the Executive by the Company for such year.
 
For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive is deemed a "key employee" within the meaning of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the regulations thereunder ("Specified Employee"). As a Specified Employee, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, any payments or benefits under Sections 3(b), (c) or (d) ("Restricted Payments") shall be provided to the Executive on the first day of the seventh month following the date of the Executive's termination of employment (the "Delay Period").  After the Delay Period, any Restricted Payments that constitute reimbursements to the Executive shall be made in accordance with their payment terms under this Agreement but no later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred.
 
4.     MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise. Except as set forth in paragraph 3(a) with respect to benefits, the Company shall not be entitled to set off against the amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement any amounts owed to the Company by the Executive, any amounts earned by the Executive in other employment after the Executive's termination of employment with
 
the Company, or any amounts which might have been earned by the Executive in other employment had the Executive sought such other employment.
5.     TERMINATION DURING POTENTIAL CHANGE IN CONTROL. If a Potential Change in Control (as defined in Section 7) occurs during the Agreement Term, and the Company terminates the Executive's employment for reasons other than Permanent Disability or Cause during such Potential Change in Control, the Executive shall be entitled to receive the benefits that the Executive would have received under Section 3, such benefits to be calculated based upon the Executive's compensation prior to the actual termination of employment but paid within 20 business days of the date of such termination.
 
6.     CHANGE IN CONTROL.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred on the earliest of a Change in Ownership, a Change in Effective Control, or a Change in Ownership of Assets, each as defined below.
 
(a)           Change in Ownership
 
(i)            In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(ii) of this Section, a Change in Ownership of the Company occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as defined in paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section), acquires ownership of the Company's stock that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Company's stock. However, if any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Company's stock, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a Change in Ownership of the Company (or to cause a Change in Effective Control of the Com pany (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this Section)). An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which the Company acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this Section. This paragraph (a)(i) applies only when there is a transfer of the Company's stock (or issuance of stock of the Company) and stock in the Company remains outstanding after the transaction.
 
(ii) Persons acting as a group. For purposes of paragraph (a)(i) above, persons will not be considered to be acting as a group solely because they purchase or own stock of the Company at the same time. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the Company. If a person, including an entity, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with
 
other shareholders only with respect to the ownership in that corporation before the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
(b)           Change in Effective Control
 
(i) In general. Notwithstanding that the Company has not undergone a Change in Ownership under paragraph (a) of this Section, a Change in Effective Control of the Company occurs only on either of the following dates:
 
(1) The date any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined under paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section), acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company possessing 30% or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company.
 
(2) The date a majority of members of the Company's board of directors is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company's board of directors before the date of the appointment or election.
 
(ii) Acquisition of additional control. If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control the Company (within the meaning of this paragraph (b)), the acquisition of additional control of the Company by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a Change in Effective Control of the Company (or to cause a Change in Ownership of the Company within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this Section).
 
(c)           Change in Ownership of Assets
 
(i)            In general. A Change in Ownership of Assets occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined in paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section), acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all of the Company's assets immediately before such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
 
(ii)           Transfers to a related personThere is no Change in Control event under this paragraph (c) when there is a transfer to an entity that is
 
controlled by the shareholders of the transferring corporation immediately after the transfer, as provided in this paragraph (c)(ii). A transfer of assets by the Company is not treated as a Change in Ownership of Assets if the assets are transferred to
(1) A shareholder of the Company (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock;
 
(2) An entity, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company;
 
(3) A person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Company; or
 
(4) An entity, at least 50% of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in paragraph (c)(ii)(3) above.
 
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(ii) and except as otherwise provided above, a person's status is determined immediately after the transfer of the assets.
 
(iii)          Persons acting as a group. Persons will not be considered to be acting as a group solely because they purchase assets of the Company at the same time. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of assets, or similar business transaction with the Company. If a person, including an entity shareholder, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of assets, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation only to the extent of the ownership in that corporation before the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
 
7.     POTENTIAL CHANGE IN CONTROL. A "Potential Change in Control" shall exist during any period in which the circumstances described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d), below, exist (provided, however, that a Potential Change in Control shall cease to exist not later than the occurrence of a Change in Control):
 
(a)

(b)
                                
Any Person (without regard to the exclusions set forth in subsections (i) through (iv) of such definition) publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking actions the consummation of which would constitute a Change in Control; provided that a Potential Change in Control described in this paragraph (b) shall cease to exist upon the withdrawal of such intention, or upon a determination by the Board that there is no reasonable chance that such actions would be consummated;
 
(c)
                                 
Any Person becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 10% or more of either the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company or the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities (not including in the securities beneficially owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its Affiliates);
 
(d)
                                
The Board adopts a resolution to the effect that, for purposes of this Agreement, a Potential Change in Control exists; provided that a Potential Change in Control described in this paragraph (d) shall cease to exist upon a determination by the Board that the reasons that gave rise to the resolution providing for the existence of a Potential Change in Control have expired or no longer exist.

9.     WITHHOLDING. All payments to the Executive under this Agreement will be subject to withholding of applicable taxes. The Company shall withhold the
 
applicable taxes in an amount calculated at the minimum statutory rate and shall pay the amount so withheld to the appropriate tax authority.

The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no succession had taken place.

Provisions contained in the agreements pertaining to nonforfeiture for death, disability, etc.
The parties to the Agreement Regarding Change in Control dated as of the      day of                    , 2011 (the "Agreement") recognize that a bona fide dispute as to certain matters may arise from time to time during the term of the Agreement which relates to either party's rights and/or obligations. To have such a dispute resolved by this Alternative Dispute Resolution ("ADR") provision, a party first must send written notice of the dispute to the other party for attempted resolution by good faith negotiations between the Executive and the Company within twenty-eight (28) days after such notice is received (all references to "days" in the ADR provision are to calendar days).
 
If the matter has not been resolved within twenty-eight (28) days of the notice of dispute, or if the parties fail to meet within such twenty-eight (28) days, either party may initiate an ADR proceeding as provided herein. The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel in such a proceeding.
 
1.             To begin an ADR proceeding, a party shall provide written notice to the other party of the issues to be resolved by ADR. Within fourteen (14) days after its receipt of such notice, the other party may, by written notice to the party initiating the ADR, add additional issues to be resolved within the same ADR.
 
2.             Within twenty-one (21) days following receipt of the original ADR notice, the parties shall select a mutually acceptable neutral to preside in the resolution of any disputes in this ADR proceeding. If the parties are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable neutral within such period, either party may request the President of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution ("CPR"), 366 Madison Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10017, to select a neutral pursuant to the following procedures:
 
(a)
                                 
The CPR shall submit to the parties a list of not less than five (5) candidates within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the request, along with a for each candidate.  No candidate shall be an employee, director or shareholder of either party or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.
Curriculum Vitae
 
(b)
                                
Such list shall include a statement of disclosure by each candidate of any circumstances likely to affect his or her impartiality.
 
(c)
                                 
Each party shall number the candidates in order of preference  (with the number one (1) signifying the greatest preference) and shall deliver the list to the CPR within seven (7) days following receipt of the list of candidates. If a party believes a conflict of interest exists regarding any of the candidates, that party shall provide a written explanation of the conflict to the CPR along with its list showing its order
of preference for the candidates. Any party failing to return a list of preferences on time shall be deemed to have no order of preference.
 
(d)
                                
If the parties collectively have identified fewer than three  (3) candidates deemed to have conflicts, the CPR immediately shall designate as the neutral the candidate for whom the parties collectively have indicated the greatest preference. If a tie should result between two candidates, the CPR may designate either candidate. If the parties collectively have identified three (3) or more candidates deemed to have conflicts, the CPR shall review the explanations regarding conflicts and, in its sole discretion, may either (i) immediately designate as the neutral the candidate for whom the parties collectively have indicated the greatest preference, or (ii) issue a new list of not less than five (5) candidates, in which case the procedures set forth in subparagraphs 2(a)-2(d) shall be repeated.
 
3.             No earlier than twenty-eight (28) days or later than fifty-six (56) days after selection, the neutral shall hold a hearing to resolve each of the issues identified by the parties. The ADR proceeding shall take place at a location agreed upon by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, the neutral shall designate a location other than the principal place of business of either party or any of the subsidiaries or affiliates.

a copy of all exhibits on which such party intends to rely in any oral or written presentation to the neutral;
 
(b)
                                
a list of any witnesses such party intends to call at the hearing, and a short summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness;
 
(c)
                                 
a proposed ruling on each issue to be resolved, together with a request for a specific damage award or other remedy for each issue. The proposed rulings and remedies shall not contain any recitation of the facts or any legal arguments and shall not exceed one (1) page per issue.
 
(d)
                                
a brief in support of such party's proposed rulings and remedies, provided that the brief shall not exceed twenty (20) pages. This page limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR proceeding. Except as expressly set forth in subparagraphs 4(a) - 4(d), no discovery shall be required or permitted by any means, including

5.             The hearing shall be conducted on two (2) consecutive days and shall be governed by the following rules:

Each party shall be entitled to five (5) hours of hearing time to present its case. The neutral shall determine whether each party has had the five (5) hours to which it is entitled.
 
(b)
                                
Each party shall be entitled, but not required, to make an opening statement, to present regular or rebuttal testimony, documents or other evidence, to cross-examine witnesses and to make a closing argument. Cross-examination of witnesses shall occur immediately after their direct testimony, and cross-examination time shall be charged against the party conducting the cross-examination.
 
(c)
                                 
The party initiating the ADR shall begin the hearing and, if it chooses to make an opening statement, shall address not only issues it raised, but also any issues raised by the responding party. The responding party, if it chooses to make an opening statement, also shall address all issues raised in the ADR. Thereafter, the presentation of regular and rebuttal testimony and documents, other evidence and closing arguments shall proceed in the same sequence.
 
(d)
                                
Except when testifying, witnesses shall be excluded from the hearing until closing arguments.
 
(e)
                                 
Settlement negotiations, including any statements made therein, shall not be admissible under any circumstances. Affidavits prepared for purposes of the ADR hearing also shall not be admissible. As to all other matters, the neutral shall have sole discretion regarding the admissibility of any evidence.
 
6.           Within seven (7) days following completion of the hearing, each party may submit to the other party and the neutral a post-hearing brief in support of its proposed rulings and remedies, provided that such brief shall not contain or discuss any new evidence and shall not exceed ten  (10) pages. This page limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR proceeding.
 
7.             The neutral shall rule on each disputed issue within fourteen (14) days following completion of the hearing. Such ruling shall adopt in its entirety the proposed ruling and remedy of one of the parties on each disputed issue but may adopt one party's proposed rulings and remedies on some issues and the other party's proposed
rulings and remedies on other issues. The neutral shall not issue any written opinion or otherwise explain the basis of the ruling.
 
8.             The neutral shall be paid a reasonable fee plus expenses by the Company. The Company shall bear its own fees and expenses. The Executive's fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed by the Company to the extent provided by the Agreement.
 
9.             The rulings of the neutral and the allocation of fees and expenses shall be binding, non-reviewable, and non-appealable, and may be entered as a final judgment in any court having jurisdiction.
 
10.           Except as provided in Section 9 or as required by law, the existence of the dispute, any settlement negotiations, the ADR hearing, any submissions (including exhibits, testimony, proposed rulings, and briefs), and the rulings shall be deemed Confidential Information. The neutral shall have the authority to impose sanctions for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information.
