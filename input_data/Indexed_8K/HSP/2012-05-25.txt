Item 5.04  Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
 
T. Rowe Price has been selected as the new recordkeeper under the Hospira 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, the Hospira Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan, and the Hospira Non-Qualified Savings and Investment Plan (collectively, the "Plan"), which will result in a blackout period with respect to participants' accounts in the Plan.  During the blackout period, transactions involving Hospira, Inc.'s ("Hospira") common stock under the Plan will not be permitted.  The blackout period is currently expected to begin at 3 p.m. Central Time on June 22, 2012 and end during the week of July 13, 2012.
 
On May 23, 2012, Hospira received the notice required by Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and, on that date, in accordance with Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, a notice was sent to Hospira's directors and executive officers informing them of the blackout period and certain trading restrictions in Hospira equity securities that will be imposed on directors and executive officers during the blackout period.  Such notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, includes the information required by Rule 104(b) of Regulation BTR, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
May 23, 2012
 
This notice is being sent to all executive officers and directors of Hospira in accordance with Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
This is to inform you that a new recordkeeper, T. Rowe Price, has been selected for the Hospira 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, the Hospira Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan, and the Hospira Non-Qualified Savings and Investment Plan (collectively, the "Plan").  As a result, the responsibility for keeping track of accounts in the Plan will transition from J. P. Morgan Retirement Plan Services to T. Rowe Price.
 
During this transition, Plan participants temporarily will be unable to engage in transactions involving the assets held in their Plan accounts, including transactions involving shares of Hospira common stock.  In addition, participants will not be able to obtain a loan, withdrawal or distribution from the Plan.  This period, during which participants will be unable to exercise these rights otherwise available under the Plan, is called a "blackout period."
 
Generally, during the blackout period, you are prohibited from directly or indirectly purchasing, selling or otherwise transferring any equity security of Hospira that you acquired in connection with your service or employment as a director or executive officer regardless of whether or not you are a participant in the Plan.  This prohibition includes the exercise of stock options.  In addition, covered transactions are not limited to those involving your direct ownership, but include any transactions in which you may have a pecuniary interest (e.g., transactions by members of your immediate family who share your household, as well as by certain entities in which you have financial involvement).
 
The blackout period is expected to begin at 3 p.m. Central Time on June 22, 2012 and end during the week of July 13, 2012
. You can determine whether the blackout period has started or ended by calling T. Rowe Price at 1-800-922-9945.
 
In addition to this Sarbanes-Oxley blackout, please remember that Hospira observes regularly scheduled blackout periods under its insider trading policy that restrict your ability to trade in Hospira stock.  For the second quarter, our insider trading blackout period will start on June 15, 2012 and is expected to end at the close of business on August 3, 2012.
 
The regulations do provide exceptions for a limited number of transactions.  However, the rules are complex and the criminal and civil penalties that could be imposed upon directors and executive officers who violate them could be severe.  Therefore, please contact Royce R. Bedward, Vice President, Deputy General Counsel & Secretary, before engaging in any transaction involving the Company's stock during the blackout period, if you believe that a transaction in which you have a pecuniary interest may occur during the blackout period or if you have any questions concerning this notice.
