Item 2.02               Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On August 1, 2012, Hospira, Inc. ("Hospira") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter 2012.  Such press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In the press release, Hospira uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others, net sales at constant currency, adjusted gross profit, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share.  These non-GAAP measures adjust for certain specified items that are described in the press release and attached schedules.  Hospira's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into Hospira's ongoing results of operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in financial planning to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance.  All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Item 9.01               Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
LAKE FOREST, Ill., Aug. 1, 2012  Hospira, Inc. (NYSE: HSP), the world's leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012. Net sales for the quarter were $1.0 billion, and adjusted* diluted earnings per share were $0.51. (Adjusted* measures exclude certain specified items as described later in this press release and the attached schedules.)
 
"Hospira's second-quarter results were in line with expectations," said F. Michael Ball, chief executive officer. "The quarter's performance reflected the impact of our quality-improvement initiatives, as well as a difficult comparison to strong second-quarter 2011 performance. During the quarter, we made progress with our remediation efforts and remain fully committed to reinforcing Hospira's foundation, which will allow us to better serve our customers and the patients who rely on our products. We believe that the initiatives we are taking this year will position Hospira with an even stronger competitive
advantage and create
sustainable, long-term shareholder value."
 
 
Second-Quarter 2012 Results
 
The following table highlights selected financial results for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011:
 
 
Results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) include items as detailed in the schedules attached to this press release.
 
Net sales were $1.0 billion in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of 3 percent compared to the second quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales were flat on a year-over-year basis. Higher volumes for certain Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical compounds outside the U.S. and favorable Medication Management sales were offset by
a difficult year-over-year comparison to strong second-quarter 2011 performance, driven primarily by strong U.S. sales of the oncolytic docetaxel and other
newer compounds, as well as the adverse impact to supply in 2012 of the company's
quality-improvement and remediation initiatives.
 
Adjusted* income from operations decreased 45 percent to $117 million in the second quarter of 2012. The majority of the decline reflects the impact of costs associated with higher year-over-year manufacturing expense and inventory losses. Additionally, operating costs increased in the second quarter of 2012 due to expected higher research and development spending, as well as higher selling and promotional costs.
 
The effective tax rate on an adjusted basis* in the quarter was 19.0 percent compared to 23.0 percent in the second quarter of 2011. The decrease is primarily due to lower operating income in higher-tax-rate jurisdictions.
 
Cash Flow
 
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2012 was $216 million compared to $253 million in the same period of 2011. The decrease primarily reflects lower net income in 2012, partially offset by lower investments in working capital in 2012, including inventory.
 
Capital expenditures were $137 million for the first six months of 2012, compared to $139 million for the same period in 2011.
 
2012 Projections
 
Hospira continues to project 2012 net sales to range between negative 1 to positive 2 percent on a constant-currency basis, with foreign exchange expected to detract from results by a negative 1 to negative 2 percent.
 
The company continues to believe that full-year 2012 adjusted* diluted earnings per share will be within the original projected range, but now expects full-year 2012 adjusted* diluted earnings per share to be at the low end of the range, approximately $2.00.
 
The reconciliation between the projected 2012 adjusted* diluted earnings per share and GAAP diluted earnings per share follows:
 
 
The adjusting items are shown net of tax in aggregate of $117 million, which is calculated for the specified adjustments stated above, based on the statutory tax rates in the various tax jurisdictions in which the items are expected to occur.
 
The company is revising its guidance for cash flow from operations, which is now projected to
range between $475 million and $525 million in 2012. The company continues to project that depreciation and amortization will range between $240 million and $260 million, and capital expenditures between $350 million and $400 million.

(1) 
The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release include comparisons at constant currency rates, which reflect comparative local currency balances at prior period foreign exchange rates.  Hospira calculated these percentages by taking current period reported net sales less the respective prior period reported net sales, divided by the prior period reported net sales, all at the respective prior period's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period.  Management believes the use of this measure aids in the understanding of our change in net sales without the impact of foreign currency and provides greater transparency into Hospira's results of operations.  Management uses these measures internally to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. These measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
