Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. On May 22, 2002, upon the recommendation of our Audit Committee, the Board of Directors dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP (Arthur Andersen) as our independent auditors and appointed KPMG LLP (KPMG) to serve as Host Marriott's independent auditors for the current fiscal year which ends on December 31, 2002. The change in auditors is effective May 22, 2002. Arthur Andersen's reports on our consolidated financial statements for each of the past two fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During each of our two most recent fiscal years and through the date of this report, there were: (i) no disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Arthur Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their report on our consolidated financial statements for such years; and (ii) no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. We have provided Arthur Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of Arthur Andersen's letter, dated May 16, 2002, stating its agreement with such statements. During each of our two most recent fiscal years and through the date of this report, we did not consult KPMG with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
