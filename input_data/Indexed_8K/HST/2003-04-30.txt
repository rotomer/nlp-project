HOST MARRIOTT REPORTS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FIRST QUARTER 2003
 
BETHESDA, MD; April 30, 2003  Host Marriott Corporation (NYSE: HMT), the nation's largest lodging real estate investment trust (REIT), today announced results of operations for the first quarter of 2003. The first quarter results reflect the difficult operating environment due to the war in Iraq and a generally weak economy that has resulted in reduced group and business travel. First quarter results include the following:
 
 
 
 
 
Comparative FFO and EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission rules and their use is discussed in more detail on page 4 of this release.
 
Operating Results
 
Comparable RevPAR for the first quarter declined 5.5% as a result of a 2.4% reduction in average room rate and an occupancy decline of 2.3 percentage points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel-level EBITDA margin decreased 3.8 percentage points and 3.9 percentage points, respectively.
 
Christopher J. Nassetta, president and chief executive officer, stated, "We are pleased we have been able to achieve results that were in accordance with our guidance for the first quarter despite the difficult operating environment that has been significantly impacted by the build up to, and the war in Iraq, the increased terror threat levels and the overall weak economy."
 
Balance Sheet
 
As of March 28, 2003, the Company had $313 million in cash on hand and $300 million of availability under its credit facility. The Company has no significant refinancing requirements until 2005 and does not believe that it will need to borrow under the credit facility in 2003.
 
W. Edward Walter, executive vice president and chief financial officer, stated, "Consistent with our financial strategy for the last 18 months, we will continue to maintain high cash reserves, which combined with limited debt maturities over the next two years, maximizes our financial flexibility in this challenging operating environment and positions us to be able to take advantage of opportunities that arise in the future."

The Company
 
Host Marriott Corporation, herein referred to as we or Host Marriott, is primarily the owner of hotel properties. We operate as a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT). We conduct our operations as an umbrella partnership REIT through an operating partnership, Host Marriott, L.P., or Host LP, of which we are the sole general partner. For each share of our common stock, Host LP has issued to us one unit of operating partnership interest, or OP Unit. When distinguishing between Host Marriott and Host LP, the primary difference is the 10% partnership interests of Host LP held by outside partners as of March 28, 2003, which is reflected as minority interest in our balance sheet and minority interest expense in our statement of operations. Readers are encouraged to find further detail regarding our organizational structure in our annual report on Form 10-K.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Included in this press release are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules that we believe are useful to investors. They are as follows: Comparative Funds From Operations, which we refer to as Comparative FFO, Earnings Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization and other non-cash items, or EBITDA, and comparable hotel-level results.
 
FFO and EBITDA
 
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be misleading or uninformative. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, adopted the definition of Funds From Operations, or FFO, in order to promote an industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance that would not have certain drawbacks associated with net income under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our definition of Comparative FFO is FFO adjusted for significant non-recurring items. We adjust FFO for the tax effect of significant non-recurring items such as the repurchase of the leasehold interests in 2000 and 2001 and tax refunds in 2002. We believe these adjustments to FFO allow our management to have a more accurate measure of our ongoing business for the purposes of budgeting and making decisions relating to future growth. We believe that the presentation of Comparative FFO provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it is a measure of our operating performance and our ability to fund capital expenditures and expand our business. In addition, the Compensation Policy Committee of the Board of Directors uses Comparative FFO as a measure of our performance in establishing criteria for compensation and in setting short-term and long-term performance goals for senior management.
 
Management believes that the presentation of EBITDA also provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because EBITDA is useful for evaluating our capacity to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and to expand our business. Specifically, our lenders and the rating agencies believe that EBITDA is a better measure of unleveraged cash flow that can be isolated by asset and is utilized to determine our ability to service debt and overall property performance. Restrictive covenants in our senior notes indenture and in our credit facility each contain financial ratios based on EBITDA. Management also uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like Comparative FFO, it is also widely used in our annual budget process. We remove non-cash items from EBITDA, which include compensation expense for our comprehensive stock plans, gains on acquisitions and dispositions, income (loss) from equity investments, purchase tax benefits and fair market value adjustments for foreign currency and derivatives.
 
However, Comparative FFO and EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets, interest expense (for EBITDA purposes only) and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the EBITDA and Comparative FFO presentations.

Comparable Hotel-Level Results
 
We define our comparable hotels as properties that are owned or leased, directly or indirectly, by us and for which we reported operating results throughout 2003 and 2002. We exclude from our comparable operating results hotels that have been acquired or sold during 2003 or 2002, or that have had substantial property damage or that have undergone large scale capital projects. We also exclude rental and other income from non-hotel properties and the results of our leased limited service hotels.
 
Our operating results for our comparable hotels include unaudited hotel-level EBITDA and the EBITDA margin for these properties. We believe that the comparable hotel-level results help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties and facilitate comparisons with other REITs and hotel owners. These measures assist management by providing a baseline to assess property-level results, particularly as we acquire or sell assets. While these measures are based on GAAP, costs such as depreciation, corporate expenses, adjustments for non-comparable reporting periods and other non-core revenues and expenses have been incurred by us and are not reflected in this presentation. As a result, the comparable hotel-level results do not represent our total revenues or operating profit.
 
Reporting Period
 
Our operating results are based on a calendar year ended December 31 as required by tax laws relating to REITs. However, our quarterly results are reported on a quarterly schedule that is used by Marriott International, the manager of the majority of our properties, whose year ends on the Friday closest to December 31 and which reflect twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters of the year and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year. Therefore, in any given quarter, quarter-over-quarter results will have different ending periods. For example, the first quarter of 2003 ended on March 28 and the first quarter of 2002 ended on March 22. As a result, during the first quarter of 2003, we included 87 days of operations, while for first quarter of 2002, we included 81 days of operations.
 
Approximately one-fourth of our full-service hotels have managers that have a different quarterly accounting calendar from us. For these hotels, which record revenues on a monthly basis versus our four week period, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect only two months of operations. We will record three months of operations for these hotels in each of the second and third quarters and four months of operations in the fourth quarter.
 
Our reported hotel operating statistics (RevPAR, average daily rate, average occupancy and hotel-level EBITDA margins) reflect the twelve weeks, or 84 days, ended March 28, 2003 and March 22, 2002 for our Marriott-managed hotels and two months of operations for our other managers in order to present these measures on a comparable basis.
