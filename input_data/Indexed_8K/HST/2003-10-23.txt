(i) Each significant subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X) of the Company has been duly organized and is validly existing as a limited liability company or limited partnership in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization;
 
and all of the issued equity interests of each such subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and (except for the OP Units) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause upon opinions of local counsel and in respect to matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state that they believe that both you and they are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates);
 
(ii) The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have good and marketable and insurable title to all real property owned by them, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects except such as are described in the Prospectus or such as do not materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries; and any real property and buildings held under lease by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not material and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property and buildings by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (in giving the opinion in this clause, such counsel may state that no examination of record titles for the purpose of such opinion has been made, and that they are relying upon a general review of the titles of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, upon opinions of local counsel and abstracts, reports and policies of title companies rendered or issued at or subsequent to the time of acquisition of such property by the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, upon opinions of counsel to the lessors of such property and, in respect to matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state that they believe that both you and they are justified in relying upon such opinions, abstracts, reports, policies and certificates);
 
(iii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, there is no legal or governmental proceeding, pending or threatened or against the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries, or their respective properties, which is required to be disclosed in the Prospectus and are not so described;
 
(iv) The issue and sale of the Shares by the Company and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not (i) conflict with or result in a breach or
 
violation of any of the respective charter or bylaws or other similar organizational instrument of any of the Company's subsidiaries, (ii) to such counsel's knowledge, result in the suspension, termination or revocation of any material Authorization (as defined below) of the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries or, (iii) constitute a default or cause an acceleration of any obligation under or result in the imposition or creation of (or the obligation to create or impose) a Lien with respect to, any bond, note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness or any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them is bound, or to which any properties of the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries is or may be subject or (iv) contravene any order of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties;

(vi) The documents incorporated by reference to the Prospectus and any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein and other financial and statistical data, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
(g) In addition, each of Latham & Watkins and Elizabeth A. Abdoo shall also confirm, in a separate letter, that subject to customary qualifications as to such counsel's participation, review and reliance, no facts came to such counsel's attention that caused such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein as of that date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of the Time of Delivery, together with the documents incorporated by reference
 
therein as of each such date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, it being understood that such counsel will express no belief with respect to the financial statements, schedules or other financial data included or incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the documents incorporated therein by reference.
 
(h) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement, at 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery, KPMG LLP shall have furnished to you a letter in the form set forth in Annex I hereto;
 
(i) Neither the Company nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' investment or results of operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Underwriter so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares being delivered at the Time of Delivery on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
 
(j) On or after the date hereof (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act; , such securities may be downgraded to B1 by Moody's Investors Service or B Standard & Poor's Ratings Services without creating a termination right under this Section 7(j), and (ii) other than the review for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service announced on August 06, 2003, no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;
provided, that
 
(k) On or after the date hereof there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial
 
banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Underwriter makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares being delivered at the Time of Delivery on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
 
(l) The Shares to be sold at the Time of Delivery shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the Exchange;
 
(m) The Company has obtained and delivered to the Underwriter executed copies of an agreement from each of the Company's executive officers, substantially to the effect set forth in Subsection 5(e) hereof in form and substance satisfactory to you; and
 
(n) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of the Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (h) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
 
8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use therein.
provided, however,
 
(b) The Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriter was treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(b) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriter under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Underwriter, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any controlling person of the Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
 
10. If for any reason, any Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the you in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
 
11. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriter shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Citigroup Capital Markets Inc., and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
12. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriter, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or the Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from the Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
13. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
 
14. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
15. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
16. The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) related to those benefits, without the Underwriter imposing any limitation of any kind.
 
17. If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us six counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Underwriter and the Company.

Dear Sirs:
 
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Host Marriott Corporation (the Company) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, and the related financial statement schedule, all of which are included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and incorporated by reference in the registration statement (no. 333-61722) on Form S-3 filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act); our report with respect thereto (which contains an explanatory paragraph that indicates that the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," on January 1, 2002, as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Company) is also incorporated by reference in that registration statement. The registration statement, as amended on October 21, 2003, is herein referred to as the "Registration Statement." Also, we have reviewed the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 12, 2003, June 20, 2003, March 28, 2003, September 6, 2002, June 14, 2002 and March 22, 2002 and for the thirteen-week periods ended March 28, 2003 and March 22, 2002, the thirteen-week and twenty six-week periods ended June 20, 2003 and June 14, 2002 and the thirteen-week and thirty nine-week periods ended September 12, 2003 and September 6, 2002.
 
In connection with the Registration Statement:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph.
 
Accordingly, we make no representations about the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.

The amount was recalculated for mathematical accuracy, where applicable.
 
Recalculated the percentage, ratio or amount and verified arithmetical accuracy from information in the aforementioned audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, and/or schedule or report prepared by the Company, and noted agreement.

We compared the information included under the heading "Selected Financial Data" with the requirements of item 301 of Regulation S-K. We also inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether this information conforms in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of item 301 of Regulation S-K. Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused us to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of item 301 of Regulation S-K.

It should be understood that our procedures with respect to the information contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) included in the Registration Statement were limited to applying the procedures stated above and therefore we make no representations regarding the accuracy of the discussions contained therein, whether any facts have been omitted, or regarding the adequacy of the disclosures in MD&A, other than with respect to the results of the procedures performed as described in the symbols above. However, we make no comment as to the appropriateness or completeness of the Company's determination of the Regulation S-K requirements for quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks or with respect to the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying the disclosures in item 7a of the Form 10-K and Item 3 of the Forms 10-Q, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk". Additionally, we make no comment as to the appropriateness or completeness of the Company's classification of its market risk-sensitive instruments into market risk categories as disclosed therein.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have served as Maryland counsel to Host Marriott Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection with certain matters of Maryland law arising out of the registration of 23,500,000 shares (the "Shares"), together with 23,500,000 Purchase Share Rights (as defined below), of the Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") to be issued and sold in an underwritten public offering covered by a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-61722), and all amendments thereto (collectively, the "Registration Statement"), filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). As used herein, "Purchase Share Rights" means the rights to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company, issued as a dividend to the holders of Common Stock, the terms of which are set forth in a Rights Agreement, dated as of November 23, 1998 (the "Rights Agreement"), as amended, between the Company (formerly known as HMC Merger Corporation) and The Bank of New York, as Rights Agent. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Registration Statement.
 
In connection with our representation of the Company, and as a basis for the opinion hereinafter set forth, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Documents"):

Host Marriott Corporation
6903 Rockledge Drive
Suite 1500
Bethesda, Maryland 20817
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This firm has acted as special tax counsel to Host Marriott Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("Host REIT"), in connection with issuance and sale of 23,500,000 shares of Host REIT's common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Shares"), as more fully described in Host REIT's prospectus supplement dated October 21, 2003 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), to Host REIT's prospectus dated January 9, 2002 (the "Prospectus") (the "Offering"). The Shares have been registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-61722) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Registration Statement"). You have asked us to provide to you this opinion for use in connection with an amendment to the Registration Statement that will be filed in connection with the Offering. Capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise defined in the body of this letter, shall have the meanings set forth in .
Appendix A
 
Bases for Opinion
 
The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury Regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which may or may not be retroactive in effect, that might result in material modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an

issue represents counsel's best professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS.

For purposes of rendering our opinion, although we have knowledge as to certain of the facts set forth in the above-referenced documents, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in such documents, including the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus and the Representation Letter. We consequently have relied upon the representations in the Representation Letter, the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement and assumed that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us is accurate and complete in all material respects. We are not aware, however, of any material facts or circumstances contrary to, or inconsistent with, the representations we have relied upon as described herein, or other assumptions set forth herein.
 
In this regard, we have assumed with your consent the following:
 
(i) that (A) all of the representations and statements set forth in the documents that we reviewed, including the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Representation Letter (collectively, the "Reviewed Documents"), are true, correct, and complete, (B) any representation or statement made as a belief or made "to the knowledge of" or similarly qualified is correct and accurate, and that such representation or statement will continue to be correct and accurate, without such qualification, (C) each of the Reviewed Documents that constitutes an agreement is valid and binding in accordance with its terms, and (D) all of the obligations imposed by or described in the Reviewed Documents, including, without limitation,
 
Host Marriott Corporation

the obligations imposed under the Articles of Incorporation, have been and will continue to be performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms; , notwithstanding any of the foregoing, we are not making any assumption as to the accuracy or completeness with respect to statements in the Tax Disclosure describing provisions of federal income tax law, which statements are covered by our opinion set forth below;
provided that
 
(ii) the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals of documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals from which any copies were made;
 
(iii) that any documents as to which we have reviewed only a form were or will be duly executed without material changes from the form reviewed by us;
 
(iv) that Crestline (A) is a duly incorporated and validly existing Maryland corporation; (B) has been, is and will continue to be, operated in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, its organizational documents, and statements made in the Prospectus (including the SEC filings incorporated therein by reference) and the Representation Letter; and (C) was formed, has operated and will continue to operate with a profit motive; and
 
(v) without limiting any other assumption described herein, that the representations of Crestline and the representations and covenants of Barcelo Empresarial and Merger Sub set forth in the Agreement and Consent and the Amendment to Agreement and Consent were true and correct on the date such representations were made, are true and correct on the date hereof and will remain true and correct.
 
Any material variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the documents that we have reviewed and upon which we have relied (including, in particular, the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, and the Representation Letter) may adversely affect the conclusions stated herein.

Opinion
 
Based upon, subject to, and limited by the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein (including those set forth below), we are of the opinion that:
 
(i) Host REIT was organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Code, effective for its taxable years ended December 31, 1999, December 31, 2000, December 31, 2001, and December 31, 2002, and Host REIT's current organization and intended method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for taxable year 2003 and thereafter;
 
(ii) The discussion in the Tax Disclosure, which discussion is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus Supplement, to the extent that it describes provisions of federal income tax law, is correct in all material respects.
 
 
Host REIT's ability to qualify as a REIT depends in particular upon whether each of the Leases is respected as a lease for federal income tax purposes. If one or more Leases are not respected as leases for federal income tax purposes, Host REIT may fail to qualify as a REIT. The determination of whether the Leases are leases for federal income tax purposes is highly dependent on specific facts and circumstances. In addition, for the rents payable under a Lease to qualify as "rents from real property" under the Code, the rental provisions of the Leases and the other terms thereof must conform with normal business practice and not be used as a means to base the rent paid on the income or profits of the lessees. In delivering the opinion set forth above that Host REIT's organization and method of operation (as described in the Representation Letter) have enabled Host REIT to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for its taxable years ended December 31, 1999, December 31, 2000, December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, and that Host REIT's current organization and intended method of operation will enable Host REIT to meet such requirements for the current taxable year and subsequent taxable years, we expressly rely upon, among other things, Host REIT's representations as to various factual matters with respect to the Leases, including representations as to the commercial reasonableness of the economic and other terms of the Leases at the times the Leases were originally entered into and subsequently renewed or extended (and taking into account for this purpose changes to the economic and other terms of the Leases pursuant to subsequent amendments), the intent and economic expectations of the parties to the Leases, the allocation of various economic risks between the parties to the Leases, taking into account all surrounding facts and circumstances, the conformity of the rental provisions and other terms of the Leases with normal business practice, the conduct of the parties to the Leases, and the conclusion that, except in connection with the
 
Host Marriott Corporation
October 22, 2003
Page 7
 
Harbor Beach Lease and any other leases that Host REIT acknowledges will not qualify as producing "rent from real property" under the Code, such terms are not being, and will not be, used as a means to base the rent paid on the income or profits of the lessees. We express no opinion as to any of the economic terms of the Leases, the commercial reasonableness thereof, or whether the actual economic relationships created thereby are such that the Leases will be respected for federal income tax purposes or whether the rental and other terms of the Leases conform with normal business practice (and are not being used as a means to base the rent paid on the income or profits of the Lessees).
 
Host REIT's ability to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year ended December 31, 1999 also depends upon Host REIT not having had as of December 31, 1999, any "earnings and profits" accumulated in any prior taxable year of Host REIT or any of its predecessors or subsidiaries (which would be based on the consolidated earnings and profits of Host REIT (including each of its predecessors) accumulated from 1929, the first year that a predecessor of Host REIT was a "C" corporation, through and including 1998). The calculation of "earnings and profits" depends upon a number of factual and legal interpretations related to the activities and operations of Host REIT's predecessors and their corporate affiliates during their entire corporate existence and is subject to review and challenge by the IRS. Host REIT has represented to us for purposes of our opinion that Host REIT distributed by the close of its taxable year ending December 31, 1999 any "earnings and profits" accumulated in any prior taxable year of Host REIT or any of its predecessors or subsidiaries. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will not examine the tax returns of Host REIT's predecessors and their affiliates for all years prior to 1999 and propose adjustments to increase their taxable income, which could result in Host REIT being considered to have had undistributed "earnings and profits" at the close of its taxable year ending December 31, 1999, in which event Host REIT would not qualify as a REIT for such year. We express no opinion as to Host REIT's current and accumulated "earnings and profits" or whether Host REIT will be considered to have had undistributed "earnings and profits" at the close of 1999.
 
Host REIT's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon Host REIT's ability to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, which are described (or incorporated by reference) in the Prospectus. We have relied upon representations of Host REIT and the Operating Partnership with respect to these matters (including those set
 
Host Marriott Corporation
October 22, 2003
Page 8
 
forth in the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, and the Representation Letter) and will not review Host REIT's compliance with these requirements on a continuing basis. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of Host REIT's operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements under the Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
