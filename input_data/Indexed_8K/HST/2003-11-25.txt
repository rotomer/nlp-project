ITEM 2.    ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
 
On November 13, 2003, Host Marriott Corporation, through its subsidiary Host Marriott, L.P., announced the closing on the acquisition of the 806-room Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa. The purchase price was $321 million or $398,000 per room, and was paid in cash. The acquisition was funded with the proceeds of Host Marriott Corporation's August 2003 and October 2003 equity offerings of 27.5 million and 23.5 million shares, respectively, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $501 million. The seller is an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. The acquisition is structured in a manner intended to qualify as part of a "reverse" like-kind exchange for tax purposes that will allow Host Marriott Corporation to defer the taxable gain on the disposition of other properties sold within 180 days of this acquisition.
 
A former director of Host Marriott Corporation, John G. Schreiber, is a co-founder of Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P., an affiliate of the Blackstone Group L.P., and as such is deemed to indirectly beneficially own approximately 2.5 million partnership units of Host Marriott L.P.
