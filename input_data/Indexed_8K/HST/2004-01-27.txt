ITEM 2.    ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
 
On November 13, 2003, Host Marriott Corporation, through its subsidiary Host Marriott, L.P., announced the closing on the acquisition of the 806-room Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa. The purchase price was $321 million or $398,000 per room, and was paid in cash. The acquisition was funded with the proceeds of Host Marriott Corporation's August 2003 and October 2003 equity offerings of 27.5 million and 23.5 million shares, respectively, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $501 million. The seller is an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. The acquisition is structured in a manner intended to qualify as part of a "reverse" like-kind exchange for tax purposes that will allow Host Marriott Corporation to defer the taxable gain on the disposition of other properties sold within 180 days of this acquisition.
 
A former director of Host Marriott Corporation, John G. Schreiber, is a co-founder and partner of Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P., an affiliate of the Blackstone Group L.P.

TO THE MEMBER OF HRM/BRE Maui LLC:
 
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of HRM/BRE Maui LLC (the "Company") as of December 31, 2001, and the related statements of income, changes in member's capital, and cash flows for the period March 28, 2001 (Commencement of Operations) to December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of HRM/BRE Maui LLC at December 31, 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period March 28, 2001 (Commencement of Operations) to December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

HRM/BRE Maui LLC (the "Company") was formed on January 16, 2001 as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of acquiring and owning a hotel built on approximately 36.6 acres of land known as The Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa (the "Property"), located in Lahaina, Hawaii. The Company was organized pursuant to the limited liability company agreement between BRE/Maui LLC ("Maui") and HT-Maui, Inc. ("HT"). The agreement was subsequently amended and restated (the "Agreement") in March 2001, at which time Maui and HT transferred their interests to HRM/BRE MM LLC ("MM"), as sole equity member, and to two individuals who were designated as special members, as defined.
 
The property, which was acquired by the Company on March 28, 2001 (the "Acquisition), consists of an 806-room Hyatt Regency Hotel (the "Hotel"). The Company acquired the Property for approximately $228.8 million, including acquisition costs. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired using their relative fair value at the date of acquisition. Accordingly, the initial valuations are subject to change as such information is finalized. The Company believes that any such change will not be significant based on valuations and other studies certain of which are not yet complete. The estimated fair value was $304.4 million for assets acquired, and the bargain purchase of approximately $75.6 million was allocated to write down the real estate acquired.
 
The Company shall continue unless dissolved pursuant to certain provisions of the Agreement.
 
The Agreement provides that the Company's profits and losses be allocated to MM. Distributions shall be made to MM at times and in aggregate amounts determined by the Board, as defined.
 
MM has collateralized a mezzanine note of $23,250,000 with its membership interest in the Company.
 
 
 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Basis of Presentation 
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
Restricted cash consists of cash held in escrow for the payment of furniture, fixtures and equipment, repairs and real estate taxes.
Restricted Cash 
 
Building and improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment are initially valued at acquisition based on their fair value as adjusted for the bargain purchase. Subsequent additions are recorded at cost. Building and improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over forty and five years respectively, using the straight-line method.
Real Estate 
 
In the event that facts or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the Property may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is prepared. In such an event, a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of the property. If such sum is less than the depreciated cost of the property, the property would be written down to its estimated fair value.
 
Inventories consist primarily of food and beverages which are stated at cost and determined by the first-in first-out (FIFO) method of accounting.
Inventories 
 
Deferred costs consist of financing fees which are being amortized under the straight-line method over the life of the related debt.
Deferred Costs 
 
Commercial rental revenue, consisting primarily of base rents, is generally recognized when due from tenants. There are no increases in rents over the lease terms in any of the tenants' leases. Room revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered; these are therefore recognized on a day-to-day basis. Revenue from the sale of food and beverage is recognized when the items have been delivered.
Revenue Recognition 
 
All financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying balance sheet at amounts which, in management's estimation are considered appropriate and reasonably approximate their fair values based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies. Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of the Company's financial instruments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring every derivative instrument to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The Statement requires that changes in the derivative instrument's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The Company has hedged the increase in interest rates on its mortgage loan payable with an interest rate cap agreement, which qualifies as a derivative instrument. The Company has not designated the derivative as a hedge and, accordingly has accounted for the interest rate cap at fair value on the balance sheet with the change in fair value since purchase of approximately $97, 804 being included in earnings in accordance with SFAS No. 133.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
 
SFAS No. 141, (effective July 1, 2001), prohibits pooling-of-interests accounting for acquisitions. The Company has accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting.
Business Combinations
 
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, , which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS 121, SFAS 144 is required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with certain early adoption permitted. SFAS No. 144 retains the requirements of SFAS No. 121 whereby an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value if the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows. The Company will be required to adopt this statement no later than January 1, 2002 and management believes that it will not alter the timing nor magnitude of future impairment losses, if any, that would be recognized under the pre SFAS No. 144 authoritative accounting literature.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.
 
The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company are recorded on the financial statements of HRM/BRE MM2 LLC, of which MM is a wholly-owned subsidiary, for federal income tax purposes. The Company and MM are single member limited liability companies which are disregarded for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, income taxes have not been provided for in the accompanying financial statements.
Income Taxes 
 
 
Due from affiliate consists of amounts due to the Company by Maui in connection with the Acquisition.
 
 
On March 28, 2001, the Company obtained third-party financing in the amount of $146,750,000. The mortgage loan requires the payment of interest only in monthly installments through the maturity date of April 9, 2004, at which time the principal and
 
 
accrued interest are due in full. The loan bears interest at LIBOR (approximately 1.95% at December 31, 2001), as defined, plus a margin of 1.84148% per annum.
 
The Company has the option to extend the maturity date for two one-year periods. The loan is secured by a deed of trust on the Property.
 
In March 2001, the Company entered into a fixed interest rate cap agreement to limit the impact of increases in interest rates on the loan. At December 31, 2001, the interest rate cap has effectively limited the Company's interest rate exposure on the $146,750,000 mortgage loan to a maximum rate of 7.50% per annum. The interest rate cap agreement expires on April 15, 2004.
 
The cost of obtaining the cap has been capitalized and adjusted to fair value at December 31, 2001 in accordance with SFAS No. 133. (See Note 2).
 
The interest rate cap agreement was entered into with a major financial institution, which is expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement thereby reducing the risk from the transaction.
 
 
Due to affiliates consists primarily of certain closing costs paid by an affiliate of Maui on behalf of the Company, and amounts owed to an affiliate of HT for hotel management fees.
 
 
The Company leases space to tenants for varying terms for which minimum annual rents are received. The leases require fixed monthly payments over the terms of the leases and additional rents based on a percentage of tenants' sales, as defined. Future minimum rents to be received from existing tenants under noncancelable operating leases at December 31, 2001 approximate the following:
 
 
 
The Hotel is managed by Hyatt Corporation ("Hyatt"), an affiliate of HT under an agreement which expires in December 2036. Hyatt receives a hotel management fee of 3.3% of gross receipts, as defined. Hyatt is also entitled to an incentive management fee equal to 10% of that portion of Profit, as defined, exceeding $25.5 million. Hotel management fees of $2.1
 
 
million were incurred by the Company for the period from March 28, 2001 to December 31, 2001. No incentive management fees were incurred during the period from March 28, 2001 to December 31, 2001.
 
 
The Company is involved from time to time in litigation arising in the normal course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

The unaudited pro forma financial information of Host Marriott Corporation set forth below is based on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 12, 2003 ("First Three Quarters 2003") and the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002.
 
All of the transactions below, except for the resolution of outstanding issues on the New York Marriott World Trade Center and Financial Center hotels, the application of the proceeds therefrom, the partial repayments of mortgages on two Ritz-Carlton properties and four Canadian properties, acquisition of the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa, sale of the Jacksonville Marriott, Williamsburg Marriott, Oklahoma City Marriott and the Plaza San Antonio Marriott, offering of Series J senior notes, the application of the proceeds therefrom, and issuance of 23.5 million common shares, the change in the application of the provisions of SFAS 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," are already reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 12, 2003 and therefore, no pro forma adjustments for these transactions were necessary in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet.
 
Our unaudited pro forma statements of operations reflect the transactions described below for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the First Three Quarters 2003 as if those transactions had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented. Our unaudited pro forma statements of operations which we present below include only income (loss) from continuing operations.
 
The pro forma financial statements reflect the following transactions:
 
2004 Transactions:
 
 
2003 Transactions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2002 Transactions:
 
 
 
Our unaudited pro forma financial statements do not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would actually have been if these transactions had in fact occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, or to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period.
 
Our unaudited pro forma financial statements are based upon available information and upon assumptions and estimates, some of which are set forth in the notes to the unaudited pro forma financial statements, that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K. The audited consolidated financial statements filed on Form 10-K were restated in December 2003 as a result of the adoption of two new accounting standards, SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," and SFAS No. 145, "Recission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 46, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." The restated financial statements were filed on Form 8-K on December 10, 2003.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prior to FSP 150-3, the FASB's guidance required issuers whose financial statements include consolidated ventures with finite lives to reflect any minority interests in such consolidated ventures as a liability on the issuer's financials statements presented at its fair value as of the applicable balance sheet date. Any fluctuations in the fair value of the minority interest from period to period would be recorded on the issuer's financial statements as interest expense for the change in the fair value of the liability. As a result, we recorded a loss from a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $24 million and included in our liabilities as of September 12, 2003, minority interests with a fair value of $112 million.
