Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The Company
 
Host Marriott Corporation, herein referred to as "we" or "Host Marriott," is a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns primarily hotel properties. We conduct our operations as an umbrella partnership REIT through an operating partnership, Host Marriott, L.P., or Host LP, of which we are the sole general partner. For each share of our common stock, Host LP has issued to us one unit of operating partnership interest, or OP Unit. When distinguishing between Host Marriott and Host LP, the primary difference is the 7% of the partnership interests in Host LP held by outside partners as of December 31, 2003, which is reflected as minority interest in our balance sheets and minority interest expense in our statements of operations. Readers are encouraged to find further detail regarding our organizational structure in our annual report on Form 10-K.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On November 7, 2003, the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position (FSP) 150-3 indefinitely deferring the application of a portion of SFAS 150 with respect to minority interests in consolidated ventures entered into prior to November 5, 2003 effectively reversing its guidance of October 8, 2003. In accordance with FSP 150-3, we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle reversing the impact of our adoption of SFAS 150 with respect to consolidated ventures with finite lives in the fourth quarter of 2003.
