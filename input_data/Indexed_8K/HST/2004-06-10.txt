(ii) The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have good and marketable and insurable title to all real property owned by them, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects except such as are described in the Prospectus or such as do not materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries; and any real property and buildings held under lease by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not material and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property and buildings by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (in giving the opinion in this clause, such counsel may state that no examination of record titles for the purpose of such opinion has been made, and that they are relying upon a general review of the titles of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, upon opinions of local counsel and abstracts, reports and policies of title companies rendered or issued at or subsequent to the time of acquisition of such property by the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, upon opinions of counsel to the lessors of such property and, in respect to matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state that they believe that both you and they are justified in relying upon such opinions, abstracts, reports, policies and certificates);
(iii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, there is no legal or governmental proceeding, pending or threatened in writing or against the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries, or their respective properties, which is required to be disclosed in the Prospectus and are not so described;
 
(iv) The execution and delivery of the Shares by the Company, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement (including the issuance and sale of the Shares to the Underwriters) will not (a) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the respective charter or bylaws or other similar organizational instrument of any of the Company's subsidiaries, (b) to such counsel's knowledge, result in the suspension, termination or revocation of any material Authorization (as defined below) of the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries or, (c) constitute a default or cause an acceleration of any obligation under or result in the imposition or creation of (or the obligation to create or impose) a Lien with respect to, any bond, note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness or any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them is bound, or to which any properties of the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries is or may be subject or (d) contravene any order of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties;

(vi) The documents incorporated by reference to the Prospectus and any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Closing Date (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein and other financial and statistical data, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
(g) In addition, each of Latham & Watkins and Elizabeth A. Abdoo shall also confirm, in a separate letter, that subject to customary qualifications as to such counsel's participation, review and reliance, no facts came to such counsel's attention that caused such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein as of that date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of such Closing Date, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein as of each such date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, it being understood that such counsel will express no belief with respect to the financial statements, schedules or other financial data included or incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the documents incorporated therein by reference.
 
(h) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement and at 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at such Closing Date, KPMG LLP shall have furnished to you a letter in the form heretofore agreed upon;
 
(i) Neither the Company nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' investment or results of operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Underwriters so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares being delivered at on such Closing Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
 
(j) On or after the date hereof (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act; , such securities may be downgraded to B1 by Moody's Investors Service or B by

(l) The Shares to be sold at such Closing Date shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the Exchange;

8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, members, directors and officers and each person who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and will reimburse the Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use therein.
provided, however,
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), each Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or any controlling person of the Underwriters, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
 
10. If for any reason, any Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the you in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
 
11. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013 and to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., 60 Wall Street, 10
th
Floor, New York, New York 10005, and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
12. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or the Underwriters, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from the Underwriters shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
13. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.
 
14.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
15. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
16. If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us six counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Underwriters and the Company.

As used herein, "Purchase Share Rights" means the rights to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company, issued as a dividend to the holders of Common Stock, the terms of which are set forth in a Rights Agreement, dated as of November 23, 1998 (the "Rights Agreement"), as amended, between the Company (formerly known as HMC Merger Corporation) and The Bank of New York, as Rights Agent. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Registration Statement.
 
In connection with our representation of the Company, and as a basis for the opinion hereinafter set forth, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Documents"):
 
1. The Registration Statement, including the related form of Prospectus included therein, dated April 19, 2004 (the "Base Prospectus"), and the Prospectus Supplement, dated June 9, 2004 (the "Prospectus Supplement" and, together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"), in the form in which they were or will be transmitted to the Commission under the 1933 Act;

4. All Documents submitted to us as originals are authentic. The form and content of all Documents submitted to us as unexecuted drafts do not differ in any respect relevant to this opinion from the form and content of such Documents as executed and delivered. All Documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original documents. All signatures on all such Documents are genuine.

2. The Shares have been duly authorized and, when and to the extent issued and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to the Resolutions, the Charter and the Registration Statement, the Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
3. The Purchase Share Rights have been duly authorized and, when issued in accordance with the Resolutions, the Charter and the Rights Agreement, will be validly issued.
 
The foregoing opinion is limited to the substantive laws of the State of Maryland and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. We express no opinion as to the applicability or effect of any federal or state tax or securities laws, including the securities laws of the State of Maryland, or as to federal or state laws regarding fraudulent transfers. To the extent that any matter as to which our opinion is expressed herein would be governed by any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland, we do not express any opinion on such matter. The
