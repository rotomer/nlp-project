HOST MARRIOTT REPORTS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR SECOND QUARTER 2004
 
BETHESDA, MD; July 21, 2004  Host Marriott Corporation (NYSE: HMT), the nation's largest lodging real estate investment trust (REIT), today announced results of operations for the second quarter of 2004. Second quarter results include the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). See the discussion included in this press release for information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 8.8% as compared to the second quarter of 2003, driven by an increase in occupancy of 5.3 percentage points and a 1.1% increase in average room rate. Comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the second quarter increased 60 basis points. Year-to-date, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.0% and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins increased 10 basis points.
 
Christopher J. Nassetta, president and chief executive officer, stated, "Strengthening demand has accelerated our RevPAR growth, leading to earnings results which exceeded our expectations. Our leading indicators continue to suggest we are in the early stages of a strong recovery, and that we should continue to see positive results throughout the remainder of the year and into 2005."

Financing Transactions and Balance Sheet
 
During the second quarter, the Company completed several financing transactions, including:
 
 
 
 
As of June 18, 2004, the Company had $771 million of cash and cash equivalents and $250 million of availability under its credit facility. After taking into consideration the acquisition of Fairmont Kea Lani and the redemption of the Class A preferred stock, the Company will have a cash balance of approximately $300 million.
 
W. Edward Walter, executive vice president and chief financial officer, stated, "Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet through debt reduction and refinancing, along with the strategic deployment of our capital, have positioned us well to take advantage of opportunities in the lodging market. We will continue to look at opportunities in the capital markets that will increase our flexibility and lower our financing costs."
 
Acquisitions and Dispositions
 
On July 15, 2004, the Company acquired the 450-suite Fairmont Kea Lani Maui, a premier luxury resort hotel located on 21 acres of Wailea's Polo Beach for $355 million. The Company also completed the sale of the Dallas/Fort Worth Marriott for $59 million in the second quarter.
 
James F. Risoleo, executive vice president, acquisitions and development stated, "We are pleased with the acquisition of the Fairmont Kea Lani Maui. In addition to expanding our portfolio of resorts, this hotel benefits from extremely high barriers to entry for new supply and represents the Company's first Fairmont-branded hotel. It will be the Company's second property in Hawaii, a market that we believe should continue to perform well. We are continuing to pursue additional acquisitions that are consistent with our target profile of upscale and luxury properties in markets with significant barriers to entry, while seeking to dispose of non-core assets to recycle our capital and build on our truly unmatched portfolio of properties."

2004 Outlook
 
The Company expects comparable hotel RevPAR for the third quarter of 2004 and full year 2004 to increase approximately 6.0% to 8.0% and 5.5% to 7.0%, respectively. This reflects an increase from the Company's 2004 RevPAR guidance issued on April 28, 2004. Based upon this revised guidance, the Company estimates that for 2004 its:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company indicated that it will continue to pay its quarterly dividends on its preferred stock. In addition, the Company expects to pay a $.04 to $.06 per share dividend on its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2004, representing the final distribution of 2003 taxable income. Assuming continued improvement in operations in 2005 and a corresponding growth in taxable income, the Company intends to reinstate a quarterly dividend on its common stock in the $.04 to $.06 per share range beginning with the first quarter of 2005, which will be payable on or about April 15, 2005. Assuming further continued improvement in the Company's operations, the Company believes its taxable income and hence its common dividend has the potential to grow substantially in subsequent years.
 
Host Marriott is a Fortune 500 lodging real estate company that currently owns or holds controlling interests in 112 upscale and luxury hotel properties primarily operated under premium brands, such as Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt, Four Seasons, Fairmont, Hilton and Westin.

The Company
 
Host Marriott Corporation, herein referred to as "we" or "Host Marriott," is a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns primarily hotel properties. We conduct our operations as an umbrella partnership REIT through an operating partnership, Host Marriott, L.P., or Host LP, of which we are the sole general partner. For each share of our common stock, Host LP has issued to us one unit of operating partnership interest, or OP Unit. When distinguishing between Host Marriott and Host LP, the primary difference is the 6% of the partnership interests in Host LP held by outside partners as of July 15, 2004, which is reflected as minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets and minority interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Readers are encouraged to find further detail regarding our organizational structure in our annual report on Form 10-K.
 
Reporting Periods for Hotel Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results
 
The results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers. Our hotel managers use different reporting periods. Marriott International, Inc., the manager of the majority of our properties, uses a fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to December 31 and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its Marriott-managed hotels. In contrast, other managers of our hotels, such as Hyatt, report results on a monthly basis. Host Marriott, as a REIT, is required by tax laws to report results on a calendar year. As a result, we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by Marriott International modified so that our fiscal year always ends on December 31 to comply with REIT rules. Our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as Marriott International but our fourth quarter ends on December 31.
 
Two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are: (1) quarterly start dates will usually differ between years, except for the first quarter which always commences on January 1, and (2) our first and fourth quarters of operations and year-to-date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years. For example, the second quarter of 2004 ended on June 18, and the second quarter of 2003 ended on June 20, though both quarters reflect twelve weeks of operations. However, the June 18, 2004 year-to-date operations include 170 days of operations, while the June 20, 2003 year-to-date operations include 171 days of operations.
 
In addition, for results reported by hotel managers using a monthly reporting period (approximately one-fourth of our full-service hotels), the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter-end is included in our results of operations in the following fiscal quarter. Accordingly, our results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows: first quarter (January, February), second quarter (March to May), third quarter (June to August), and fourth quarter (September to December). The year-to-date 2004 operations include 152 days of operations for our monthly hotels compared to 151 days of operations for the year-to-date 2003 operations.
 
In contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statements of operations, our hotel operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and our comparable hotel results (comparable hotel revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit) are always reported based on the reporting cycle used by Marriott International for our Marriott-managed hotels. This facilitates year-to-year comparisons, as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year (except in the case of certain of our fourth quarters which are comprised of seventeen weeks, such as fiscal year 2002). This means, however, that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics may differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our consolidated statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year. For the hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein:

Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics
 
We present certain operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis. We define our comparable hotels as full-service properties (i) that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations, for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared, and (ii) that have not sustained substantial property damage or undergone large-scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared. For 2004 and 2003, we consider 107 of our portfolio of 111 full-service hotels owned on June 18, 2004 to be comparable hotels. The operating results of the following four hotels that we owned as of June 18, 2004 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the operating results of the 15 hotels we disposed of in 2004 and 2003 are also not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein. Moreover, because these statistics and operating results are for our full-service hotel properties, they exclude results for our non-hotel properties and leased limited-service hotels.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Included in this press release are certain "non-GAAP financial measures," which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) Funds From Operations (FFO) per diluted share, (ii) EBITDA, (iii) Adjusted EBITDA and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Results. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.
 
FFO per Diluted Share
 
We present FFO per diluted share as a non-GAAP measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate FFO per diluted share for a given operating period as our FFO (defined as set forth below) for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We present FFO on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities, including the payment of preferred stock dividends, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines.
 
Table of Contents
 
We believe that FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its April 2002 "White Paper on Funds From Operations," since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the definition of FFO in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.
 
EBITDA
 
Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process.
 
Adjusted EBITDA
 
Management has historically adjusted EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional recurring and non-recurring items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We adjust EBITDA for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA:

Limitations on the Use of FFO per Diluted Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
 
We calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may also not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA purposes only) and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, FFO per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, FFO per diluted share does not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to shareholders' benefit.
 
Comparable Hotel Operating Results
 
We present certain operating results for our full-service hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit, on a comparable hotel, or "same store," basis as supplemental information for investor's information. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for full-service hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions, significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods. We present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate-level costs and expenses related to our capital structure, as well as depreciation and amortization. We eliminate corporate-level costs and expenses to arrive at property-level results because we believe property-level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management in running our business on a property-level basis. We eliminate depreciation and amortization because, even though depreciation and amortization are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.
 
As a result of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses or operating profit and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.
 
Table of Contents
 
We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a "same store" supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating the ongoing performance of the Company, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results. For these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46, which we refer to as FIN 46R. Under FIN 46R, we are not the primary beneficiary and we are required to deconsolidate the accounts of the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust. We adopted the provisions of FIN 46R on January 1, 2004. As a result, we recorded the $492 million in debentures (the Convertible Subordinated Debentures) issued by the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust and eliminated the $475 million of Convertible Preferred Securities that were previously classified in the mezzanine section of our consolidated balance sheet prior to January 1, 2004. The difference of $17 million is our investment in the Convertible Preferred Securities Trust, which is included in "Investments in affiliates" on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we classified the related dividend payment of approximately $15 million as interest expense. The adoption of FIN 46R had no effect on our net loss, loss per diluted share or financial covenants under our senior notes indentures.
