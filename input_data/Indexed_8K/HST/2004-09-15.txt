Host Marriott Corporation ("Host Marriott") announced today that Host Marriott, L.P. ("Host LP"), for whom Host Marriott acts as sole general partner, has entered into an amended and restated credit facility. The terms "we" or "our" refer to Host Marriott and Host LP together, unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
See discussion of the amended and restated bank credit facility set forth below in Item 2.03 which is incorporated herein.
 
 
General
 
On September 10, 2004, we entered into an amended and restated credit facility with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Citicorp North America Inc., Socit Gnrale and Calyon New York Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents and certain other lenders. The amended and restated credit facility replaces our prior credit facility and provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of $575 million. The amended and restated credit facility also includes subcommitments for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $10 million and loans to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in Canadian Dollars in an aggregate amount of $150 million. The amended and restated credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity in September 2008. We have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met at the time of the initial scheduled maturity. We also have the option to increase the amount of the facility by up to $100 million to the extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the credit facility, commits to be a lender for such amount.
 
As with the prior facility, the debt under the amended and restated credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and is currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture, certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the amended and restated credit facility. As with the prior facility, the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters.
 
We have not made any drawings under the credit facility.
 
Financial Covenants and Dual Tranche Structure
 
 
Unlike our prior facility, the revolving loan commitment under the amended and restated credit facility is divided into two separate tranches: (1) a Revolving Facility A tranche of $385 million and (2) a Revolving Facility B tranche of $190 million. Subject to compliance with the facility's financial covenants, amounts available for borrowing under Revolving Facility A vary depending on our leverage ratio, with $385 million being available when our leverage ratio is less than 6.5x, $300 million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 6.5x but is less than 6.75x, $150 million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 6.75x but is less than 7.0x, and no amounts being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x. By contrast, the entire amount of Revolving Facility B is available for borrowing at any time that our leverage ratio does not exceed levels ranging from 7.5x to 7.0x (depending on the time period as further described below) and our unsecured interest coverage ratio equals or exceeds 1.5x.
 
We are subject to different financial covenants depending on whether amounts are borrowed under Revolving Facility A or Revolving Facility B, and we are permitted to convert amounts borrowed under either tranche into amounts borrowed under the other tranche. While the financial covenants applicable under Revolving Facility A are generally comparable to those contained in our prior facility (including covenants for leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage), the financial covenants applicable to Revolving Facility B are limited to leverage and unsecured interest coverage, and are set at less restrictive levels than the corresponding covenants applicable to Revolving Facility A. As a result of this structure, we have gained flexibility to make and maintain borrowings in circumstances where adverse changes to our financial condition could have prohibited the
 
maintenance of borrowings under the prior facility. Specifically, prior to the end of our third quarter of 2007, we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under Revolving Facility B so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.5x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.5x. Thereafter, the maximum leverage ratio applicable to Revolving Facility B is reduced to 7.25x, with a further reduction to 7.0x occurring at the end of our third quarter of 2008. The financial covenants for the Revolving Facility A and Revolving Facility B do not apply when there are no borrowings under the respective tranche. Hence, so long as there are no amounts outstanding we are not in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the amended and restated credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants.
 
Interest and Fees
 
We pay interest on borrowings under the Revolving Facility A at floating interest rates plus a margin (which, in the case of LIBOR-based borrowings, ranges from 2.00% to 3.00%) that is set with reference to our leverage ratio. Borrowings under Revolving Facility B are subject to a margin that is .5% higher than the corresponding margin applicable to Revolving Facility A borrowings and .75% higher when our leverage ratio is greater than 7.0x. As with the prior facility, to the extent that amounts under the amended and restated credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment.
 
Other Covenants and Events of Acceleration
 
Our amended and restated credit facility imposes restrictions on customary matters that were also restricted in our prior facility. While such restrictions are generally similar to those contained in our prior facility, we have modified certain covenants to become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x. In particular, at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments and dividends contained in the amended and restated credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture.
 
As with the prior facility, the amended and restated credit facility reflects restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends that are generally consistent with the senior notes indenture. These provisions, under certain circumstances, limit debt incurrence to that incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain Host Marriott's tax status as a REIT.
 
Also as with the prior facility, the amended and restated credit facility includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the credit facility may be accelerated, the lenders' commitments may be terminated and the lenders may foreclose on the collateral. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the credit facility will automatically become due and payable and the lenders' commitments will automatically terminate.
 
Existing Relationships with the Lenders
 
We have ongoing relationships with all of the lenders that are parties to the amended and restated credit facility for which they have received customary fees and expenses. Certain of the lenders provide commercial banking services, including participations in mortgage loans and the provision of cash management services. We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements and other hedging arrangements with certain lenders. Affiliates of certain of the lenders have also acted as underwriters for issuances of our senior notes and equity securities. The Bank of New York also acts as trustee for our senior notes.

Special Provisions Regarding RL Lenders and Canadian Revolving Loans
 
(a) On the fifth Business Day after the occurrence of a Sharing Event, automatically (and without the taking of any action) (x) all then outstanding Canadian Revolving Loans of a Tranche shall be automatically converted into Dollar Revolving Loans of such Tranche (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount or Face Amount, as the case may be, of the respective Canadian Revolving Loans of such Tranche on the date such Sharing Event first occurred, which Dollar Revolving Loans shall be owed by the
 
respective Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower, shall thereafter be deemed to be Base Rate Loans and shall be immediately due and payable on the date such Sharing Event has occurred) and (y) all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts owing with respect to such Canadian Revolving Loans shall be immediately due and payable in Dollars, taking the Dollar Equivalent of such accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts. The occurrence of any conversion as provided above in this Section 2.17(a) shall be deemed to constitute, for purposes of Section 2.12, a prepayment of the respective Canadian Revolving Loans before the last day of any Interest Period relating thereto.
 
(b) Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event, each RL Lender shall (and hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to) purchase and sell (in each case in Dollars) undivided participating interests in the Revolving Loans of outstanding Tranches to, and any Unpaid Drawings of such Tranches owing by, each Borrower in such amounts so that each RL Lender shall have a share of the outstanding Revolving Loans of each Tranche and Unpaid Drawings of each Tranche then owing by each Borrower equal to its RL Percentage thereof. Upon any such occurrence the Administrative Agent shall notify each RL Lender and shall specify the amount of Dollars required from such RL Lender in order to effect the purchases and sales by the various RL Lenders of participating interests in the amounts required above (together with accrued interest with respect to the period from the last interest payment date through the date of the Sharing Event plus any additional amounts payable by any respective Borrower pursuant to Section 5.04 in respect of such accrued but unpaid interest); that in the event that a Sharing Event shall have occurred, each RL Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, automatically and without request, such participating interests. Promptly upon receipt of such request, each RL Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (in immediately available funds in Dollars) the net amounts as specified by the Administrative Agent. If any RL Lender fails to so deliver such net amounts to the Administrative Agent, distributions of amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement to such RL Lender shall be distributed instead to the Canadian Lenders (and applied to the purchase price owing to such Canadian Lenders) until such payments are made by such defaulting RL Lender or the Canadian Lenders have received the purchase price owing to them by the Defaulting Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver the amounts so received to the various RL Lenders in such amounts as are needed to effect the purchases and sales of participations as provided above. Promptly following receipt thereof, each RL Lender which has sold participations in any of its Revolving Loans (through the Administrative Agent) will deliver to each RL Lender (through the Administrative Agent) which has so purchased a participating interest a participation certificate dated the date of receipt of such funds and in such amount. It is understood that the amount of funds delivered by each RL Lender shall be calculated on a net basis, giving effect to both the sales and purchases of participations by the various RL Lenders as required above.
provided
 
(c) Upon, and after, the occurrence of a Sharing Event (i) no further Canadian Revolving Loans shall be made to any Borrower, (ii) all amounts from time to time accruing with respect to, and all amounts from time to time payable on account of, Canadian Revolving Loans (including, without limitation, any interest and other amounts which were accrued but unpaid on the date of such purchase) shall be payable in Dollars as if each such Canadian Revolving Loan had originally been made in Dollars and shall be distributed by the relevant RL Lenders (or their affiliates) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the RL
 
Lenders which are participating therein and (iii) the Maximum Canadian Dollar Revolving Loan Sub-Commitments of the various Canadian Lenders shall be automatically terminated (which shall result in a like increase to the U.S. Revolving Loan Sub-Commitments of the respective Lenders, except to the extent the Revolving Loan Commitments of the various Lenders are terminated as otherwise provided in this Agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the failure of any RL Lender to purchase its participating interests in any Revolving Loans upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event shall not relieve any other RL Lender of its obligation hereunder to purchase its participating interests in a timely manner, but no RL Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other RL Lender to purchase the participating interest to be purchased by such other RL Lender on any date.
 
(d) If any amount required to be paid by any RL Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(b) is paid to the Administrative Agent after the date such amount is required to be paid by such RL Lender but within three Business Days following the date upon which such RL Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent of the amount of its participations required to be purchased pursuant to Section 2.17(b), such RL Lender shall also pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount so required to be paid by such RL Lender for the purchase of its participations times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate, during the period from and including the date of request for payment to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Administrative Agent times (iii) a fraction of the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any RL Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(b) is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent within three Business Days following the date upon which such RL Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of participations required to be purchased by it, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover from such RL Lender on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such request date at the rate per annum applicable to Canadian Revolving Loans of the Tranche required to be purchased maintained as Canadian Prime Rate Loans hereunder. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any RL Lender with respect to any amounts payable under this Section 2.17 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Amounts payable by any RL Lender pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant RL Lenders; that, if the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion) has elected to fund on behalf of such RL Lender the amounts owing to such RL Lenders, then the amounts shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for its own account.
provided
 
(e) Whenever, at any time after the relevant RL Lenders have received from any RL Lenders purchases of participations in any Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.17, the various RL Lenders receive any payment on account thereof, such RL Lenders will distribute to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the various RL Lenders participating therein, such RL Lenders' participating interests in such amounts (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such participations were outstanding but also taking into account the payment of any interest in connection with the purchase of such participating interest pursuant to Section 2.18(b)) in like funds as received; , , that in the event that such payment received by any RL Lenders is required to be returned, the RL Lenders who received previous distributions in respect of their participating interests therein will return to the respective RL Lenders any portion thereof

(f) Each RL Lender's obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance including, without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such RL Lender may have against any other RL Lender, the relevant Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of any Borrower or any other Person, (iv) any breach of this Agreement by any Borrower or any Lender or any other Person, or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
 
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, upon any purchase of participations as required above, each RL Lender which has purchased such participations shall be entitled to receive from the relevant Borrowers any reasonable increased costs and indemnities (including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 2.11, 2.12, 2.16, 3.06 and 5.04) directly from the Borrowers to the same extent as if it were the direct Lender as opposed to a participant therein, which reasonable increased costs shall be calculated without regard to Section 2.13, Section 14.03(a) or the last sentence of Section 14.03(b). The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that, upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event and after giving effect to the requirements of this Section 2.17, increased Taxes may be owing by them pursuant to Section 5.04, which Taxes shall be paid (to the extent provided in Section 5.04) by the respective Borrowers, without any claim that the increased Taxes are not payable because same resulted from the participations effected as otherwise required by this Section 2.17.

At any time the U.S. Borrower may, but shall not be required, to request an estimate of adjustment costs by written request to the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of such request, the Administrative Agent shall solicit from the Lenders estimates (and the Lenders shall provide such estimates not later than 5 Business Days after such solicitation, promptly after the receipt of which the Administrative Agent shall provide a summary thereof to the U.S. Borrower) of costs payable under Sections 2.12 and 2.18(e) as a result of the proposed adjustment.

(b) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the U.S. Borrower that (i) the requested Letter of Credit may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section 3.02 and (ii) all of the applicable conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 shall be met at the time of such issuance. Unless the Issuing Bank has received notice from the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders before it issues a Letter of Credit that one or more of the conditions specified in Section 6 are not satisfied on the Effective Date or Section 7 are not then satisfied, or that the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate Section 3.02, then the Issuing Bank shall issue the requested Letter of Credit for the account of the U.S. Borrower in accordance with the Issuing Bank's usual and customary practices. Promptly after the issuance of or amendment to any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower, in writing, of such issuance or amendment and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. Promptly after receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each RL Lender in writing of such issuance or amendment and, if so requested by any RL Lender, the Administrative Agent shall furnish such RL Lender with a copy of the issued Letter of Credit or such amendment.
 
3.04. . (a) Immediately upon the issuance by the Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each RL Lender (other than the Issuing Bank) (each such Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit, in its capacity under this Section 3.04, a ""), and each Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from the Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, in a percentage equal to such Participant's Dollar Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each drawing or payment made thereunder and the obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto (although Letter of Credit Fees shall be paid directly to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the RL Lenders based on their Dollar Percentages as provided in Section 4.01(c) and the Participants shall have no right to

receive any portion of any Facing Fees); that, upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event, the participations described above shall be automatically adjusted so that each RL Lender shall have a participation in all then outstanding Letters of Credit under a Tranche, and related obligations as described above, in a percentage equal to its RL Percentage (which adjustments shall occur concurrently with the adjustments described in Section 2.17). Upon any change in the Revolving Loan Commitments or Dollar Percentages of the RL Lenders pursuant to this Agreement (or in the circumstances provided in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the RL Percentages of the RL Lenders pursuant to this Agreement), it is hereby agreed that, with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid Drawings of a Tranche, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section 3.04 to reflect the new Dollar Percentages or, in the circumstances described in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the RL Percentages of the various RL Lenders.

(b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall have no obligation relative to the Participants or any other Lenders other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), shall not create for the Issuing Bank any resulting liability to the U.S. Borrower, any other Credit Party, any Lender or any other Person.
 
(c) If the Issuing Bank makes any payment under any Letter of Credit and the U.S. Borrower shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 3.05(a), the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Participant of such failure, and each Participant shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank the amount of such Participant's Dollar Percentage (or, after the occurrence of a Sharing Event, its RL Percentage) of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in same day funds. If the Administrative Agent so notifies, prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on any Business Day, any Participant required to fund a payment under a Letter of Credit, such Participant shall make available to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank, in Dollars, such Participant's Dollar Percentage (or, after the occurrence of a Sharing Event, its RL Percentage) of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in same day funds; , , that no Participant shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank its Dollar Percentage (or, after the occurrence of a Sharing Event, its RL Percentage) of such unreimbursed amount for (i) any wrongful payment made by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction) and (ii) with respect to any Letter of Credit with an expiration date after the tenth Business Day prior to the Maturity Date, any payment made by the Issuing Bank in excess of the amount of cash collateral delivered by the U.S. Borrower pursuant to Section 3.02(a)(iii)(y). If and to the extent such Participant shall not have so made its Dollar Percentage (or, after the occurrence of a Sharing Event, its RL Percentage) of the amount of such payment available to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank, such Participant agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank,

The failure of any Participant to make available to the Issuing Bank its Dollar Percentage (or, after the occurrence of a Sharing Event, its RL Percentage) of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall not relieve any other Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Issuing Bank its Dollar Percentage (or, after the occurrence of a Sharing Event, its RL Percentage) of any unreimbursed payment with respect to a Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank such other Participant's Dollar Percentage (or, after the occurrence of a Sharing Event, its RL Percentage) of any such payment.
 
(d) Whenever the Issuing Bank receives a payment of a reimbursement obligation as to which it has received any payments from the Participants pursuant to clause (c) above, the Issuing Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of each Participant which has paid its Dollar Percentage (or, after the occurrence of a Sharing Event, its RL Percentage) thereof, in Dollars and in same day funds, an amount equal to such Participant's share (based upon the proportionate aggregate amount originally funded by such Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all Participants) of the principal amount of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.
 
(e) Upon the request of any Participant, the Issuing Bank shall furnish to such Participant copies of any Letter of Credit issued by it and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Participant.
 
(f) The obligations of the Participants to make payments to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it shall be irrevocable and not subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever (except as otherwise provided in the proviso to the second sentence of Section 3.04(c)) and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances:

To the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender's Revolving Loan Commitments and related outstanding Obligations or this Section 14.03(b) would, at the time of such assignment, result in increased costs or Taxes under Section 2.11, 2.12 or 5.04 from those being charged by the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay or reimburse such increased costs (although the Borrower shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective assignment).

(c) All parties hereto agree that the U.S. Borrower shall have no right of subrogation against any Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower or any Guarantor regarding any
 
payment of Canadian Obligations until all of the Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.
 
The U.S. Borrower warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above in this Section 16.09 is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law.
 
16.10. . This Guaranty is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. No failure or delay on the part of any Canadian Lenders in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Canadian Lenders or any subsequent holder of a Canadian Revolving Note, or issuer of, or participant in, a Letter of Credit would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on the U.S. Borrower in any case shall entitle the U.S. Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Canadian Lenders or any holder, creator or purchaser to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
Guaranty Continuing
 
16.11. . This Guaranty shall be binding upon the U.S. Borrower and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Canadian Lenders and their successors and assigns.

Similarly, on any such date, each Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower hereby authorizes each Canadian Lender to net all amounts payable on such date by such Canadian Lender to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower, against all amounts (including, without limitation, Acceptance Fees under paragraph (g) below) payable on such date by such Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower to such Canadian Lender in accordance with the Administrative Agent's calculations.
 
(g) . Each Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, in advance, for distribution to each Canadian Lender which accepts a Bankers' Acceptance (based on their respective Canadian RL Percentages), the applicable Acceptance Fee in respect of the Face Amount of such Bankers' Acceptance, which shall be payable on or before the date of acceptance of such Bankers' Acceptance. In connection with any conversion of an outstanding Bankers' Acceptance that is a Canadian Revolving A Loan to a Bankers' Acceptance that is a Canadian Revolving B Loan, or of an outstanding Bankers'

The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the applicable Canadian Lender and the applicable Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower of such calculations and on the next Business Day (a) the applicable Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower will pay to the applicable Canadian Lender the amount, if positive, by which the Required Acceptance Fee for the Remaining Term exceeds the Paid Acceptance Fee for the Remaining Term (the ""), and (b) the applicable Canadian Lender will pay to the applicable Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower the amount, if positive, by which the Paid Acceptance Fee for the Remaining Term exceeds the Required Acceptance Fee for the Remaining Term (the "").

(h) . Subject to paragraph (j) of this Schedule III, and except as otherwise provided under Section 2.17, no prepayment of any Bankers' Acceptances shall be made by any Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower prior to the maturity date of such Bankers' Acceptance. Each Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower hereby unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Canadian Lender an amount in Canadian Dollars equal to the Face Amount of each Bankers' Acceptance created by such Canadian Lender for the account of such Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower on the maturity date thereof (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) (notwithstanding that such Canadian Lender may be the holder of it at maturity).
Prepayments and Payments
 
(i) . Unless a Bankers' Acceptance of a Tranche is paid in full at the maturity thereof, or continued as another Canadian Revolving Loan by way of Bankers' Acceptances, the obligation of any Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower to any Canadian Lender in respect of a maturing Bankers' Acceptance of a Tranche accepted by such Canadian Lender shall be deemed to be converted automatically on the maturity date thereof into a Canadian Prime Rate Loan of that same Tranche under which the maturing Bankers' Acceptance was incurred in an amount equal to the full Face Amount of
Conversion to Canadian Prime Rate Loans upon Maturity
 
such maturing Bankers' Acceptance. Such Canadian Prime Rate Loan shall be subject to all of the provisions of the Credit Agreement applicable to a Canadian Prime Rate Loan of that same Tranche under which the maturing Bankers' Acceptance was incurred (or transferred in accordance with Section 2.07), including in particular the obligation to pay interest, from and after the maturity date of such Bankers' Acceptance. Each Canadian Lender shall be obligated to make the Canadian Prime Rate Loan contemplated under this paragraph (i) regardless of whether the conditions precedent to borrowing set forth in the Credit Agreement are then satisfied.
 
(j) . Upon the acceleration of the Canadian Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 12 of the Credit Agreement (whether by action of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, or automatically by reason of the occurrence of an Event of Default referred to in Section 12.05 with respect to any Borrower), each Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent in satisfaction of the obligations of such Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower to the Canadian Lenders in respect of then-outstanding Bankers' Acceptances, and there shall become immediately due and payable, an amount equal to (i) the aggregate Face Amount of all outstanding Bankers' Acceptances thereof; and (ii) all unpaid Acceptance Fees, if any.
Default
 
(k) . If the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) and notified the Canadian Revolving Loan Borrowers and each of the Canadian Lenders that, by reason of circumstances arising after the Effective Date and affecting the Canadian money market (i) there is no market for Bankers' Acceptances or (ii) the demand for Bankers' Acceptances is insufficient to allow the sale or trading of the Bankers' Acceptances created and purchased hereunder, then the right of any Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower to request that any Canadian Lender accept a Bankers' Acceptance shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent determines that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist and the Administrative Agent so notifies the Canadian Revolving Loan Borrowers.
Circumstances Making Bankers' Acceptances Unavailable
 
(l) . In addition to any liability of any Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower to any Lender or the Administrative Agent under any other provision hereof, each Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent and hold each of them harmless against any reasonable loss or expense incurred by such Lender or the Administrative Agent as a result of (x) any failure by such Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower to fulfill any of its obligations hereunder including, without limitation, any cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment in whole or in part of deposits or other funds required by any Lender to fund any Bankers' Acceptance as a result of the failure of such Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower to make any payment, repayment or prepayment on the date required hereunder or specified by it in any notice given hereunder or under the Credit Agreement; or (y) such Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower's failure to provide for the payment to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each of the Canadian Lenders, of the full Face Amount of each Bankers' Acceptance on its maturity date except for any failure arising from a conversion to Canadian Prime Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.07(b) of the Credit Agreement.
Indemnification in Respect of Bankers' Acceptances
 
(m) . Bankers' Acceptances purchased by a Canadian Lender may be held by it for its own account until the maturity date or sold by it at any time prior to that date in any relevant Canadian market in such Canadian Lender's sole discretion.
Canadian Lenders as Holders
 
(n) . For the purposes of the Credit Agreement and this Schedule III, all Bankers' Acceptances shall be considered a utilization of the Maximum Canadian Dollar Revolving Loan Sub-Commitments and the Revolving Loan Commitments in an amount equal to the aggregate Face Amount of such Bankers' Acceptances.

I am Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Host Marriott, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Company"), and in my capacity as such have acted as counsel to the Company and each U.S. subsidiary of the Company that is party to the Amended and Restated Subsidiaries Guaranty referred to below (collectively, the "U.S. Guarantors"), and have acted as special counsel to Calgary Charlotte Partnership, a Canadian partnership, HMC Toronto Air Company, a Canadian company, HMC Toronto EC Company, a Canadian company, HMC AP Canada Company, a Canadian company (collectively, the "Canadian Borrowers") and each Canadian subsidiary of the Company that is a party to the Amended and Restated Subsidiaries Guaranty (collectively the "Canadian Guarantors"), all in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 10, 2004 (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"), among the Company, the Canadian Borrowers, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Administrative Agent (the "Agent"), Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and the other agents and lenders from time to time party thereto (the "Lenders") and certain other Loan Documents (as hereinafter defined).

The Company and the U.S. Guarantors, other than the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties, are sometimes referred to collectively as the "Delaware Credit Parties".
 
In my examination of the Loan Documents and the other Documents, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the accuracy and completeness of all of the Documents, the authenticity of all originals of the Documents and the conformity to authentic originals of all of the Documents submitted to me as copies (including telecopies). As to matters of fact relevant to the opinions expressed herein, I have relied on the representations and statements of fact made in the Documents, I have not independently established the facts so relied on, and I have not made any investigation or inquiry other than my examination of the Documents. This opinion letter is given, and all statements herein are made, in the context of the foregoing.
 
For purposes of this opinion letter, I have assumed that (i) each Loan Document constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each party thereto enforceable against each such party in accordance with their respective terms, (ii) there has been no mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding or fraud, duress or undue influence in connection with the negotiation, execution or delivery of the Loan Documents, and the conduct of all parties to the Loan Documents has complied with any requirements of good faith, fair dealing and conscionability, (iii) there are and have been no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral, and there is and has been no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties that would, in either case, define, supplement or qualify the terms of the Loan Documents, and (iv) there is nothing in the laws of Canada or any other law not covered by this opinion letter that is relevant to the opinions expressed below. I have also assumed the validity and constitutionality of each relevant statute, rule, regulation and agency action covered by this opinion letter.
 
For purposes of the opinions set forth in Paragraph (c) below, I have made the following further assumptions: (i) that all orders, judgments, decrees, agreements and contracts would be enforced as written; and (ii) that all parties to the Loan Documents will act in accordance with, and will refrain from taking any action that is forbidden by, the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents.
 
This opinion letter is based as to matters of law solely on applicable provisions of the following, as currently in effect: (i) the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, as amended (the "Delaware LLC Act"), (ii) the Delaware Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as amended (the "Delaware Limited Partnership Act"), and (iii) as to the opinions given in Paragraph (d) below, except to the extent excluded below, federal statutes and regulations; , , that I express no opinion as to United States federal securities, antitrust, unfair competition, banking, or tax laws or regulations; and further provided that, with respect to clause (iii) above, the opinions expressed herein are based on a review of those laws, statutes and regulations that, in my experience, are generally recognized as applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents. (The federal law identified in clause (iii) above, subject to the exclusions and limitations set forth above, is referred to herein as "Applicable Federal Law.") I express no opinion as to any other laws, statutes, rules or regulations not specifically identified above.
provided
however
 
I am advised that, as to the matters relating to the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties referenced in Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) below, you are obtaining the opinion of Hogan & Hartson L.L.P. I am further advised that, as to the matters relating to the Canadian Borrowers and Canadian Guarantors referenced in Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) below, you are obtaining the opinions of Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLC and Cox Hanson O'Reilly Matheson.
 
Based upon, subject to and limited by the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
(a) Each Delaware Credit Party is validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware as a limited partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, as of the date of the certificate listed for such Credit Party on hereto.
Schedule II
 
(b) Each Delaware Credit Party has the limited partnership or limited liability company power, as the case may be, to execute, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance by each Delaware Credit Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary limited partnership or limited liability company action, as the case may be, of such Delaware Credit Party. Each Delaware Credit Party has duly executed and delivered each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party.
 
(c) The execution, delivery and performance as of the date hereof by each Delaware Credit Party of the Loan Documents to which it is party do not (i) in the case of each such party that is a partnership, violate the certificate of limited partnership of such party, the partnership agreement of such party or the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, (ii) in the case of each such party that is a limited liability company, violate the certificate of formation of such party, the limited liability company agreement of such party, or the Delaware LLC Act.
 
(d) No approval or consent of, or registration or filing with, any federal or state government agency is required to be obtained or made by the Credit Parties under Applicable Federal Law in connection with the execution, delivery and performance as of the date hereof by the Credit Parties of the Loan Documents other than filings to perfect the liens and security interests created by the Loan Documents.
 
My opinions expressed in Paragraph (c) above are subject to the qualification that certain organizational documents described in such Paragraph (c) may impose restrictions or prescribe consequences applicable to an exercise by the Agent of its rights to enforce the UCC security interests granted pursuant to the Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement, but that such restrictions and consequences are not implicated by the execution, delivery or performance as of the date hereof by any Delaware Credit Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party.
 
I hereby confirm to you that, to my knowledge, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or overtly threatened in writing against any Credit Party, or in which any Credit Party is a party, before any court or governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality that question the validity of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or any action taken or to be taken pursuant thereto, or that seek to enjoin or otherwise prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or to recover in damages or obtain other relief as a result thereof.
 
I assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter. This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with the closing under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on the date hereof, and should not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise be referred to, and should not be filed with or furnished to any governmental agency or other person or entity, without my prior written consent, except that the entities that become Lenders pursuant to an assignment of an interest in the Commitments and Loans pursuant to Section 14.03 of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may rely upon this opinion letter (it being understood that this opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof, and that no reliance by such entities will have any effect on the scope, phrasing or originally intended use of this opinion letter). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, each Lender may furnish a copy of this opinion letter (i) to any accountants, auditors and legal or other representatives of such Lender, (ii) to any governmental entity that has regulatory or supervisory authority over such Lender or pursuant to legal process or as otherwise required by law or regulation, or (iii) in connection with any judicial proceeding involving the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

In our examination of the Loan Documents and the other Documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the accuracy and completeness of all of the Documents, the authenticity of all originals of the Documents and the conformity to authentic originals of all of the Documents submitted to us as copies (including telecopies). As to matters of fact relevant to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied on the representations and statements of fact made in the Documents, we have not independently established the facts so relied on and we have not made any investigation or inquiry other than our examination of the Documents. This opinion letter is given, and all statements herein are made, in the context of the foregoing.
 
As used in this opinion letter, the phrase "to our knowledge" means the actual knowledge (that is, the conscious awareness of facts or other information) of lawyers currently in the firm who have given substantive legal attention to representation of the Credit Parties in connection with the Loan Documents.
 
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have assumed that (i) each party to the Loan Documents other than the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties (including, without limitation, all of the Credit Parties other than the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties) has all requisite power and authority under all applicable laws, regulations and governing documents to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the Agent, each of the Lenders and each such other party has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce the Loan Documents against the other parties thereto, (ii) each party to the Loan Documents other than the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties (including, without limitation, all of the Credit Parties other than the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties) has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Loan Documents to which it is a party, (iii) except as set forth in Paragraph (a) below, each party to the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all of the Credit Parties) is validly existing and in good standing in all necessary jurisdictions, (iv) each Loan Document constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each party thereto (except any Credit Party) enforceable against each such party in accordance with its respective terms, (v) there has been no mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding or fraud, duress or undue influence in connection with the negotiation, execution or delivery of the Loan Documents, and the conduct of all parties to the Loan Documents has complied with any requirements of good faith, fair dealing and conscionability, (vi) there are and have been no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral, and there is and has been no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties that would, in either case, define,
 
supplement or qualify the terms of the Loan Documents and (vii) there is nothing in the laws of Canada or any other law not covered by this opinion letter that is relevant to the opinions expressed below. We are advised that, as to the matters referenced in clauses (i) through (iii) above, (1) with respect to the Credit Parties (other than the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties, the Canadian Borrowers and the Canadian Guarantors), you are obtaining the opinion of the general counsel of HMC and its subsidiaries and (2) with respect to the Canadian Borrowers and the Canadian Guarantors, you are obtaining the opinions of Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLC and Cox Hanson O'Reilly Matheson. We have also assumed the validity of the determinations of the Board of Managers or other applicable governing body of each U.S. Guarantor and Canadian Guarantor concerning the necessity and convenience of the Subsidiaries Guaranty and the Pledge and Security Agreement, and have further assumed the value of the consideration received therefor. We have further assumed the validity and constitutionality of each relevant statute, rule, regulation and agency action covered by this opinion letter.
 
For the purposes of the opinion set forth in the second sentence of Paragraph (c) below, we have assumed that, pending the execution and delivery of each Revolving Note, all operative facts (and applicable law) will remain unchanged from those in existence on the date hereof.

Schedule II
 
For purposes of the opinion set forth in Paragraph (f) below, we have made the following further assumption, without any independent verification or investigation: that none of the Lenders is a broker or dealer under the Margin Regulations, defined below.

provided
however
 
Based upon, subject to and limited by the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
(a) Host of Houston is validly existing as a limited partnership under the laws of the State of Texas as of the date of the certificate specified in Paragraph 18 above. Host of Boston is validly existing as a limited partnership under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as of the date of the certificate specified in Paragraph 14 above. City Center is validly existing as a limited partnership under the laws of the State of Minnesota as of the date of the certificate specified in Paragraph 24 above.
 
(b) Each of the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties has the partnership power to execute, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties of the Loan Documents to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary partnership action of such Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Party. The Loan Documents to which each of the Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Parties is a party have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Non-Delaware U.S. Credit Party.
 
(c) Each of the Loan Documents to which each Credit Party is a party constitutes a valid and binding obligation of such Credit Party, enforceable against such Credit Party in accordance with its terms. Each Revolving Note, when duly prepared and executed in accordance with the Credit Agreement and delivered to the applicable Lender, will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the applicable Borrower, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms.
 
(d) The execution, delivery and performance on the date hereof by each Credit Party of the Loan Documents to which it is party do not (i) violate any applicable provision of any Applicable Federal Law or Applicable State Law; (ii) to our knowledge, violate any court or administrative order, judgment or decree that names any Credit Party and is specifically directed to it or any of its property; (iii) breach or constitute a default, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien as of the date hereof, under any Reviewed Agreement to which such Credit Party is a party (except that we express no opinion as to compliance with any financial covenants in any such Reviewed Agreement); (iv) in the case of Ameliatel, violate the
 
partnership agreement of Ameliatel or the Florida Revised Uniform Partnership Act of 1995; (v) in the case of Host of Boston, violate the partnership agreement or the certificate of limited partnership of Host of Boston or the Massachusetts Uniform Limited Partnership Act; (vi) in the case of Host of Houston, violate the partnership agreement or the certificate of limited partnership of Host of Houston or the Texas Revised Limited Partnership Act; (vii) in the case of Houston 1979, violate the partnership agreement of Houston 1979 or the Texas Revised Partnership Act; or (viii) in the case of City Center, violate the certificate of limited partnership or the partnership agreement of City Center or the Minnesota 1976 Uniform Limited Partnership Act.
 
(e) The Pledge and Security Agreement creates in favor of the Agent a UCC security interest in the right, title and interest of each Pledgor in and to the membership interests or partnership interests in the entities specified on hereto as being owned by such Pledgor (the "Collateral"). To the extent that such security interest in the right, title and interest of such Pledgor in and to the applicable Collateral can be perfected currently under the UCC by the filing of a financing statement, such security interest will be perfected by the timely filing of the applicable Financing Statement in the applicable Filing Office specified on hereto.
Schedule III
Schedule III
 
(f) The Revolving Loans and the use of the proceeds of the Revolving Loans, each in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, do not violate Section 7 of the Exchange Act or the Margin Regulations.

In addition to the qualifications, exceptions and limitations elsewhere set forth in this opinion letter, the opinions expressed in Paragraph (c) above are subject to the qualification that certain rights, remedies, waivers and other provisions of the Loan Documents and Revolving Notes may not be enforceable in accordance with their terms, but, subject to the exceptions, qualifications and limitations set forth elsewhere in this opinion letter, such unenforceability would not render the Loan Documents invalid as a whole or preclude (i) the judicial enforcement of the obligations of the Company or the Canadian Borrowers to pay the principal of the Revolving Loans and interest thereon at the rate or rates (but not including any increase in rate after default) set forth therein or the obligations of the Company to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any payments made under a Letter of Credit, (ii) the acceleration by the Agent of the Company's or the Canadian Borrowers' obligation to pay such principal, together with such interest, after a default by the Company or the Canadian Borrowers (A) in the payment of such principal or interest, or (B) in the performance of any other obligation of the Company or the Canadian Borrowers in circumstances in which a court will provide a remedy, (iii) with regard to such security interests granted by the Company under the Pledge and Security Agreement as have been created in accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, and assuming that the Agent will comply with all requirements of applicable procedural and substantive law, the enforcement of such security interests as provided in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code after a default by the Company in the payment of such principal or interest at maturity or following acceleration pursuant to clause (ii) above, (iv) the judicial enforcement of the
 
obligations of the U.S. Guarantors under the Subsidiaries Guaranty to pay the principal of the Revolving Loans and interest thereon at the rate or rates (but not including any increase in rate after default) set forth in the Credit Agreement or to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any payments made under a Letter of Credit after a default by the Company or the Canadian Borrowers in the payment of such principal, interest or reimbursement for payments made under a Letter of Credit at maturity or following acceleration pursuant to clause (ii) above, or (v) with regard to such security interests granted by each Pledgor under the Pledge and Security Agreement as have been created in accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, and assuming that the Agent will comply with all requirements of applicable procedural and substantive law, the enforcement of such security interests as provided in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code after a default by the Company or the Canadian Borrowers in the payment of such principal, interest or reimbursement for payments made under a Letter of Credit at maturity or following acceleration pursuant to clause (ii) above; , , that we express no opinion regarding the enforceability against the U.S. Guarantors and Canadian Guarantors of the Subsidiaries Guaranty or the Pledge and Security Agreement in the event of or with respect to (1) any modification to or amendment of the obligations of the Company or any Canadian Borrower under the Loan Documents that increases such obligations, or (2) any election of remedies, any act or omission by the Agent or its agents with respect to collateral, or any other conduct of the Agent or its agents, that in each case prejudices any U.S. Guarantor or Canadian Guarantor or constitutes a full or partial release or discharge of such U.S. Guarantor or Canadian Guarantor under applicable law.
provided
however
 
Our opinions expressed in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of Paragraph (d) above are subject to the qualification that certain Reviewed Agreements and organizational documents described in such clauses may impose restrictions or prescribe consequences applicable to an exercise by the Agent of its rights to enforce the UCC security interests referred to in Paragraph (e) above, but that such restrictions and consequences are not implicated by the execution, delivery or performance as of the date hereof by any Credit Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party. Our opinion expressed in clause (iii) of Paragraph (d) above is subject to the further qualification that certain of the Reviewed Agreements impose requirements of notice and/or a right of first refusal in favor of the non-Credit Party that is a party thereto prior to a transfer of a controlling interest in any such Credit Party, and we express no view as to the applicability of such provisions to the pledge of equity interests in any such Credit Party pursuant to the Pledge and Security Agreement.
 
In addition to the qualifications, exceptions and limitations elsewhere set forth in this opinion letter, our opinions expressed above are also subject to the effect of: (1) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights (including, without limitation, the effect of statutory and other law regarding fraudulent conveyances, fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers); (2) the exercise of judicial discretion and the application of principles of equity, good faith, fair dealing, reasonableness, conscionability and materiality (regardless of whether the applicable agreements are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (3) generally applicable rules of law that limit or affect the enforceability of provisions that purport to waive or to require waiver of (or have the effect of waiving) procedural, judicial or substantive rights or defenses.
 
We assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter. This opinion letter has been prepared solely for
 
your use in connection with the closing under the Credit Agreement on the date hereof, and should not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise be referred to, and should not be filed with or furnished to any governmental agency or other person or entity, without the prior written consent of this firm, except that entities that become Lenders pursuant to an assignment of an interest in the Commitments and Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 14.03 of the Credit Agreement may rely upon this opinion letter (it being understood that this opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof, and that no reliance by such entities will have any effect on the scope, phrasing or originally intended use of this opinion letter). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, each Lender may furnish a copy of this opinion letter (i) to any accountants, auditors and legal or other representatives of such Lender, (ii) to any governmental entity that has regulatory or supervisory authority over such Lender, or pursuant to legal process or as otherwise required by law or regulation, or (iii) in connection with any judicial proceeding involving the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

2.1.5 The Calgary Partnership has taken all necessary partnership action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the Partners on behalf of the Calgary Partnership of each of the Documents to which it is a party, and the other Canadian Dollar Revolving Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to each Canadian Lender which did not receive such a note today and the Calgary Partnership has duly executed each of the Documents to which it is a party.
 
2.1.6 Assuming that a Document has been unconditionally delivered in the State of New York (which we have been advised by counsel for the Lenders is the State where the Documents have actually been executed and delivered) by a Canadian Credit Party to the other parties to such Document in order to create a binding agreement between them, then, to the extent that the laws of a Province were to apply to the question of the delivery of such Document
1
, such Document has been duly delivered.
 
2.1.7 The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Canadian Credit Parties of each of the Documents to which it is a party (including the execution, delivery and performance by the Partners on behalf of the Calgary Partnership of the Documents to which the Calgary Partnership is a party) do not breach or result in a default under:
 
 
 
 
2.1.8 No authorization, consent, permit or approval of, or other action by, or filing or qualification with or notice to, any governmental agency or authority, regulatory body, court,
 
 
tribunal or other similar entity having jurisdiction in either of the Provinces under the laws of either of the Provinces or the federal laws of Canada applicable therein is required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by any of the Canadian Credit Parties of any of the Documents to which it is a party (including the execution, delivery and performance by the Partners on behalf of the Calgary Partnership of the Documents to which the Calgary Partnership is a party).
 
2.1.9 If a Document is sought to be enforced in any action or proceeding in either of the Provinces in accordance with the laws applicable to such Document as chosen by the parties, namely the laws of the State of New York, the courts of such Province would recognize such choice of laws provided that such choice of laws is bona fide (in the sense that it was not made with a view to avoiding the consequences of the laws of the jurisdiction with which the transaction has a real and substantial connection) and provided that such choice of laws is not contrary to public policy, public order or good morals as such terms are understood under the laws of such Provinces (""). To our current actual knowledge, the choice of the laws of the State of New York as the laws applicable to the Documents was not made by any Canadian Credit Party for the purpose of evading another system of law and would not offend Public Policy in either of the Provinces.
Public Policy
 
2.1.10 If a Document is sought to be enforced in any action or proceeding in either Province in accordance with the laws applicable to such Document as chosen by the parties, namely the laws of the State of New York, the courts of such Province would, subject to paragraph 2.1.9 hereof, apply the laws of the State of New York, to the extent specifically pleaded and proved, to all issues which under conflict of laws rules in effect in such Province are characterized to be contract issues, except such New York laws found by the relevant court (i) to be procedural in nature; (ii) to be of a revenue, expropriatory or penal nature; (iii) to be inconsistent with Public Policy; or (iv) to conflict with laws of such Province (the "") determined by such court to be of overriding effect. A court in either Province has, however, an inherent power to decline to hear such action or proceeding if it is contrary to Public Policy for it to do so, or if it is not the proper forum to hear such action, or if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Based solely on our review of the Documents, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications provided for in this opinion, the Overriding Local Laws would not impair the enforceability of the Documents against a Canadian Credit Party.
Overriding Local Laws
 
2.1.11 The laws of each of the Provinces permit an action to be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in such Province to enforce a final and conclusive judgement against the applicable Canadian Credit Party in respect of a Document by a court in the State of New York, which is not impeachable as void or voidable under the internal laws of the State of New York, for a sum certain if (i) the court rendering such judgement properly and appropriately exercised jurisdiction over the applicable Canadian Credit Party pursuant to the laws of such Province and of the laws of the State of New York; (ii) the applicable Canadian Credit Party was duly served with the process of the New York court or appeared to such process, (iii) such
in personam
 
 
judgement was not obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to natural justice and the enforcement of such judgement would not be inconsistent with Public Policy or contrary to any order made by the Attorney-General of Canada under the (Canada) or the Competition Tribunal under the (Canada) in respect of certain judgements (as therein defined); (iv) the cause of action giving rise to such judgement is recognized in such Province, (v) the enforcement of such judgement does not constitute, directly or indirectly, the enforcement of foreign revenue, expropriatory or penal laws; (vi) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is discovered prior to the rendering of judgement by the court of such Province; and (vii) there has been compliance with the (Ontario) or the Limitations Act (Alberta), as the case may be, which requires that an action to enforce a foreign judgement must be commenced within a period of six years of the date of the foreign judgement.

2.1.12 The submission by the Canadian Borrowers to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New York and the federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the Southern District of New York contained in Section 14.07 of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement would be recognized and given effect by the courts in the Provinces as a valid submission to the jurisdiction of such courts, provided that the provisions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement respecting service of process on the Canadian Borrowers are complied with. The submission by the Canadian Guarantors to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New York and the federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the Southern District of New York contained in Section 20 of the Amended and Restated Subsidiaries Guaranty would be recognized and given effect by the courts in the Provinces as a valid submission to the jurisdiction of such courts, provided that the provisions of the Amended and Restated Subsidiaries Guaranty respecting service of process on the Canadian Guarantors are complied with.
 
2.1.13 To our current actual knowledge, we have not been retained to represent any of the Canadian Credit Parties in respect of any:
 
 
 
 
that, if determined adversely to any of the Canadian Parties, would prohibit any of the Canadian Credit Parties from executing, delivering or performing any of their respective obligations under the Documents.
 
 
 
The foregoing opinions are subject to the following qualifications:
 
3.1.1 Where we express opinions based upon the state of our current actual knowledge, such opinions are qualified in that, except for (i) a review of the Secretary's Certificate and the Documents, and (ii) inquiries of solicitors presently with this firm who were directly involved in the preparation and negotiation of the Documents, the transactions contemplated thereby and this opinion regarding their current actual conscious recollections, we have not made any special or additional investigations, searches or inquiries.
 
3.1.2 The enforceability of each of the Documents is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, winding-up, moratorium and other similar laws of general application affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.
 
3.1.3 The enforceability of any Document may be limited by general principles of equity and the obligation to exercise discretionary powers in a reasonable manner, and no opinion is expressed regarding the availability of any equitable remedy (including those of specific performance and injunction) which remedies are only available in the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
3.1.4 The enforcement of any Document is subject to the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction to impose restrictions on the rights of creditors to enforce immediate payment of amounts stated to be payable on demand.
 
3.1.5 The awarding of costs is in the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
3.1.6 Pursuant to the (Canada), a judgment by a court in any province in Canada may be awarded in Canadian currency only and such judgment may be based on a rate of exchange in existence on a day other than the day of payment of such judgment.
Currency Act
 
3.1.7 Any requirement in any of the Documents that interest be paid at a higher rate after than before default, or providing for an additional penalty, charge or other similar payment after default, may not be enforceable on the basis that it may be seen to constitute a penalty rather than a genuine pre-estimate of damages.
 
3.1.8 No opinion is expressed regarding the enforceability of any provision of any Document which purports to provide that any portion thereof which is unenforceable may be severed without affecting the enforceability of the remaining provisions.
 
3.1.9 The enforceability of a waiver of the right to a jury trial in a civil action is subject to the discretion of a judge not to strike a jury notice.
 
 
3.1.10 A provision in any Document which purports to waive any statutory rights may not be enforceable.
 
3.1.11 The effectiveness of provisions which purport to relieve a Person from a liability or duty otherwise owed may be limited by law, and provisions requiring indemnification or reimbursement may not be enforced by a court, to the extent that they relate to the failure of such Person to have performed such liability or duty.
 
3.1.12 No opinion is expressed regarding the enforceability of any provisions in any of the Documents to the effect that modifications, amendments or waivers of or with respect to any of the Documents that are not in writing will be ineffective.
 
3.1.13 No opinion is expressed as to the enforceability of any provisions in any of the Documents which:
 
 
 
3.1.14 No opinion is expressed as to any taxes, levies, duties, imposts or charges which may be imposed upon, or exigible in respect of, any of the transactions contemplated by the Documents.
 
3.1.15 Any requirement that interest (as defined in the (Canada)) be paid, or which results in receipt by the Lender of such interest, at a rate in excess of 60% per annum may contravene Section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada) and may not be enforceable.

It may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent.

To the Persons listed on Schedule "A" to this Opinion
 
Dear Sirs/Madames:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have made the following assumptions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and to the qualifications expressed below, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Pledge and Security Agreement) and upon the exercise of rights and remedies under and pursuant to the Pledge and Security Agreement, any of the ULC Shares were assigned to the Pledgee, the Secured Creditors or their nominee such that the Pledgee, the Secured Creditors or their nominee were to become a "member" (within the meaning of the (Nova Scotia)) of HMC AP, then such member would, together with other then existing members of HMC AP and certain previous members thereof, be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of HMC AP. Courts have, in certain circumstances, found persons who were not entered on a company's register of members to be members of a company. These cases generally involve circumstances in which a person has subscribed for shares from the company but, for some reason, typically inadvertence, that person's name was not entered on the register of members, or in which persons have acted as would a member or have held themselves out as a member, or have otherwise participated in the company as a member.
Companies Act
 
We express no opinion on whether the Pledgee would be found to be a member of HMC AP by a Nova Scotia court if such person were to take any steps to exercise their rights to enforce their security pursuant to the Pledge and Security Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that, if determined adversely to any of the Companies, would prohibit any of the Companies from executing, delivering or performing any of their respective obligations under the Documents.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This opinion may be relied upon only by the Agent, the Lenders, their permitted assigns and successors and counsel to such parties for the purposes of the matters contemplated by this opinion. It may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent.

(i) except in the case of ULC Shares which have not been transferred to the Pledgee or a nominee of the Pledgee on the register of the issuer, to receive all amounts payable in respect of the Collateral otherwise payable to such Pledgor under Section 6 hereof;
 
(ii) to transfer all or any part of the Pledged Securities into the Pledgee's name or the name of its nominee or nominees;

Each Pledgor hereby waives and releases to the fullest extent permitted by law any right or equity of redemption with respect to the Collateral, whether before or after sale hereunder, and all rights, if any, of marshalling the Collateral and any other security for the Obligations or otherwise. At any such sale, unless prohibited by applicable law, the Pledgee on behalf of the Secured Creditors may bid for and purchase all or any part of the Collateral so sold free from any such right or equity of redemption. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.

Each Pledgor hereby waives any claims against the Pledgee arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Pledgee accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. If the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all the Obligations, the Pledgors shall be liable for the deficiency and the fees of any attorneys employed by the Pledgee to collect such deficiency. Neither the Pledgee nor any other Secured Creditor shall be liable for failure to collect or realize upon any or all of the Collateral or for any delay in so doing nor shall any of them be under any obligation to take any action whatsoever with regard thereto.

8. REMEDIES, ETC., CUMULATIVE. Each right, power and remedy of the Pledgee provided for in this Agreement or in any other Secured Debt Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy. The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor of any one or more of the rights, powers or remedies provided for in this Agreement or in any other Secured Debt Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the part of the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof.
 
The Secured Creditors agree that this Agreement may be enforced only by the Pledgee acting upon the instructions of the Required Secured Creditors (as defined in Section 4 of hereto) and that no other Secured Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Agreement or to realize upon the security to be granted hereby, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Pledgee for the benefit of the Secured Creditors upon the terms of this Agreement.

24. PLEDGEE NOT BOUND. (a) Nothing herein shall be construed to make the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor liable as a member of any limited liability company or
 
a partner of any partnership and the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise (except as referred to in the following sentence) shall not have any of the duties, obligations or liabilities of a member of any limited liability company or partner of any partnership. The parties hereto expressly agree that, unless the Pledgee shall become the absolute owner of the respective Pledged Limited Liability Company Interest or Pledged Partnership Interest pursuant hereto, this Agreement shall not be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture among the Pledgee, any other Secured Creditor and/or any Pledgor.
 
(b) Except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 24, the Pledgee, by accepting this Agreement, and the other Secured Creditors did not intend to become a member of any limited liability company or partner of any partnership or otherwise be deemed to be a co-venturer with respect to any Pledgor or any limited liability company or partnership either before or after an Event of Default shall have occurred.

25. CONTINUING PLEDGORS. The rights and obligations of each Pledgor (other than the respective released Pledgor in the case of following clause (y)) hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding (x) the addition of any new Pledgor as a party to this Agreement as contemplated by Section 22 hereof or otherwise and/or (y) the release of any Pledgor under this Agreement as contemplated by Section 21 hereof or otherwise.
 
26. NO FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE. Each Pledgor hereby confirms that it is its intention that this Agreement not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any similar Federal, state or foreign law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each Pledgor hereby irrevocably agrees that its obligations and liabilities hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of such Pledgor that are relevant under such laws, result in the obligations and liabilities of such Pledgor hereunder in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
27. CANADIAN REVOLVING LOAN BORROWERS. The Pledgors hereby acknowledge that pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement various Canadian Revolving Loan Borrowers may become a party to the Credit Agreement from time to time and incur Loans thereunder.

The headings in this Agreement are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or define the meaning hereof. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one instrument.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS).
 
29. .
WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY.
EACH PLEDGOR AND EACH SECURED CREDITOR (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS AGREEMENT) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS TO WHICH SUCH PLEDGOR IS A PARTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY
 
30. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
31. ULC SHARES. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other document or agreement among all or some of the parties hereto, with respect to any Collateral which constitutes ULC Shares, the relevant Pledgor of such ULC Shares is the sole registered and beneficial owner of all ULC Shares and will remain so until such time as such ULC Shares are effectively transferred into the name of the Pledgee, any Secured Party or any other person on the books and records of the ULC issuer of such ULC Shares. Accordingly, the relevant Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain for its own account any dividend on or other distribution, if any, in respect of such Collateral (except pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof) and shall have the right to vote such Collateral and to control the direction, management and policies of the ULC issuer to the same extent as the Pledgor would if such Collateral were not pledged to the Pledgee (for its own benefit and for the benefit of the Secured Parties) pursuant hereto. Nothing in this Agreement or any other document or agreement among all or some of the parties hereto is intended to, and nothing in this Agreement or any other document or agreement among all or some of the parties hereto shall, constitute the Pledgee, any of the Secured Parties or any person other than the Pledgor, a member of a ULC for the purposes of NSCA until such time as notice is given to the Pledgor and further steps are taken thereunder so as to register the Pledgee or other person as holder of ULC Shares. To the extent any provision hereof would have the effect of constituting the Pledgee or any of the
 
Secured Parties as a member of any ULC prior to such time, such provision shall be severed therefrom and ineffective with respect to Collateral which are ULC Shares without otherwise invalidating or rendering unenforceable this Agreement or invalidating or rendering unenforceable such provision insofar as it relates to Collateral which are not ULC Shares. Except upon the exercise of rights to sell or otherwise dispose of the Pledged Stock issued by a ULC following the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, no Pledgor shall cause or permit, or enable any ULC in which they hold ULC Shares to cause to permit, the Pledgee or other Secured Parties to: (a) be registered as shareholders or members of such ULC; (b) have any notation entered in their favor in the share register of such ULC; (c) be held out as shareholders or members of such ULC; (d) receive, directly or indirectly, any dividends, property or other distributions from the ULC by reason of the Pledgee or the Secured Parties holding a security interest in the ULC; or (e) act as a shareholder or member of the ULC, or exercise any rights of a shareholder or member including the right to attend a meeting of, or to vote the shares of, the ULC.
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Pledgor has caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered by its duly authorized officer on the date first above written.

WHEREAS, each Guarantor is a direct or an indirect Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower;
 
WHEREAS, it was a condition to the making of revolving loans and other extensions of credit under the Original Credit Agreement that the guarantors party to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of June 6, 2002 (the "") shall have executed and delivered the Original Guaranty; and
Original Guaranty
 
WHEREAS, it is a condition to the making of Revolving Loans and other extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement that each Guarantor shall have amended and restated the Original Guaranty as provided herein; and
 
WHEREAS, each Guarantor will obtain benefits from the incurrence of Revolving Loans by, and other extensions of credit to, the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement and the entering into by the U.S. Borrower of the Guaranteed Hedging Agreements referred to above and, accordingly, desires to execute this Guaranty in order to satisfy the conditions described in the preceding paragraph;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other benefits accruing to each Guarantor, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby amends and restates the Original Guaranty in its entirety as set forth herein:
 
1. Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees: (i) to the Lender Creditors the full and prompt payment when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of (x) the principal of and interest on the Notes issued by, and the Revolving Loans made to, each Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the reimbursement obligations in respect of all Letters of Credit and (y) all other obligations (including obligations which, but for the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, would become due) and liabilities owing by the Borrowers to the Lender Creditors under the Credit Agreement and each other Credit Document to which any of the Borrowers is a party (including, without limitation, indemnities, Fees and interest thereon), whether now existing or hereafter incurred under, arising out of or in connection with the Credit Agreement and each such other Credit Document and the due performance and compliance by the Borrowers with all of the terms, conditions and agreements contained in the Credit Agreement and in each such other Credit Document (all such principal, interest, liabilities and obligations being herein collectively called the "Credit Agreement Obligations"); and (ii) to each Other Creditor, the full and prompt payment when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of all obligations (including obligations which, but for the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, would become due) and liabilities owing by the Borrower under any Guaranteed Hedging Agreement, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, and the due performance and compliance by the Borrower with all of the terms, conditions and agreements contained in the Guaranteed Hedging Agreements (all such obligations and liabilities being herein collectively called the "Other Obligations" and, together with the Credit Agreement Obligations, are herein collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Each Guarantor understands, agrees and confirms that the Creditors may enforce this Guaranty up to the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations against each Guarantor without proceeding against any other Guarantor, against any Borrower, against any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or under any other guaranty covering all or a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations.
 
2. Additionally, each Guarantor, jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees the payment of any and all Guaranteed Obligations to the Creditors whether or not due or payable by the Borrowers upon the occurrence in respect of any of the Borrowers of any of the events specified in Section 12.05 of the Credit Agreement, and absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably, jointly and severally, promises to pay such
 
Guaranteed Obligations to the Creditors, or order, on demand, in lawful money of the United States or in such other currency as may be required by the Credit Agreement. This Guaranty shall constitute a guaranty of payment, and not of collection.
 
3. The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the indebtedness of the Borrowers, whether executed by such Guarantor, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other party, and the liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by any circumstance or occurrence whatsoever, including, without limitation: (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrowers or by any other party, (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the indebtedness of the Borrowers, (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking except to the extent that any such payment or reduction results in the actual permanent reduction of the Guaranteed Obligations, (d) any dissolution, termination or change in personnel by any Borrower, (e) any payment made to any Creditor on the indebtedness which any Creditor repays any Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, or otherwise, and each Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding, (f) any action or inaction by the Creditors as contemplated in Section 6 hereof, or (g) any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any security therefor.
 
4. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or any Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or any Borrower and whether or not any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or any Borrower be joined in any such action or actions. Each Guarantor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any payment by a Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to such Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to each Guarantor.
 
5. Each Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any liability to which it may apply, and waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment of any such liabilities, suit or taking of other action by the Administrative Agent or any other Creditor against, and any other notice to, any party liable thereon (including such Guarantor, any other guarantor or any Borrower).
 
6. Any Creditor may at any time and from time to time without the consent of, or notice to, any Guarantor, without incurring responsibility to such Guarantor, and without impairing or releasing the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole or in part:
 
(a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or extend the time of payment of, renew or alter, any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the rate of interest thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred
 
directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and the guaranty herein made shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered;
 
(b) take and hold security for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations and sell, exchange, release, surrender, impair, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset there against, and/or release any Person liable for all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations;
 
(c) act or fail to act in any manner referred to in this Guaranty which may deprive such Guarantor of its right to subrogation against the Borrowers to recover full indemnity for any payments made pursuant to this Guaranty; and/or
 
(d) take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of such Guarantor from it liabilities under this Guaranty.
 
7. No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any security therefor shall affect, impair or be a defense to this Guaranty, and this Guaranty shall be primary, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or the existence of any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor except indefeasible payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.
 
8. This Guaranty is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. No failure or delay on the part of any Creditor in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Creditor would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of any Creditor to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. It is not necessary for any Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrowers or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
 
9. Any indebtedness of any Borrower now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the indebtedness of such Borrower to the Creditors; and such indebtedness of such Borrower to any Guarantor, if the Administrative Agent, after an Event of Default has occurred, so requests at a time when any Guaranteed Obligations are outstanding, shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Creditors and be paid over to the Creditors on account of the indebtedness of such Borrower to the Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of such Guarantor
 
under the other provisions of this Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by any Guarantor of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any indebtedness of a Borrower to such Guarantor, such Guarantor shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby agrees with the Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash (it being understood that each Guarantor is not waiving any right of subrogation that it may otherwise have but is only waiving the exercise thereof as provided above).
 
10. (a) Each Guarantor waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the Creditors to: (i) proceed against the Borrowers, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party; (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrowers, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party; or (iii) pursue any other remedy in the Creditors' power whatsoever. Each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, such Guarantor, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrowers, such Guarantor, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrowers other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the other Creditors by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales or exercise any other right or remedy the Creditors may have against the Borrowers or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full. Each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrowers or any other party or any security.
 
(b) Each Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Creditors shall have no duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
11. In order to induce the Lender Creditors to enter into the Credit Agreement and to make the Revolving Loans pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and to induce the Other Creditors to enter into the Guaranteed Hedging Agreements, each Guarantor represents, warrants and covenants that:
 
(a) . Such Guarantor (i) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company, as the case may be, in good standing (if applicable) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has the corporate, partnership, trust or limited liability company power and authority, as the case may be, to own or lease its property and assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and presently proposes to engage and (iii) is duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for failures to be so qualified which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Status
 
(b) Such Guarantor has the corporate, partnership, trust or limited liability company power and authority, as the case may be, to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of this Guaranty and each other Credit Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary corporate, partnership, trust or limited liability company action, as the case may be, to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of each such Credit Document. Such Guarantor has duly executed and delivered this Guaranty and each other Credit Document to which it is a party and each such Credit Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability hereof and thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law).
Power and Authority.
 
(c) . Neither the execution, delivery or performance by such Guarantor of this Guaranty or any other Credit Document to which it is a party, nor compliance by it with the terms and provisions hereof and thereof (i) will contravene any applicable provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, (ii) will conflict or be inconsistent with or result in any breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any Lien (except pursuant to the Pledge and Security Agreement) upon any of the property or assets of such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, credit agreement or loan agreement or any other material agreement, contract or instrument to which such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets is bound or to which it may be subject except for violations and defaults that may arise under contracts of such Guarantor otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement as a result of the sale of, or foreclosure of a lien upon, the Securities (as defined in the Pledge and Security Agreement) of Subsidiaries pledged under the Pledge and Security Agreement to the extent that the prior consent of other parties to such contracts have not been obtained or other actions specified in such contracts have not been taken in connection with any such sale or foreclosure, or (iii) will violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation, certificate of partnership, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or by-laws of such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.
No Violation
 
(d) . No order, consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with (except as have been obtained or made), or exemption by, any governmental or public body or authority, or any
Governmental Approvals
 
subdivision thereof, is required to authorize, or is required in connection with, (i) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty or any other Credit Document to which such Guarantor is a party or (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Guaranty or any other Credit Document to which such Guarantor is a party.
 
(e) Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best knowledge of such Guarantor, threatened (i) which purport to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of this Guaranty or (ii) that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
12. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees that on and after the Effective Date and until the Total Revolving Loan Commitment has terminated and when no Note remains outstanding and all Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, such Guarantor shall take, or will refrain from taking, as the case may be, all actions that are necessary to be taken or not taken so that no violation of any provision, covenant or agreement contained in Section 10 or 11 of the Credit Agreement occurs, and so that no Default or Event of Default is caused by the actions of such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.
 
13. The Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree to pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each Creditor in connection with the enforcement of this Guaranty (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) and the out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with any amendment, waiver or consent relating hereto (including reasonable legal fees and expenses).
 
14. This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Creditors and their successors and assigns; provided, however, that, except as otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement, no Guarantor may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders (and any such attempted assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void).
 
15. Neither this Guaranty nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated except with the written consent of each Guarantor directly affected thereby and with the written consent of (i) the Required Lenders, or, to the extent required by Section 14.11 of the Credit Agreement, each of the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, as the case may be, so long as any Credit Agreement Obligations remain outstanding and (ii) in any situation not covered by preceding clause (i), to the extent expressly required under any Guaranteed Hedging Agreement, the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Other Obligations; provided, that any change, waiver, modification or variance affecting the rights and benefits of a single Class (as defined below) of Creditors (and not all Creditors in a like or similar manner) shall require the written consent of the Requisite Creditors (as defined below) of such Class of Creditors (it being understood that the addition or release of any Guarantor hereunder shall not constitute a change, waiver, discharge or termination affecting any Guarantor other than the Guarantor so added or released). For the purpose of this Guaranty, the term "Class" shall mean each class of Creditors, i.e., whether (x) the Lender Creditors as holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations or (y) the Other Creditors as the holders of the Other Obligations. For the purpose of this Guaranty, the term "Requisite Creditors" of any Class shall
 
mean (x) with respect to the Credit Agreement Obligations, the Required Lenders, or, to the extent required by Section 14.11 of the Credit Agreement, each of the Lenders, and (y) with respect to the Other Obligations, the holders of at least a majority of all obligations outstanding from time to time under the respective Guaranteed Hedging Agreements.
 
16. Each Guarantor acknowledges that an executed (or conformed) copy of each of the Credit Documents has been made available to such Guarantor and such Guarantor is familiar with the contents thereof.
 
17. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 151 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law) and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (such term to mean and include any "Event of Default" as defined in the Credit Agreement or any payment default under any Guaranteed Hedging Agreement continuing after any applicable grace period), each Creditor is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor or to any other Person, any such notice being expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Creditor to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of such Guarantor to such Creditor under this Guaranty, irrespective of whether or not such Creditor shall have made any demand hereunder and although said obligations, liabilities, deposits or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured.
 
18. All notices, requests, demands or other communications pursuant hereto shall be deemed to have been duly given or made when delivered to the Person to which such notice, request, demand or other communication is required or permitted to be given or made under this Guaranty, addressed to such party at (i) in the case of any Lender Creditor, as provided in the Credit Agreement, (ii) in the case of any Guarantor, at the address of the U.S. Borrower specified in the Credit Agreement, and (iii) in the case of any Other Creditor, at such address as such Other Creditor shall have specified in writing to the Guarantors; or in any case at such other address as any of the Persons listed above may hereafter notify the others in writing.
 
19. If claim is ever made upon any Creditor for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any of the aforesaid payees repays all or part of said amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such payee or any of its property or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such payee with any such claimant (including a Borrower), then and in such event each Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon such Guarantor, notwithstanding any revocation hereof or other instrument evidencing any liability of a Borrower, and such Guarantor shall be and remain liable to the aforesaid payees hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by any such payee.
 
20. (A) This Guaranty shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Guarantor (although no Guarantor may assign its rights and obligations hereunder except in accordance with Section 14 hereof) and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
 
Administrative Agent and the other Creditors and their respective successors and assigns. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty or any other Credit Document to which any Guarantor is a party may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, in each case which are located in the City of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Guaranty, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each Guarantor hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any such courts lack jurisdiction over such Guarantor, and agrees not to plead or claim in any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty or any other Credit Document to which such Guarantor is a party brought in any of the aforesaid courts that any such court lacks jurisdiction over such Guarantor. Each Guarantor further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to each Guarantor at its address set forth opposite its signature below, such service to become effective 30 days after such mailing. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection to such service of process and further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any action or proceeding commenced hereunder or under any other Credit Document to which such Guarantor is a party that service of process was in any way invalid or ineffective. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any of the Creditors to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against each Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE CREDITORS AND OF THE UNDERSIGNED HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
(A) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty or any other Credit Document to which such Guarantor is a party brought in the courts referred to in clause (a) above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
 
(B) . .
WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
EACH GUARANTOR AND EACH CREDITOR (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS GUARANTY) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS TO WHICH SUCH GUARANTOR IS A PARTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY
 
21. In the event that all of the capital stock of one or more Guarantors is sold or otherwise disposed of or liquidated in compliance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement (or such sale or other disposition has been approved in writing by the Required Lenders (or, to the extent required by the Credit Agreement, each of the Lenders)) and the proceeds of such sale, disposition or liquidation are applied in accordance with (and to the extent required by) the provisions of the Credit Agreement, to the extent applicable, or in the circumstances set forth in Section 10.15(a)(2) of the Credit Agreement with respect to a Guarantor or in circumstances where the Collateral is released pursuant to Section 14.20 of the
 
Credit Agreement, in any such case such Guarantor shall be released from this Guaranty and this Guaranty shall, as to each such Guarantor or Guarantors, terminate, and have no further force or effect (it being understood and agreed that the sale or other disposition of one or more Persons that own, directly or indirectly, all of the capital stock, partnership interests or limited liability company interests of any Guarantor shall be deemed to be a sale of such Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 21) and the Administrative Agent, at the request and expense of the respective Guarantor, will promptly execute and deliver to such Guarantor a proper instrument or instruments acknowledging such release.
 
22. Each Guarantor hereby confirms that it is its intention that this Guaranty not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any similar Federal, state or foreign law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, if enforcement of the liability of any Guarantor under this Guaranty for the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations would be an unlawful or voidable transfer under any applicable fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or any comparable law, then the liability of such Guarantor hereunder shall be reduced to the maximum amount for which such liability may then be enforced without giving rise to an unlawful or voidable transfer under any such law.
 
23. To the extent that any Guarantor shall be required hereunder to pay a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which shall exceed the greater of (i) the amount of the economic benefit actually received by such Guarantor from the incurrence of the Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement and the entering into of Guaranteed Hedging Agreements and (ii) the amount which such Guarantor would otherwise have paid if such Guarantor had paid the aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (excluding the amount thereof repaid by the Borrower and the other Guarantors) in the same proportion as such Guarantor's net worth at the date enforcement hereunder is sought bears to the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors at the date enforcement hereunder is sought (the "Contribution Percentage"), then such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution against each other Guarantor who has made payments in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date enforcement hereunder is sought in an aggregate amount less than such other Guarantor's Contribution Percentage of the aggregate payments made to and including the date enforcement hereunder is sought by all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations; provided, that no Guarantor may take any action to enforce such right until the Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Total Revolving Loan Commitment has been terminated, it being expressly recognized and agreed by all parties hereto that any Guarantor's right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 23 against any other Guarantor shall be expressly junior and subordinate to such other Guarantor's obligations and liabilities in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any other obligations owing under this Guaranty. All parties hereto recognize and agree that, except for any right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 23, each Guarantor who makes any payment in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have no right of contribution or subrogation against any other Guarantor in respect of such payment. Each of the Guarantors recognizes and acknowledges that the rights to contribution arising hereunder shall constitute an asset in favor of the party entitled to such contribution. In this connection, each Guarantor has the right to waive its contribution right against any Guarantor to the extent that after giving effect to such waiver such Guarantor would remain solvent, in the determination of the Required Lenders.
 
24. This Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the Guarantors and the Administrative Agent.
 
25. All payments made by any Guarantor hereunder will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense.
 
26. It is understood and agreed that any Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower that is required to execute a counterpart of this Guaranty pursuant to the Credit Agreement shall automatically become a Guarantor hereunder by executing a counterpart hereof and delivering the same to the Administrative Agent or by executing and delivering a supplement hereto in the form of Annex 1 hereto.
 
27. Any provision of this Guaranty held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be executed and delivered as of the date first above written.

ANNEX 1 TO AMENDED AND RESTATED
SUBSIDIARIES GUARANTY
 
 
SUPPLEMENT NO. dated as of [] (this "Supplement"), to the Amended and Restated Subsidiaries Guaranty, dated as of , (the "Guaranty"), made by the Guarantors party thereto (immediately before giving effect to this Supplement) and accepted by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as Collateral Agent and Pledgee (each capitalized term used but not defined having the meaning given it in the Guaranty) for the benefit of the Creditors.
    
                            
                    
        
 
A. Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 10, 2004 (as amended or modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), among Host Marriott, L.P. (the "U.S. Borrower"), each Canadian Revolving Loan Borrower from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the "Lenders"), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Administrative Agent.
 
B. The Guarantors have entered into the Guaranty in order to induce the Lenders to make Revolving Loans and to issue, and participate in, Letters of Credit pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in, the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to Section 10.15 of the Credit Agreement, certain Subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower may, after the date of the Guaranty, be required to enter into the Guaranty as a Guarantor. Section 26 of the Guaranty provides that such additional Subsidiaries may become Guarantors under the Guaranty by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form of this Supplement. The undersigned (the "New Subsidiary Guarantor") is a Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower and is executing this Supplement in accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement to become a Guarantor under the Guaranty in order to induce the Lenders to make additional Revolving Loans and to issue, and participate in, additional Letters of Credit and as consideration for Loans previously made and Letters of Credit previously issued.
 
Accordingly, the Collateral Agent and the New Subsidiary Guarantor agree as follows:
 
SECTION 1. In accordance with Section 26 of the Guaranty, the New Subsidiary Guarantor by its signature below becomes a Guarantor under the Guaranty with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as a Guarantor and the New Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Guaranty applicable to it as a Guarantor thereunder. Each reference to a "Guarantor" in the Guaranty shall be deemed to include the New Subsidiary Guarantor. The Guaranty is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
 
SECTION 2. The New Subsidiary Guarantor represents and warrants to the Creditors that (i) this Supplement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its
 
terms, subject to the effects of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws effecting creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability and (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 11 of the Guaranty are true and correct as of the date hereof as to the New Subsidiary Guarantor.
 
SECTION 3. This Supplement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one instrument. This Supplement shall become effective when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts of this Supplement that, when taken together, bear the signatures of the New Subsidiary Guarantor and the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 4. Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect.
 
SECTION 5. THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
SECTION 6. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Supplement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, neither party hereto shall be required to comply with such provision for so long as such provision is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, but the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and in the Guaranty shall not in any way be affected or impaired. The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
 
SECTION 7. All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in the Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to the New Subsidiary Guarantor shall be given to it at the address set forth under its signature, with a copy to the U.S. Borrower.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the New Subsidiary Guarantor and the Collateral Agent have duly executed this Supplement to the Guaranty as of the day and year first above written.
