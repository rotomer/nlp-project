% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due December 2, 2026 (the "Debentures"). The redemption date for the Debentures is January 11, 2006 pursuant to a notice provided to the holders of the Debentures by the trustee on December 12, 2005. The Debentures were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of December 6, 1996, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee, as supplemented to date (the "Indenture"). Under the terms of the Indenture the Company is currently required to pay a call premium equal to 0.675%, or approximately $675,000, in order to redeem the Debentures prior to their scheduled maturity.
 
Upon the Company's conversion to a REIT, it assumed primary liability for repayment of the Debentures underlying the 6

% convertible quarterly income preferred securities (the "Convertible Preferred Securities"), of Host Marriott Financial Trust (the "Trust"), a wholly owned subsidiary trust of the Company. Upon conversion by a Convertible Preferred Securities holder, the Company will issue shares of common stock which will be delivered to such holder.
 
Upon the redemption of the Debentures discussed above, the Convertible Preferred Securities will be redeemed at a price equal to 100.675% of the liquidation preference, or $50.3375 per security.
 
Each of the Convertible Preferred Securities and the related debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Company's common stock at the rate of 3.2537 shares per Convertible Preferred Security for a total of approximately 31 million shares, (equivalent to a conversion price of $15.367 per share of the Company's common stock). The Trust will only convert the Debentures pursuant to a notice of conversion by a holder of Convertible Preferred Securities. The conversion ratio and price have been adjusted to reflect certain transactions including the Company's conversion to a REIT. In addition, the Company has the right to terminate the conversion rights, upon 30 days advance notice, in the event the price of its common stock exceeds $18.44 (equal to 120% of the conversion price) for 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
