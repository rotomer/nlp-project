Item 1.02Termination of Material Definitive Agreement
On and effective May 2, 2007, various subsidiaries of the Company defeased the lien encumbering the collateral that secured the loan made pursuant to that certain Loan Agreement dated July 8, 1999 with Bankers Trust Company, as lender (the "CMBS Loan"). In connection with the defeasance, the Company replaced the collateral for the CMBS loan with treasury securities and was released from its obligations under the CMBS Loan (other than obligations resulting from any Event of Default arising prior to the defeasance as a result of which the lender suffers a loss and certain customary obligations that specifically survive termination of the CMBS Loan).
The CMBS Loan was a non-recourse financing secured by a portfolio of 8 hotels, and bore fixed annual interest rates as follows:
with respect to Component A of $214,117,105, 7.05315%;
