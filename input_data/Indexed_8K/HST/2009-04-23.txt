On April 23, 2009, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it has commenced a public offering of 60,000,000 shares of its common stock to the public. After considering the effect of the proposed offering of 60,000,000 shares of common stock, the receipt of the expected net offering proceeds and the use of those proceeds for the repayment of debt and other corporate purposes, the Company expects that the offering would have a dilutive effect of approximately $.05 and $.03 from our previously announced forecast of the loss per diluted share and funds from operations per diluted share, respectively, for the full-year ending December 31, 2009.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
FFO per Diluted Share
We present Funds From Operations (FFO) per diluted share as a non-generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate FFO per diluted share for a given operating period as our FFO (defined as set forth below) for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities, including the payment of preferred stock dividends, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. We believe that FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders per share to FFO per diluted share (in millions, except per share amounts) after giving effect to the proposed offering:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The amounts shown in these forecasts are based on these and other assumptions, as well as management's estimate of operations for 2009. These forecasts are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual transactions, results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The information in this item shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of Section 18, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any disclosure document relating to the company, except to the extent, if any, expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
The statements above that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project," "will," "continue" and other similar terms and phrases, including references to assumption and forecasts of future results. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. These risks include, but are not limited to: national and local economic and business conditions, including the potential for terrorist attacks, that will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services; operating risks associated with the hotel business; risks associated with the level of our indebtedness and our ability to meet covenants in our debt agreements; relationships with property managers; our ability to maintain our properties in a first-class manner, including meeting capital expenditure requirements; our ability to compete effectively in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate structures; changes in travel patterns, taxes and government regulations which influence or determine wages, prices, construction procedures and costs; our ability to complete acquisitions and dispositions; and our ability to continue to satisfy complex rules in order for us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described in the Company's filings with the SEC. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that any deviation will not be material.
 
Based on the expected issuance of the shares in the public offering described above, the Company expects that its common stock dividend, which it expects to declare in the fourth quarter, would be $.27 to $.32 per share, which may be payable either in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition
 
of any such future dividends, will be the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness and preferred shares, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, state law and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. While the statements above concerning the remaining dividends for 2009 are our current expectation, the actual dividend payable will be determined by our Board of Directors based upon the circumstances at the time of declaration and the actual dividend payable may vary from such expected amounts.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
