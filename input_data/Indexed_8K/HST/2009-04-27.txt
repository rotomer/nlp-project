No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be
 
just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), each Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or any controlling person of the Underwriters, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
11. If for any reason, any Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the you in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
12. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to: c/o Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, One Bryant Park, New York, N.Y. 10036, facsimile: (646) 855-5016, Attention: Syndicate Department, and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
13. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or the Underwriters, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from the Underwriters shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
14. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.
15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) the Underwriter has not assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
16. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
17. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
18. The Company and the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
19. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
20. If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us six counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Underwriters and the Company.

Exhibit 8.1
Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.
6903 Rockledge Drive
Suite 1500
Bethesda, Maryland 20817
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This firm has acted as special tax counsel to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Host REIT"), in connection with the sale to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representatives of the underwriters (the "Underwriters") named in to that certain Underwriting Agreement dated April 24, 2009, of an aggregate of 75,750,000 shares (the "Shares") of Host REIT's common stock, $0.01 par value (the "Offering"). The Offering is more fully described in Host REIT's prospectus supplement dated April 24, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), to Host REIT's prospectus dated November 25, 2008 (the "Prospectus") that was part of the automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-155689) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 25, 2008 and pursuant to which the Shares have been registered.
Schedule I
In connection with the Offering, we have been asked to provide to you the legal opinions set forth herein. Capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise defined in the body of this letter, shall have the meanings set forth in .
Appendix A
Bases for Opinions
The opinions set forth in this letter are based on relevant current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"), Treasury Regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which may or may not be retroactive in effect and that might result in material modifications of our opinion. Our opinions do not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury

Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel's best professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS.
In rendering the following opinions, we have examined such statutes, regulations, records, agreements, certificates and other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion, including, but not limited to, the following:

April 27, 2009

The opinions set forth in this letter are also premised on certain written factual representations of Host REIT and Host LP regarding the organization, ownership and operations (including the income, assets, businesses, liabilities, properties and accumulated undistributed earnings and profits) of Host REIT, Host LP, the Partnership Subsidiaries, the Non-Controlled Subsidiaries, the Taxable REIT Subsidiaries, the Subsidiary REITs, the Host Employee/Charitable Trust, Crestline, and the Lessees, contained in a letter to us dated as of the date hereof (the "Representation Letter").
For purposes of rendering our opinions, although we have knowledge as to certain of the facts set forth in the above-referenced documents, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in such documents, including the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Representation Letter. We consequently have relied upon the representations as to factual matters in the Representation Letter and assumed that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us is accurate and complete in all material respects.
In this regard, we have assumed or obtained representations regarding (and, with your consent, are relying upon) the following:

Opinions
Based upon, subject to, and limited by the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein (including those set forth below), we are of the opinion that:
 
 
Host REIT's ability to qualify as a REIT depends in particular upon whether each of the Leases is respected as a lease for federal income tax purposes. If one or more Leases are not respected as leases for federal income tax purposes, Host REIT may fail to qualify as a REIT. The determination of whether the Leases are leases for federal income tax purposes is highly dependent on specific facts and circumstances. In addition, for the rents payable under a Lease to qualify as "rents from real property" under the Internal Revenue Code, the rental provisions of the Leases and the other terms thereof must conform with normal business practice and not be used as a means to base the rent paid on the income or profits of the lessees. In delivering the opinions set forth above that Host REIT's organization and method of operation (as described in the Representation Letter) have enabled Host REIT to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for each of its taxable years ended December 31, 1999, through and including December 31, 2008, and that Host REIT's current organization and current and intended method of operation will enable Host REIT to meet such requirements for the current taxable year and subsequent taxable years, we expressly rely upon, among other things, Host REIT's representations as to various factual matters with respect to the Leases, including representations as to the commercial reasonableness of the economic and other terms of the Leases at the times the Leases were originally entered into and subsequently renewed or extended (and taking into account for this purpose changes to the economic and other terms of the Leases pursuant to subsequent amendments), the intent and economic expectations of the parties to the Leases, the allocation of various economic risks between the parties to the Leases, taking into account all surrounding facts and circumstances, the conformity of the rental provisions and other terms of the Leases with normal business practice, the conduct of the parties to the Leases, and the conclusion that, except in connection with the Harbor Beach Lease and any other leases that Host REIT acknowledges will not qualify as producing "rents from real property" under the Internal Revenue Code, such terms are not being, and will not be, used as a means to base the
April 27, 2009
Page 7
 
rent paid on the income or profits of the Lessees. We express no opinion as to any of the economic terms of the Leases, the commercial reasonableness thereof, or whether the actual economic relationships created thereby are such that the Leases will be respected for federal income tax purposes or whether the rental and other terms of the Leases conform with normal business practice (and are not being used as a means to base the rent paid on the income or profits of the Lessees).
Host REIT's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon Host REIT's ability to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under the Internal Revenue Code, which are described (or incorporated by reference) in the Prospectus Supplement. We have relied upon representations of Host REIT and Host LP with respect to these matters (including those set forth or incorporated by reference, in the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and in the Representation Letter) and will not review Host REIT's compliance with these requirements on a continuing basis. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of Host REIT's operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements under the Internal Revenue Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
For a discussion relating the law to the facts, and the legal analysis underlying the opinions set forth in this letter, we incorporate by reference the Tax Disclosure (which is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus Supplement).
This opinion letter addresses only the specific federal income tax matters set forth above and does not address any other federal, state, local or foreign tax issues. In the event any one of the statements, representations, warranties or assumptions upon which we have relied to issue either of our opinions is incorrect, such opinion might be adversely affected and may not be relied upon. We assume no obligation by reason of this opinion letter to advise you of any changes in either of our opinions subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter.
This opinion letter has been prepared in connection with the Offering pursuant to the Registration Statement. This opinion letter should not be relied upon by any person other than you or for any other purpose.
