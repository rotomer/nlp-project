On May 11, 2009, Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. ("Host L.P."), for whom Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. ("Host REIT") acts as sole general partner, issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of Series T senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 9% per year due in 2017. The notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears. The notes were offered in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The text of the news release issued in connection with the sale of the Series T senior notes is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.
Optional Redemption Provisions and Change of Control Repurchase Right
At any time prior to May 15, 2013, the Series T senior notes will be redeemable at Host L.P.'s option, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. Beginning May 15, 2013, Host L.P. may redeem, in whole or in part, the Series T senior notes at any time subject to the payment of a redemption price together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The redemption price includes a call premium that varies (from 4.5% to 0%) depending on the year of redemption.
Prior to May 15, 2012, Host L.P. may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Series T senior notes at a redemption price equal to 109% of the principal amount thereof, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of sales of equity securities by Host L.P. or Host REIT.
The holders of Series T senior notes will also have the right to require Host L.P. to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering event, as defined in the senior notes indenture, at an offer price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
Ranking and Security
The notes were issued pursuant to a supplement to Host L.P.'s Amended and Restated Indenture, dated August 5, 1998, originally among HMH Properties, Inc. (now, Host L.P.), the subsidiary guarantors named therein, and HSBC Bank USA f/k/a Marine Midland Bank (now succeeded by The Bank of New York Mellon), as trustee. Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, the senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.'s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P., subject to certain limitations set forth in the senior notes indenture. The senior notes are guaranteed by certain of Host L.P.'s subsidiaries and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in certain of Host L.P.'s subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under Host L.P.'s senior notes indenture, as well as Host L.P.'s credit facility and certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility.
Restrictive Covenants
Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, Host L.P.'s ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x by Host L.P. (1.7x in the case of distributions to enable Host REIT to pay dividends on its preferred stock). This ratio is calculated in accordance with Host L.P.'s senior notes indenture and excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.'s consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on Host L.P.'s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.'s ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using un-depreciated real estate values) and secured indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may make distributions and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture. There are exceptions permitting distributions by Host L.P. to Host REIT, and other holders of partnership interests, that are necessary for Host REIT to pay dividends required to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust, even when Host L.P. does not meet the financial covenant tests set forth above.
The senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters, such as limitations on the capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, and transactions with affiliates and the incurrence of liens.
Use of Proceeds
The net proceeds of the offering will be used to repay all of the outstanding $135 million mortgage debt on The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa in 2009, to repay the $200 million currently outstanding on the revolving portion of Host L.P.'s credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
Forward-Looking Statements
The discussion in this report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project," "will," "continue" and other similar terms and phrases, including references to assumption and forecasts of future results. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made. These risks include, but are not limited to: national and local economic and business conditions, including the potential for terrorist attacks, that will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services; operating risks associated with the hotel business; risks associated with the level of our indebtedness and our ability to meet covenants in our debt agreements; relationships with property managers; our ability to maintain our properties in a first-class manner, including meeting capital expenditure requirements; our ability to compete effectively in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate structures; changes in travel patterns, taxes and government regulations which influence or determine wages, prices, construction procedures and costs; our ability to complete acquisitions and dispositions; and our ability to continue to satisfy complex rules in order for Host REIT to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described in our filings with the SEC. Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that any deviation will not be material.

(2) used to repay and permanently reduce Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility (including that, in the case of a revolver or similar arrangement, such commitment is permanently reduced by such amount).
Pending the application of any such Net Cash Proceeds as described above, the Company may invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not or were not applied or invested as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph (including any Net Cash Proceeds which were committed to be invested as provided in such sentence but which are not in fact invested within the time period provided) will be deemed to constitute
"Excess Proceeds."
Within 30 days following each date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25 million, the Company will make an offer to purchase from the holders of the notes and holders of any of other Indebtedness of the Company ranking pari passu with the Securities from time to time outstanding with similar provisions requiring the Company to make an offer to purchase or redeem such Indebtedness with the proceeds from such Asset Sale, on a pro rata basis, an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Securities and such other Indebtedness equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date, at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Securities and such other Indebtedness, plus, in each case, accrued interest (if any) to the Payment Date. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Securities and other senior Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Securities and such other Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Securities to be purchased and such other Indebtedness shall be selected on a basis. Upon completion of such Offer to Purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
pro rata
Notwithstanding, and without complying with, any of the foregoing provisions:
(1) the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and its and their respective Restricted Subsidiaries may, in the ordinary course of business, convey, sell, lease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of inventory acquired and held for resale in the ordinary course of business;
 
(2) the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and its and their respective Restricted Subsidiaries may convey, sell, lease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of assets pursuant to and in accordance with Article 5 and Section 4.13 of the Indenture;
(3) the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and its and their respective Restricted Subsidiaries may sell or dispose of damaged, worn out or other obsolete property in the ordinary course of business so long as such property is no longer necessary for the proper conduct of the business of the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable; and
(4) the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors its and their respective Restricted Subsidiaries may exchange assets held by the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary for one or more real estate properties and/or one or more Related Businesses of any Person or entity owning one or more real estate properties and/or one or more Related Businesses; that the Board of the Company has determined in good faith that the fair market value of the assets received by the Company are approximately equal to the fair market value of the assets exchanged by the Company.
provided
No transaction listed in clauses (1) through (4) inclusive shall be deemed to be an "Asset Sale."

Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successors under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate of 9% per annum from May 11, 2009 until maturity. To the extent it is lawful, the Company promises to pay interest on any interest payment due but unpaid on such principal amount at a rate of 9% per annum compounded semi-annually.
The Company will pay interest semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing July 15, 2009. Interest on the 9% Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid on the Securities, from the date of the original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
The Company shall pay interest on the 9% Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are the registered Holders at the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 9% Securities will be payable in United States Dollars at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York or at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the 9% Securities at the addresses set forth upon the registry books of the Company;

immediately available funds, if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not fewer than 15 days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date. Such wire instructions, upon receipt by the Trustee, shall remain in effect until revoked by such Holder. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Initially, The Bank of New York Mellon will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar without notice to the Holders. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may, subject to certain exceptions, act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar.
 
The Company issued the 9% Securities and the Subsidiary Guarantors issued their Guarantees under an Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of August 5, 1998, as supplemented (the "Indenture"), between the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. The 9% Securities are unlimited in aggregate principal amount. The terms of the 9% Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as in effect on the date of the Indenture. The 9% Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders of 9% Securities are referred to the Indenture and said Act for a statement of them. The Securities are senior, general obligations of the Company, secured initially by a pledge of Capital Stock of certain Subsidiaries of the Company, which pledge is shared equally and ratably with the Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Notes and certain existing and future Indebtedness of the Company ranking
pari passu
with the Securities. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by the provisions of the Indenture, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be provided in the Indenture and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for such purpose.
 
At any time prior to May 15, 2013 upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Company may redeem the 9% Securities in whole or in part at any time at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Make-Whole Premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date Notice of a redemption of the 9% Securities made pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be given in the manner set forth in Section 3.3 of the Indenture;
provided however
, that any such notice need not set forth the Redemption Price but need only set forth the calculation thereof as described in the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph 5. The Redemption Price, calculated as aforesaid, shall be set forth in an Officer's Certificate delivered by the Company to the Trustee no later than one Business Day prior to the Redemption Date.
 
At any time on or after May 15, 2013, upon not less than 30 days' notice nor more than 60 days' notice, the Company may redeem the 9% Securities for cash at its option, in whole or in part, at the following Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount) if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing May 15 of the years indicated below, in each case, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the applicable Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date that is on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date):
 
Prior to May 15, 2012, the Company may redeem from time to time up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 9% Securities outstanding at a Redemption Price equal to 109.000% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date that is on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date) with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided, that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the 9% Securities originally issued on the Series Issue Date remain outstanding after such redemption; and provided, further, that such redemption shall occur within 90 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering is consummated.
The Company is not prohibited from acquiring the 9% Securities by means other than a redemption, whether pursuant to an issuer tender offer, in open market transactions, or otherwise, assuming such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture.
The 9% Securities will not have the benefit of a sinking fund.
 
The 9% Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may register the transfer of, or exchange 9% Securities in accordance with, the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any 9% Securities (a) selected for redemption except the unredeemed portion of any 9% Security being redeemed in part or (b) for a period beginning 15 Business Days before the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase or redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing.
 
The registered Holder of a 9% Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent(s) will pay the money back to the Company at its written request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and such Paying Agent(s) with respect to such money shall cease.
 
Except as set forth in the Indenture, if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such 9% Securities on the stated date for payment thereof or on the redemption date of such principal or installment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such 9% Securities, the Company will be discharged from certain provisions of the Indenture and the 9% Securities (including the restrictive covenants described in paragraph 11 below, but excluding its obligation to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 9% Securities). Upon satisfaction of certain additional conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Company may elect to have its obligations and the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors discharged with respect to outstanding 9% Securities.
 
The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may enter into a supplemental indenture for certain limited purposes without the consent of the Holders. Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the 9% Securities may be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 9% Securities then outstanding (except that any amendments or supplements to the provisions relating to security interests or with respect to the Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall require the consent of the holders of not less than 66

/
3
% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 9% Securities then outstanding. Without notice to or consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may under certain circumstances amend or supplement the Indenture or the 9% Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of a 9% Security.
 
The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and any of their respective Restricted Subsidiaries to, among other
 
things, incur additional Indebtedness and issue Disqualified Stock, pay dividends or make certain other Restricted Payments, enter into certain transactions with Affiliates, incur Liens, sell assets and subsidiary stock, merge or consolidate with any other Person or transfer (by lease, assignment or otherwise) substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company. The limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and certain restrictive covenants will cease to be applicable under certain circumstances. The Company must periodically report to the Trustee on compliance with such limitations.
 
(a) If there is a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company shall be required to offer irrevocably to purchase on the Change of Control Purchase Date all outstanding 9% Securities at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus (subject to the right of Holders of record on a Record Date that is on or prior to such Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on the Interest Payment Date to which such Record Date relates) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Change of Control Purchase Date. Holders of 9% Securities will receive a Change of Control Offer from the Company prior to any related Change of Control Purchase Date and may elect to have such 9% Securities purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" appearing below.
(b) The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under paragraph 5, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.
(c) The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any of their respective Restricted Subsidiaries to sell assets and subsidiary stock. In the event the Net Cash Proceeds from a permitted Asset Sale exceed certain amounts, as specified in the Indenture, the Company will be required either to reinvest the proceeds of such Asset Sale in a Related Business or other permitted investments, repay certain Indebtedness or to make an offer to purchase each Holder's 9% Securities at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, to the purchase date. The limitations and the Company's obligations with respect to the use of proceeds from an Asset Sale are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and will cease to be applicable under certain circumstances.
 
As set forth more fully in the Indenture, the Persons constituting Subsidiary Guarantors from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, irrevocably and unconditionally and jointly and severally guarantee, in accordance with
 
Section 12.1 of the Indenture, to the Holders and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, that (i) the principal of and interest on the 9% Securities will be paid, whether at the Stated Maturity or Interest Payment Dates, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee under the Indenture or this 9% Security will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and this 9% Security, and (ii) in the case of any extension of payment or renewal of this 9% Security or any of such other obligations, they will be paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal, whether at the Stated Maturity, as so extended, by acceleration or otherwise. Such Guarantees shall cease to apply, and shall be null and void, with respect to any such guarantor who, pursuant to Article 12 of the Indenture, is released from its Guarantees, or whose Guarantees otherwise cease to be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.
 
When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the 9% Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from those obligations.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the 9% Securities occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of Default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company), then either the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 9% Securities then outstanding may declare all 9% Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Holders of 9% Securities may not enforce the Indenture or the 9% Securities, except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the 9% Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding 9% Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power with respect to such 9% Securities. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of 9% Securities notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.
 
The Trustee and each Agent under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with such Persons as if it were not the Trustee or such agent.
 
No recourse for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 9% Securities or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors in the Indenture, or in the 9% Securities or because of the creation
 
of any Indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, partner, stockholder, officer, director, employee or controlling Person of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors or of any successor Person thereof, except as an obligor or guarantor of the 9% Securities pursuant to the Indenture.
