Exhibit 8.1
Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.
6903 Rockledge Drive
Suite 1500
Bethesda, Maryland 20817
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This firm has acted as special tax counsel to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Host REIT"), and Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Host LP"), in connection with the issuance, under certain circumstances, of up to 16,831,794 shares of our common stock upon the exchange of the 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Debentures issued by Host LP in 2007 and due in 2027 (the "Offering"), as described in greater detail in the Prospectus Supplement, dated June 10, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement") to Host REIT's prospectus dated April 29, 2010 (the "Prospectus") that was part of the automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 ASR (File No. 333-166380) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29, 2010 (the "Registration Statement").
In connection with the Offering, we have been asked to provide to you the legal opinions set forth herein regarding certain federal income tax matters related to Host REIT. Capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise defined in the body of this letter, shall have the meanings set forth in .
Appendix A
Bases for Opinions
The opinions set forth in this letter are based on relevant current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"), Treasury Regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which may or may not be retroactive in effect and that might result in material modifications of one or both of our opinions. Our opinions do not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel's best
June 10, 2011
Page 2
 
professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS.
In rendering the following opinions, we have examined such statutes, regulations, records, agreements, certificates and other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions, including, but not limited to, the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
June 10, 2011

The opinions set forth in this letter are also premised on certain written factual representations of Host REIT and Host LP regarding the organization, ownership and operations (including the income, assets, businesses, liabilities, properties and accumulated undistributed earnings and profits) of Host REIT, Host LP, the Partnership Subsidiaries, the Non-Controlled Subsidiaries, the Taxable REIT Subsidiaries, the Subsidiary REITs, the Host Employee/Charitable Trust, Crestline, and the Lessees, contained in a letter to us dated as of the date hereof (the "Representation Letter").
For purposes of rendering our opinions, although we have knowledge as to certain of the facts set forth in the above-referenced documents, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in such documents, including the Registration Statement (including the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement) and the Representation Letter. We consequently have relied upon the representations as to factual matters in such documents and assumed that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us is accurate and complete in all material respects.

In this regard, we have assumed or obtained representations regarding (and, with your consent, are relying upon) the following:

Opinions
Based upon, subject to, and limited by the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein (including those set forth below), we are of the opinion that:
 
 
Host REIT's ability to qualify as a REIT depends in particular upon whether each of the Leases is respected as a lease for federal income tax purposes. If one or more Leases are not respected as leases for federal income tax purposes, Host REIT may fail to qualify as a REIT. The determination of whether the Leases are leases for federal income tax purposes is highly dependent on specific facts and circumstances. In addition, for the rents payable under a Lease to qualify as "rents from real property" under the Internal Revenue Code, the rental provisions of the Leases and the other terms thereof must conform with normal business practice and not be used as a means to base the rent paid on the income or profits of the lessees. In delivering the first opinion set forth above, we expressly rely upon, among other things, Host REIT's representations as to various factual matters with respect to the Leases, including representations as to the commercial reasonableness of the economic and other terms of the Leases at the times the Leases were originally entered into and subsequently renewed or extended (and taking into account for this purpose changes to the economic and other terms of the Leases pursuant to subsequent amendments), the intent and economic expectations of the parties to the Leases, the allocation of various economic risks between the parties to the Leases, taking into account all surrounding facts and circumstances, the conformity of the rental provisions and other terms of the Leases with normal business practice, the conduct of the parties to the Leases, and the conclusion that, except in connection with the Harbor Beach Lease and any other leases that Host REIT acknowledges will not qualify as producing "rents from real property" under the Internal Revenue Code, such terms are not being, and will not be, used as a means to base the rent paid on the income or profits of the Lessees. We express no opinion as to any of the economic terms of the Leases, the commercial reasonableness thereof, or whether the actual economic relationships created thereby are such that the Leases will be respected for federal income tax purposes or whether the rental and other terms of the Leases conform with normal business practice (and are not being used as a means to base the rent paid on the income or profits of the Lessees).
Host REIT's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon Host REIT's ability to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under the Internal Revenue Code, which are described in the Tax Disclosure and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus Supplement. We have relied upon representations of Host REIT and Host LP with respect to these
June 10, 2011
Page 6
 
matters (including those set forth in the Representation Letter, or set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, including the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement) and will not review Host REIT's compliance with these requirements on a continuing basis. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of Host REIT's operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements under the Internal Revenue Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
For a discussion relating the law to the facts, and the legal analysis underlying the opinions set forth in this letter, we incorporate by reference the Tax Disclosure.
This opinion letter addresses only the specific federal income tax matters set forth above and does not address any other federal, state, local or foreign tax issues. In the event any one of the statements, representations, warranties or assumptions upon which we have relied to issue either of our opinions is incorrect, such opinion might be adversely affected and may not be relied upon. We assume no obligation by reason of this opinion letter to advise you of any changes in either of our opinions subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter.
This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with the Offering. This opinion letter should not be relied upon by any person other than you or for any other purpose.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 8.1 to the Registration Statement and to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are an "expert" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
