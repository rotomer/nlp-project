Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
The information required by this item is included in Item 2.03 below and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On November 18, 2011, Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. ("Host L.P."), for whom Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. ("Host REIT") acts as sole general partner, issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of Series Y senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 6% per year due in 2021. The notes were issued pursuant to a supplement to Host L.P.'s Amended and Restated Indenture, dated August 5, 1998, originally among HMH Properties, Inc. (now, Host L.P.), the subsidiary guarantors named therein, and HSBC Bank USA f/k/a Marine Midland Bank (now succeeded by The Bank of New York Mellon), as trustee (the "senior notes indenture"). The notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears. The notes were offered in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Optional Redemption Provisions and Change of Control Repurchase Right
At any time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Series Y senior notes will be redeemable at Host L.P.'s option, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date.
Host L.P. may also redeem the Series Y senior notes within the period beginning 90 days prior to October 1, 2021, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series Y senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable date of redemption.
The holders of Series Y senior notes will also have the right to require Host L.P. to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering event, as defined in the senior notes indenture, at an offer price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
Ranking and Security
Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, the senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.'s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P., subject to certain limitations set forth in the senior notes indenture. The senior notes are guaranteed by certain of Host L.P.'s subsidiaries and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in certain of Host L.P.'s subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under Host L.P.'s senior notes indenture, as well as Host L.P.'s credit facility and certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. In the event that Host L.P. completes the refinancing of its existing credit facility as described on the combined Current Report of Host REIT and Host L.P. on Form 8-K filed on November 14, 2011 (Item 8.01  Negotiation of amended and restated credit facility), it is expected that all guarantees provided by Host L.P.'s subsidiaries and the pledges of the common equity interests of Host L.P.'s subsidiaries securing the Series Y senior notes and Host L.P.'s other outstanding senior notes will be automatically and unconditionally released. Host L.P.'s new credit facility is not expected to initially include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests, and the guarantees and pledges are expected to be required only in the event that Host L.P.'s leverage ratio later exceeds 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that Host L.P. does not have an investment grade long-term unsecured debt rating. In the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered, the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the new credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under Host L.P.'s senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the new credit facility.
Restrictive Covenants
Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, Host L.P.'s ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x by Host L.P. (1.7x in the case of distributions to enable Host REIT to pay
dividends on any preferred stock). This ratio is calculated in accordance with Host L.P.'s senior notes indenture and excludes from interest expense items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges, and non-cash interest expense recorded as a result of the adoption of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on Host L.P.'s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.'s ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate values) and secured indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may make distributions and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture. There are exceptions permitting distributions by Host L.P. to Host REIT, and other holders of partnership interests, that are necessary for Host REIT to pay dividends required to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust, even when Host L.P. does not meet the financial covenant tests set forth above.
The senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters, such as limitations on capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, and transactions with affiliates and the incurrence of liens.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the issuance of the Series Y senior notes, Host L.P. also entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of November 18, 2011 (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), under which Host L.P. agreed, pursuant to customary terms, to make an offer to exchange the Series Y senior notes for registered, publicly tradable notes that have substantially identical terms to the Series Y senior notes. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, Host L.P. also agreed, in certain limited circumstances, to file a shelf registration statement that would allow certain holders of the Series Y senior notes to resell their respective notes to the public.
Use of Proceeds
Host L.P. intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Series Y senior notes, along with available cash and borrowings under Host L.P.'s credit facility, to repurchase or repay $421 million face amount of Host L.P.'s 2 5/8% exchangeable senior debentures due 2027, which holders have the right to put to Host L.P. on April 15, 2012.

In the event that the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantors or such Restricted Subsidiaries from one or more Asset Sales occurring on or after the Closing Date in any period of 12 consecutive months (such 12 consecutive month period, an "Asset Sale Period") exceed 5% of Total Assets (determined as of the date closest to the commencement of such Asset Sale Period for which a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or provided to the trustee pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Indenture), then during the period commencing 180 days prior to the commencement of such Asset Sale Period and running through the date that is 12 months after the date Net Cash Proceeds so received exceeded 5% of Total Assets, an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds received during such Asset Sale Period must have been or must be:

(2) used to repay and permanently reduce Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility (including that, in the case of a revolver or similar arrangement, such commitment is permanently reduced by such amount).
 
Pending the application of any such Net Cash Proceeds as described above, the Company may invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not or were not applied or invested as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph (including any Net Cash Proceeds which were committed to be invested as provided in such sentence but which are not in fact invested within the time period provided) will be deemed to constitute
"Excess Proceeds."
Within 30 days following each date on which the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25 million, the Company will make an offer to purchase from the Holders of the 6% Notes and holders of any of other Indebtedness of the Company ranking pari passu with the Securities from time to time outstanding with similar provisions requiring the Company to make an offer to purchase or redeem such Indebtedness with the proceeds from such Asset Sale, on a pro rata basis, an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Securities and such other Indebtedness equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date, at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Securities and such other Indebtedness, plus, in each case, accrued interest (if any) to the Payment Date. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Securities and other senior Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Securities and such other Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Securities to be purchased and such other Indebtedness shall be selected on a basis. Upon completion of such Offer to Purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successors under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate of 6% per annum from November 18, 2011 until maturity. To the extent it is lawful, the Company promises to pay interest on any interest payment due but unpaid on such principal amount at a rate of 6% per annum compounded semi-annually.
The Company will pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing April 1, 2012. Interest on the 6% Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid on the Securities, from the date of the original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
The Company shall pay interest on the 6% Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are the registered Holders at the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 6% Securities will be payable in United States Dollars at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York or at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of the 6% Securities at the addresses set forth upon the registry books of the Company;
provided
,
however
, Holders of Global Securities will be entitled to receive interest payments (other than at maturity) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not fewer than 15 days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date. Such wire instructions, upon receipt by the Trustee, shall remain in effect until revoked by such Holder. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
 
Initially, The Bank of New York Mellon will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar without notice to the Holders. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may, subject to certain exceptions, act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar.
 
The Company issued the 6% Securities and the Subsidiary Guarantors issued their Guarantees under an Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of August 5, 1998, as supplemented (the "Indenture"), between the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. The 6% Securities are unlimited in aggregate principal amount. The terms of the 6% Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as in effect on the date of the Indenture. The 6% Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders of 6% Securities are referred to the Indenture and said Act for a statement of them. The Securities are senior, general obligations of the Company, secured initially by a pledge of Capital Stock of certain Subsidiaries of the Company, which pledge is shared equally and ratably with the Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Notes and certain existing and future Indebtedness of the Company ranking
pari
passu
with the Securities. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by the provisions of the Indenture, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be provided in the Indenture and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for such purpose.
 
At any time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Company may redeem the 6% Securities in whole or in part at any time at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Make-Whole Premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date. Notice of a redemption of the 6% Securities made pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be given in the manner set forth in Section 3.3 of the Indenture;
provided
however
, that any such notice need not set forth the Redemption Price but need only set forth the calculation thereof as described in the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph 5. The Redemption Price, calculated as aforesaid, shall be set forth in an Officer's Certificate delivered by the Company to the Trustee no later than one Business Day prior to the Redemption Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, within the period beginning 90 days prior to their Stated Maturity, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Company may redeem the 6% Securities in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of
 
the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date that is on or prior to the applicable Redemption Date).
The Company is not prohibited from acquiring the 6% Securities by means other than a redemption, whether pursuant to an issuer tender offer, in open market transactions, or otherwise, assuming such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture.
The 6% Securities will not have the benefit of a sinking fund.
 
The 6% Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may register the transfer of, or exchange 6% Securities in accordance with, the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any 6% Securities (a) selected for redemption except the unredeemed portion of any 6% Security being redeemed in part or (b) for a period beginning 15 Business Days before the mailing of a notice of an offer to repurchase or redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing.
 
The registered Holder of a 6% Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent(s) will pay the money back to the Company at its written request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and such Paying Agent(s) with respect to such money shall cease.
 
Except as set forth in the Indenture, if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such 6% Securities on the stated date for payment thereof or on the redemption date of such principal or installment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such 6% Securities, the Company will be discharged from certain provisions of the Indenture and the 6% Securities (including the restrictive covenants described in paragraph 11 below, but excluding its obligation to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 6% Securities). Upon satisfaction of certain additional conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Company may elect to have its obligations and the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors discharged with respect to outstanding 6% Securities.
 
The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may enter into a supplemental indenture for certain limited purposes without the consent of the Holders. Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the 6% Securities may be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 6% Securities then outstanding (except that any amendments or supplements to the provisions relating to security interests or with respect to the Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall require the consent of the holders of not less than 66

/

% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 6% Securities then outstanding. Without notice to or consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may under certain circumstances amend or supplement the Indenture or the 6% Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of a 6% Security.
 
The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and any of their respective Restricted Subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional Indebtedness and issue Disqualified Stock, pay dividends or make certain other Restricted Payments, enter into certain transactions with Affiliates, incur Liens, sell assets and subsidiary stock, merge or consolidate with any other Person or transfer (by lease, assignment or otherwise) substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company. The limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and certain restrictive covenants will cease to be applicable under certain circumstances. The Company must periodically report to the Trustee on compliance with such limitations.
 
(a) If there is a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company shall be required to offer irrevocably to purchase on the Change of Control Purchase Date all outstanding 6% Securities at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus (subject to the right of Holders of record on a Record Date that is on or prior to such Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on the Interest Payment Date to which such Record Date relates) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Change of Control Purchase Date. Holders of 6% Securities will receive a Change of Control Offer from the Company prior to any related Change of Control Purchase Date and may elect to have such 6% Securities purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" appearing below.
 
(b) The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under paragraph 5, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.
(c) The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any of their respective Restricted Subsidiaries to sell assets and subsidiary stock. In the event the Net Cash Proceeds from a permitted Asset Sale exceed certain amounts, as specified in the Indenture, the Company will be required either to reinvest the proceeds of such Asset Sale in a Related Business or other permitted investments, repay certain Indebtedness or to make an offer to purchase each Holder's 6% Securities at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, to the purchase date. The limitations and the Company's obligations with respect to the use of proceeds from an Asset Sale are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and will cease to be applicable under certain circumstances.
 
As set forth more fully in the Indenture, the Persons constituting Subsidiary Guarantors from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, irrevocably and unconditionally and jointly and severally guarantee, in accordance with Section 12.1 of the Indenture, to the Holders and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, that (i) the principal of and interest on the 6% Securities will be paid, whether at the Stated Maturity or Interest Payment Dates, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee under the Indenture or this 6% Security will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and this 6% Security, and (ii) in the case of any extension of payment or renewal of this 6% Security or any of such other obligations, they will be paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal, whether at the Stated Maturity, as so extended, by acceleration or otherwise. Such Guarantees shall cease to apply, and shall be null and void, with respect to any such guarantor who, pursuant to Article 12 of the Indenture, is released from its Guarantees, or whose Guarantees otherwise cease to be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.
 
When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the 6% Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from those obligations.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the 6% Securities occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of Default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
 
reorganization of the Company), then either the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 6% Securities then outstanding may declare all 6% Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Holders of 6% Securities may not enforce the Indenture or the 6% Securities, except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the 6% Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding 6% Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power with respect to such 6% Securities. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of 6% Securities notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.
 
The Trustee and each Agent under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with such Persons as if it were not the Trustee or such agent.
 
No recourse for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 6% Securities or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors in the Indenture, or in the 6% Securities or because of the creation of any Indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, partner, stockholder, officer, director, employee or controlling Person of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors or of any successor Person thereof, except as an obligor or guarantor of the 6% Securities pursuant to the Indenture. Each Holder, by accepting the 6% Securities, waives and releases all such liability.
 
This 6% Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or authenticating agent signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this 6% Security.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a 6% Security or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company will cause CUSIP numbers to be printed
 
on the 6% Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the 6% Securities. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the 6% Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.
 
In addition to the rights provided to Holders of 6% Securities under the Indenture, Holders of Transfer Restricted Notes shall have all the rights set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of the date of the Forty-First Supplemental Indenture, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers.
 
THE INDENTURE AND THE 6% SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW AND NEW YORK CIVIL PRACTICE LAWS AND RULES 327(b).

We will, and we will inform each subsequent purchaser that such subsequent purchaser is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser from it as to the resale restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence.
3. We understand that, on any proposed resale of the Securities or beneficial interest therein, we will be required to furnish to you and the Company such certifications, legal opinions and other information as you and the Company may reasonably require to confirm that the proposed sale complies with the foregoing restrictions. We further understand that the Securities purchased by us will bear a legend to the foregoing effect.
4. We are an institutional "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act) and have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of our investment in the Securities, and we and any accounts for which we are acting are each able to bear the economic risk of our or its investment. We are also a "qualified person" as defined above.
5. We are acquiring the Securities or beneficial interest therein purchased by us for our own account or for one or more accounts (each of which is an institutional "accredited investor") as to each of which we exercise sole investment discretion.
You and the Company are entitled to rely upon this letter and are irrevocably authorized to produce this letter or a copy hereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal proceedings or official inquiry with respect to the matters covered hereby.

(a) The Issuer and the Guarantors agree to use their reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than the Filing Date, an offer to exchange (the "Exchange Offer") any and all of the Transfer Restricted Securities for a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities of the Issuer and the Guarantors which are substantially identical to the Securities, except that the identity of the Guarantors may be different from those Subsidiary Guarantors that initially guaranteed the Securities pursuant to the Indenture so long as the Securities are at all times guaranteed in compliance with the Indenture (the "Exchange Securities") (and which are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture or a trust indenture which is identical to the Indenture (other than such changes to the
 
Execution Version
 
Indenture or any such identical trust indenture as are necessary to comply with any requirements of the SEC to effect or maintain the qualification thereof under the TIA) and which, in either case, has been qualified under the TIA), except that the Exchange Securities shall have been registered pursuant to an effective Registration Statement in compliance with the Securities Act. The Exchange Offer will be registered pursuant to the Securities Act on the appropriate form (the "Exchange Registration Statement") and will comply with all applicable tender offer rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act and shall be duly registered or qualified pursuant to all applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws. The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any condition, other than that the Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law or interpretation of the Staff of the SEC. No securities shall be included in the Registration Statement covering the Exchange Offer other than the Transfer Restricted Securities and the Exchange Securities. The Issuer and the Guarantors agree to use their reasonable best efforts to (x) cause the Exchange Registration Statement to become effective pursuant to the Securities Act on or before the Effectiveness Target Date; (y) keep the Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 Business Days (or such longer period required by applicable law) after the date that the notice of the Exchange Offer referred to below is sent to Holders; and (z) consummate the Exchange Offer within 290 days after the Closing Date. Each Holder who participates in the Exchange Offer will be required to represent that any Exchange Securities received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, that at the time of the consummation of the Exchange Offer such Holder will have no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Securities, and that such Holder is not an affiliate of the Issuer within the meaning of Rule 405 of the Securities Act (or that if it is such an affiliate, it will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable). Each Holder that is not a Participating Broker-Dealer will be required to represent that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of the Exchange Securities. Each Holder that is a Participating Broker-Dealer will be required to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus as required by law in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. Upon consummation of the Exchange Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall have no further obligation to register Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement.
(b) The Issuer and the Guarantors shall include within the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Registration Statement a section entitled "Plan of Distribution," reasonably acceptable to the Purchasers, which shall contain a summary statement of the positions taken or policies made by the Staff of the SEC with respect to the potential "underwriter" status of any broker-dealer that is the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of Exchange
 
Execution Version
 
Securities received by such broker-dealer in the Exchange Offer (a "Participating Broker-Dealer"). Such "Plan of Distribution" section shall also allow the use of the Prospectus by all persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, including all Participating Broker-Dealers, and include a statement describing the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities.
The Issuer and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to keep the Exchange Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the Prospectus contained therein, in order to permit such Prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such period of time as such persons must comply with such requirements in order to resell the Exchange Securities; that such period shall not exceed 180 days after consummation of the Exchange Offer (or such longer period if extended pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 5) (the "Applicable Period").
provided
In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Issuer shall:
(a) deliver as promptly as practicable to each Holder a copy of the prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents;
(b) utilize the services of a Depositary for the Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York; and
(c) permit Holders to withdraw tendered Securities at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last Business Day on which the Exchange Offer shall remain open.
As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange Offer, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall:
(i) accept for exchange all Securities properly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer;
(ii) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Securities so accepted for exchange; and
 
Execution Version
 
(iii) cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of Securities, Exchange Securities equal in principal amount to the Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange.
(c) If (1) prior to the consummation of the Exchange Offer, applicable interpretations of the Staff of the SEC do not permit the Issuer and the Guarantors to effect the Exchange Offer as contemplated herein, or (2) the Exchange Offer is commenced and not consummated within 290 days of the Closing Date for any reason, then the Issuer shall promptly deliver to the Holders and the Trustee written notice thereof (the "Shelf Notice") and the Issuer and the Guarantors shall file a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 3. Following the delivery of a Shelf Notice to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall not have any further obligation to conduct the Exchange Offer pursuant to this Section 2, that the Issuers and the Guarantors shall have the right, nonetheless, to proceed to consummate the Exchange Offer notwithstanding their obligations pursuant to this Section 2(c) (and, upon such consummation, their obligation to consummate a Shelf Registration shall terminate).
provided
 
If a Shelf Notice is delivered as contemplated by Section 2(c), then:
(a) . The Issuer and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable following the delivery of the Shelf Notice, a Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of the Transfer Restricted Securities (the "Shelf Registration"). The Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-1 or another appropriate form permitting registration of such Transfer Restricted Securities for resale by the Holders in the manner or manners reasonably designated by them (including, without limitation, one or more underwritten offerings). The Issuer and the Guarantors shall not permit any securities other than the Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in the Shelf Registration. The Issuer and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts, as described in Section 5(b), to cause the Shelf Registration to be declared effective pursuant to the Securities Act as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof and to keep the Shelf Registration continuously effective under the Securities Act until the date which is 24 months from the Closing Date, or such shorter period ending when either (1) all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration have been sold in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Shelf Registration or (2) there ceases to be outstanding any Transfer Restricted Securities (the "Effectiveness Period").
Shelf Registration
 
Execution Version
 
(b) . The Issuer and the Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective by supplementing and amending the Shelf Registration if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used for such Shelf Registration, if required by the Securities Act, or if reasonably requested by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement or by any underwriter of such Transfer Restricted Securities.
Supplements and Amendments
 
(a) The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Purchasers agree that the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities will suffer damages if the Issuer or the Guarantors fail to fulfill their obligations pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3 hereof and that it would not be possible to ascertain the extent of such damages. Accordingly, in the event of such failure by Issuer or the Guarantors to fulfill such obligations, the Issuer and the Guarantors hereby agree to pay liquidated damages ("Liquidated Damages") to each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities under the circumstances and to the extent set forth below:
(i) if neither the Exchange Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration has been filed with the SEC on or prior to the Filing Date; or
(ii) if neither the Exchange Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration is declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the Effectiveness Target Date; or
(iii) if an Exchange Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, on or prior to 290 days after the Closing Date and the Issuer and the Guarantors have not exchanged Exchange Securities for all Securities validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer; or
(iv) the Shelf Registration has been declared effective by the SEC and such Shelf Registration ceases to be effective or usable at any time during the Effectiveness Period, without being succeeded on the same day immediately by a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement that cures such failure and that is itself immediately declared effective on the same day;
 
Execution Version
 
(any of the foregoing, a "Registration Default") then, with respect to the first 90-day period following such Event Date (as defined below), the Issuer and the Guarantors shall pay to each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities Liquidated Damages in an amount equal to $.05 per week per $1,000 principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by such Holder for each week or portion thereof that the Registration Default continues. The amount of such Liquidated Damages will increase by an additional $.05 per week per $1,000 principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities with respect to each subsequent 90-day period until all Registration Defaults have been cured; , that Liquidated Damages shall not at any time exceed $.30 per week per $1,000 principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults relating to any Transfer Restricted Securities, the accrual of Liquidated Damages with respect to such Transfer Restricted Securities will cease. A Registration Default under clause (i) above shall be cured on the date that either the Exchange Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration is filed with the SEC; a Registration Default under clause (ii) above shall be cured on the date that either the Exchange Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration is declared effective by the SEC; a Registration Default under clause (iii) above shall be cured on the earlier of the date (A) the Exchange Offer is consummated or (B) the Issuer delivers a Shelf Notice to the Holders of Restricted Securities; and a Registration Default under clause (iv) above shall be cured on the earlier of (A) the date the Shelf Registration is declared effective or (B) the Effectiveness Period expires.
provided, however
(b) The Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Representatives within one Business Day after each and every date on which a Registration Default occurs (an "Event Date"). Liquidated Damages shall be paid by the Issuer and the Guarantors to the Holders by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by them or by mailing checks to their registered addresses if no such accounts have been specified on or before the semi-annual interest payment date provided in the Indenture (whether or not any interest is then payable on the Securities). Each obligation to pay Liquidated Damages shall be deemed to commence accruing on the applicable Event Date and to cease accruing when all Registration Defaults have been cured. In no event shall the Issuer pay Liquidated Damages in excess of the applicable maximum weekly amount set forth above, regardless of whether one or multiple Registration Defaults exist.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4, neither the issuance by the Issuer of a notice (i) of the type set forth in Section 5(c)(vii) declaring the Shelf Registration to be unusable during the pendency of the Material Activity (as defined in Section 5(c)(vii)) nor (ii) of the type set forth in Section 5(c)(ii),
 
Execution Version
 
5(c)(iii), 5(c)(iv), 5(c)(v) and 5(c)(vi), shall be deemed to be a Registration Default and no Liquidated Damages shall be payable or accrue with respect thereto; , that in the event the aggregate number of days in any consecutive twelve-month period for which all notices referenced above are issued and effective exceeds 30 days, then Liquidated Damages shall be payable in accordance with Sections 4(a) and 4(b) above for the number of such days in excess of 30 days in the aggregate.
provided
 
In connection with the registration of any Exchange Securities or Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Sections 2 or 3 hereof, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall effect such registration to permit the sale of such Exchange Securities or Transfer Restricted Securities (as applicable) in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the Issuer and the Guarantors shall:
(a) Prepare and file with the SEC, a Registration Statement or Registration Statements as prescribed by Section 2 or 3, and to use their reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; that, if (1) such filing is pursuant to Section 3, or (2) a Prospectus contained in an Exchange Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Securities during the Applicable Period, before filing any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the Issuer shall, if requested, furnish to and afford the Holders of the Transfer Restricted Securities and each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, covered by such Registration Statement, their counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, a reasonable opportunity to review copies of all such documents (including copies of any documents to be incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits thereto) proposed to be filed (at least 3 Business Days prior to such filing, or such later date as is reasonable under the circumstances). The Issuer and the Guarantors shall not file any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto in respect of which the Holders, pursuant to this Agreement, must be afforded an opportunity to review prior to the filing of such document, if the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement, or such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, their counsel, or the managing underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object.

of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in such Registration Statement and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities reasonably incurred in connection with the registration of the Transfer Restricted Securities.
 
The Issuer and the Guarantors agree to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each of the Purchasers, each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, each Holder of Exchange Securities, each Participating Broker-Dealer, (ii) each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act) any such Person (any of the persons referred to in this clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to as a "controlling person"), and (iii) the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of any of such Person or any controlling person (any person referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) may hereinafter be referred to as an "Indemnified Person") to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and expenses (including without limitation, and as incurred, reimbursement of all reasonable costs of investigating, preparing, pursuing or defending any claim or action, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to any Indemnified Person) directly or indirectly caused by, related to, based upon, arising out of or in connection with (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or caused by, arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Issuer shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by, arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Indemnified Person furnished to the Issuer or any underwriter in writing by such Indemnified Person expressly for use therein. The Issuer and the Guarantors shall notify the Holders promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any claim, proceeding (including any governmental investigation) or litigation of which it or they shall have become aware in connection with the matters addressed by this Agreement which involves the Issuer, any Guarantor or an Indemnified Person.
 
Execution Version
 
In connection with any Registration Statement in which an Indemnified Person is participating, such Indemnified Person agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, each Guarantor and their directors and officers and each person who controls the Issuer and the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuer and the Guarantors to each Indemnified Person, but only with reference to information relating to such Indemnified Person furnished to the Issuer in writing by such Indemnified Person expressly for use in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. The liability of any Indemnified Person pursuant to this paragraph shall in no event exceed the net proceeds received by such Indemnified Person from sales of Transfer Restricted Securities giving rise to such obligations.
If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying person") in writing, and the indemnifying person, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying person may reasonably designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses actually incurred by such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless (i) the indemnifying person and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying person failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying person, or any affiliate of the indemnifying person and such indemnified party shall have been reasonably advised by counsel that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying person or such affiliate of the indemnifying person or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying person or such affiliate of the indemnifying person (in which case the indemnifying person shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action

on behalf of such indemnified party), it being understood, however, that the indemnifying person shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by indemnified parties who sold a majority in interest of Transfer Restricted Securities sold by all such indemnified parties and any such separate firm for the Issuer and the Guarantors, their directors, their officers and such control persons of the Issuer and the Guarantors shall be designated in writing by the Issuer. The indemnifying person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying person agrees to indemnify any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying person shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an (i) unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
If the indemnification provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses referred to therein (other than by reason of the exceptions provided therein), then each indemnifying person under such paragraphs, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits of the indemnified party on the one hand and the indemnifying person(s) on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying person(s) and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Issuer and the Guarantors on the one hand and any Indemnified Persons on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer and the Guarantors or by such Indemnified Persons and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
Execution Version
 
The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if such indemnified parties were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses actually incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Indemnified Person be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which proceeds received by such Indemnified Person from sales of Transfer Restricted Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Indemnified Person has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 will be in addition to any liability which the indemnifying persons may otherwise have to the indemnified parties referred to above. The Indemnified Persons' obligations to contribute pursuant to Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities sold by each of the Indemnified Persons hereunder and not joint.
 
The Issuer and the Guarantors covenant that they will file the reports required to be filed by them pursuant to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder in a timely manner and, if at any time the Issuer and the Guarantors are not required to file such reports, they will, upon the request of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, make available information required by Rules 144 and 144A under the Securities Act in order to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144 and Rule 144A. The Issuer and the Guarantors further covenant that they will take such further action as any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Transfer Restricted Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 and Rule 144A under the Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.
 
Execution Version
 
(a) If any of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Transfer Restricted Securities included in such offering and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer.
No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder, unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
(b) Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, if requested (pursuant to a timely written notice) by the managing underwriters in an underwritten offering or placement agent in a private offering of the Issuer's or the Guarantors' debt securities, not to effect any private sale or distribution (including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 and Rule 144A, but excluding nonpublic sales to any of its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and controlling persons) of any of the Securities except pursuant to an Exchange Offer, during the period beginning 10 days prior to, and ending 90 days after, the closing date of the underwritten offering.
The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any holder of Transfer Restricted Securities if such holder is prevented by applicable statute or regulation from entering into any such agreement.
The Issuer and the Guarantors agree without the written consent of the managing underwriters in an underwritten offering of Transfer Restricted Securities covered by a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof, not to effect any public or private sale or distribution of its respective debt securities, including a sale pursuant to Regulation D or Rule 144A under the Securities Act, during the period beginning 10 days prior to, and ending 90 days after, the closing date of each underwritten offering made pursuant to such Registration Statement (, that such period shall be extended by the number of days from and including

the date of the giving of any notice pursuant to Section 5(c)(v) or (c)(vi) hereof to and including the date when each seller of Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5(j) hereof).
 
(a) . In the event of a breach by the Issuer of any of its obligations under this Agreement, each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein, in the Indenture or, in the case of the Purchasers, in the Purchase Agreement, or granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Issuer and the Guarantors agree that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by them of any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agree that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, they shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies
(b) . The Issuer and the Guarantors have not, as of the date hereof, and they shall not, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to any of their respective securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The Issuer and the Guarantors have not entered, and will not enter, into any agreement with respect to any of their respective securities which will grant to any Person piggy-back registration rights with respect to a Registration Statement.
No Inconsistent Agreements
(c) . The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Issuer has obtained the written consent of Holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect, impair, limit or compromise the rights of other Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities may be given by Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities being sold by such Holders pursuant to such Registration Statement; that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence.
