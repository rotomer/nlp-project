Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On August 9, 2012, Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. ("Host L.P."), for whom Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. ("Host REIT") acts as sole general partner, completed an underwritten public offering of $450 million aggregate principal amount of Series C senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 4
 3
/
4
% per year due in 2023.
The offering of the Series C senior notes was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2012, as amended (Registration No. 333-181063), a base prospectus, dated May 16, 2012, included as part of the registration statement, and a prospectus supplement, dated August 2, 2012, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the filing of the prospectus supplement, we are filing as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K an opinion of our counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP, regarding the validity of the securities being registered.
The notes were issued pursuant to a supplement to Host L.P.'s Amended and Restated Indenture, dated August 5, 1998, originally among HMH Properties, Inc. (which merged with and into Host Marriott, L.P., which is now, Host L.P.), the subsidiary guarantors named therein, and HSBC Bank USA f/k/a Marine Midland Bank (now succeeded by The Bank of New York Mellon), as trustee (the "senior notes indenture"). The notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears.
Optional Redemption Provisions and Change of Control Repurchase Right
At any time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Series C senior notes will be redeemable at Host L.P.'s option, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the senior notes indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date.
Host L.P. may also redeem the Series C senior notes within the period beginning 90 days prior to March 1, 2023, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series C senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable date of redemption.
The holders of Series C senior notes will also have the right to require Host L.P. to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering event, as defined in the senior notes indenture, at an offer price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
Ranking and Security
Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, the Series C senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.'s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P., subject to certain limitations set forth in the senior notes indenture. The Series C senior notes and Host L.P.'s existing senior notes effectively will be subordinated to all secured indebtedness that Host L.P. may be permitted to incur under the senior notes indenture, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. In addition, the Series C senior notes will be junior in right of payment to all liabilities of Host L.P.'s subsidiaries. The Series C senior notes will not initially be guaranteed by any of Host L.P.'s direct or indirect subsidiaries and will not initially be secured by pledges of equity interests in any of Host L.P.'s subsidiaries. If Host L.P.'s leverage ratio later exceeds 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that Host L.P. does not have an investment grade long-term unsecured debt rating then Host L.P.'s credit facility triggers the requirement for subsidiary guarantees and pledges of equity interests from certain U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries of Host L.P. In the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered, the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the Host L.P. credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under Host L.P.'s senior notes indenture (including the Series C senior notes) and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility.
Restrictive Covenants
Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, Host L.P.'s ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x by Host L.P. (1.7x in the case of distributions to enable Host REIT to pay dividends on any preferred stock). This ratio is calculated in accordance with Host L.P.'s senior notes indenture and excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.'s consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on Host L.P.'s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.'s ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate values) and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may make distributions and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture. There are exceptions permitting distributions by Host L.P. to Host REIT, and other holders of partnership interests, that are necessary for Host REIT to pay dividends required to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust, even when Host L.P. does not meet the financial covenant tests set forth above.
The senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters, such as limitations on capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, and transactions with affiliates and the incurrence of liens.
Use of Proceeds
As discussed below, Host L.P. intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Series C senior notes to redeem $250 million face amount of 6

The redemption date is September 5, 2012 pursuant to an irrevocable notice delivered by the trustee on Host L.P.'s behalf on August 6, 2012. As previously announced on July 26, 2012, Host L.P. also intends to redeem the remaining $400 million in principal amount of the Series O senior notes on August 27, 2012 with a portion of the proceeds from the $500 million credit facility term loan completed by Host L.P. on July 25, 2012. The Series O senior notes and Series Q senior notes were issued pursuant to a supplement to the senior notes indenture. Under the terms of the Series O senior notes, the redemption price will be 101.063% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Under the terms of the Series Q senior notes, the redemption price will be 102.250% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
In connection with the issuance and sale of the Series C senior notes, Host L.P. entered into an underwriting agreement, dated August 2, 2012, with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the underwriting agreement.

Such Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Company; (ii) the Company has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Person and the Company or any affiliate of the Company and such Indemnified Person shall have been reasonably advised by counsel that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company or such affiliate of the Company or (y) a conflict may exist between such Indemnified Person and the Company or such affiliate of the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Person, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Indemnified Persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Company shall not be liable for
provided
 
any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without the Company's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Person from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of any settlement of any action effected with the written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be brought or asserted against the Company or any of its directors or officers, or any such controlling person based on the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter pursuant to the foregoing sentence, such Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company by Section 8(b) above (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter may, but shall not be required to, employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the Company, its directors, any such officers and each such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to the Indemnified Person by Section 8(b) above.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying
 
parties and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and any of the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (net of discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus.

The indemnity and contribution obligations set forth herein shall be in addition to any liability or obligation such party may otherwise have to any indemnified party.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 8(d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Underwriters (and its related Indemnified Persons) shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriter's obligations to contribute pursuant to Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint.
