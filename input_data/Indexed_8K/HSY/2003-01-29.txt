Excluding the one-time items, net income for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $138,690,000, or $1.02 per share-diluted, compared with $130,523,000, or $.95 per share-diluted, a gain of 7.4 percent. For the full year 2002, consolidated net sales were $4,120,317,000 compared with $4,137,217,000 for 2001. Net income for 2002 was $403,578,000, or $2.93 per share- diluted, compared with $207,156,000, or $1.50 per share diluted, the prior year. Results for 2002 included cumulative pre-tax realignment charges of $34.0 million, or $.16 per share-diluted, and pre-tax expenses of $17.2 million, or $.08 per share-diluted, related to the exploration of the sale of the Company; and in 2001, results included the pre-tax charge of $278.4 million, or $1.25 per share-diluted, related to the realignment initiatives, the gain on the sale of the Luden's business in the third quarter, and the amortization of goodwill. Excluding one-time items, net income for 2002 was $435,994,000, or $3.17 per share- diluted, compared with $391,482,000, or $2.84 per share-diluted, for 2001, an increase of 11.6 percent. A pro forma income statement reflecting these adjustments accompanies this press release. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2002 increased by 0.3 percent on a nominal basis. On a comparable basis, net sales increased by about 1.0 percent spurred by a customer buy-in related to the price increase announced on December 10, 2002. Fourth quarter sales were one to two percent higher than they would have been - more -
absent the buy-in. This increase in sales was offset somewhat by higher trade promotion expense, lower domestic seasonal sales, and weakness in the Canadian market. Gross margin improved by 60 basis points as a result of improved mix and enhanced supply chain efficiencies. Selling, Marketing, and Administrative expenses decreased by 30 basis points as a percentage of sales resulting from significantly lower general and administrative costs, which were only partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses. For the year, sales were off slightly, but the mix of revenues was significantly strengthened as we focused on higher margin products, packtypes, and channels of trade. The improved sales mix, price increases on the packaged candy line, and supply chain efficiencies led to a 130 basis point improvement in gross margin. For the year, Selling, Marketing and Administrative expenses declined 30 basis points as a percentage of sales, due to lower general and administrative costs, which more than offset higher selling and marketing expenses. "Hershey's fourth quarter results were in line with expectations, achieving a balance of improved marketplace performance and profitability," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "Despite a sluggish retail environment, Hershey's consumer takeaway increased, resulting in a 0.4 point gain in market share. Equally as important, supply chain productivity and tight expense control continued to deliver solid gains during the quarter. - more -
"For the full year, we made good progress against our value-enhancing strategy. Profitability, margins, and returns delivered strong growth versus 2001, reflecting improved mix, productivity gains across the supply chain, and lower general and administrative spending. Although net sales were flat in the U.S. business, retail takeaway in all food, drug, mass, and convenience channels, increased by three percent. This performance reflects our disciplined focus on building Hershey's core brands (+8 %), expanding our leadership position in the key chocolate category (+5 %), and significantly improving performance in the high growth convenience store channel (+9 %). "Overall, I'm most pleased with the Company's results in 2002. Our ability to deliver solid performance, despite numerous challenges, positions us well as we continue to implement Hershey's long-term growth initiatives," Lenny concluded.
