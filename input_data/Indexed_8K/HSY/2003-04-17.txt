Exhibit 99 HERSHEY FOODS ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS HERSHEY, Pa., April 17, 2003--Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE: HSY) today announced sales and earnings for the first quarter ended March 30, 2003. Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $953,162,000 compared with $988,506,000 for the first quarter of 2002. Net income was $97,558,000, or $.73 per share-diluted, compared with $87,045,000, or $.63 per share-diluted, in the first quarter of 2002. Excluding a one-time business realignment charge of $9.0 million pre-tax, net income for the first quarter of 2002 was $92,743,000, or $.67 per share-diluted. On this more comparable basis, 2003 earnings per share-diluted increased by 9.0 percent. -more-
This quarter's earnings increase was achieved despite the fact that the Company increased its bad debt reserve by $5.0 million (pre-tax), or two cents per share-diluted, as its best estimate of possible exposure to the Fleming bankruptcy announced on April 1, 2003. Hershey's first quarter sales for 2003 were essentially flat on a comparable basis as a result of the buy-in associated with the price increase announced in December 2002 and continued rationalization of the Company's product line. Gross margin expanded as a result of improved pricing, product and channel mix, supply chain savings, and lower raw ingredient and packaging costs. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were also lower in the quarter, despite the provision for the Fleming bankruptcy. "Our performance during the quarter was in line with expectations, despite a challenging retail environment," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Profitability and margins increased through a combination of better sales mix and on-going productivity gains. Equally as important, Hershey's market leadership position strengthened with solid gains driven by new products, more effective advertising and continued growth within convenience stores. We look forward to building momentum during the balance of 2003 behind our value-enhancing strategy. -more-
In this regard, our sales expectations for the year are 2-3 percent growth on a comparable basis. In addition, we continue to expect earnings growth in the 9-11 percent range for 2003."
