Dugan 717-508-3238 FINANCIAL CONTACT: James A. Edris 717-534-7556 HERSHEY FOODS ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS AND NEW VALUE-ENHANCING INITIATIVES HERSHEY, Pa., July 17, 2003--- Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today announced sales and earnings for the second quarter ended June 29, 2003. Consolidated net sales for the second quarter were $849,115,000 compared with $823,462,000 for the second quarter of 2002. Net income for the second quarter of 2003 was $71,484,000, or $.54 per share-diluted, compared with $63,148,000, or $.46 per share-diluted, for the comparable period in 2002. These GAAP results include pre-tax charges related to business rationalization and realignment initiatives of $4.0 million, or $.02 per share-diluted, in the second quarter of 2003; and $2.5 million, or $.01 per share-diluted, in the second quarter of 2002.
Excluding these charges, net income for the second quarter of 2003 was $73,998,000, or $.56 per share-diluted, compared with $64,752,000, or $.47 per share-diluted, for the second quarter of 2002. SIX-MONTHS RESULTS - ------------------ For the first six months of 2003, consolidated net sales were $1,802,277,000 compared with $1,811,968,000 for the first half of 2002. Net income for the first six months of 2003 was $169,042,000, or $1.27 per share-diluted, compared with $150,193,000, or $1.09 per share-diluted, for the first half of 2002. These GAAP results include pre-tax charges related to business rationalization and realignment initiatives of $4.0 million, or $.02 per share-diluted, in the second quarter of 2003; and $11.5 million, or $.05 per share-diluted, in the first half of 2002. Excluding these charges, net income for the first half of 2003 was $171,556,000, or $1.29 per share-diluted, compared with $157,495,000, or $1.14 per share-diluted, for the first half of 2002. The Corporation uses earnings excluding charges related to business rationalization and realignment initiatives, as shown in the attached pro forma income statements, as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Corporation believes the presentation of earnings excluding such charges provides additional information to
investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items which the Corporation does not believe are indicative of its ongoing operations. The 2002 business realignment initiatives are described in Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 of the Corporation's 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The components of the 2003 brand and product rationalization initiatives and realignment of the sales organization are described below. 2003 RATIONALIZATION AND REALIGNMENT INITIATIVES - ------------------------------------------------ Hershey today announced a number of initiatives continuing its value-enhancing strategy. These include new product introductions, streamlining the supply chain by divesting or eliminating certain non-strategic brands and products, production line rationalization, and realigning the sales organization. During 2003, these actions are expected to result in a net charge of approximately $17 million, or $.08 per share-diluted, of which $.02 per share-diluted have been recognized in the second quarter. The total impact of the initiatives will be cash flow positive in 2003 and slightly accretive in 2004 as a result of expected savings of approximately $5 million annually. SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE - -------------------------- Hershey's second quarter sales increased 3.1 percent, reflecting sales of new products and limited edition items, as well as the impact of the price increase announced in December 2002, partially offset by brand and product rationalization. Gross margin expanded as a
result of pricing, lower raw ingredient and packaging costs, and supply chain savings. Selling, marketing, and administrative costs were essentially flat as a percentage of sales. "Hershey achieved solid performance in the second quarter of 2003," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, "with balanced gains in sales, profitability, and returns. In addition, our marketplace momentum continues to build with market share gains driven by our leading brands, instant consumables, and continued strength in high growth channels. Margins and profitability also increased through a combination of better price realization and on-going productivity savings. "The rationalization and realignment initiatives announced today are the latest steps in our value-enhancing strategy. The sale of non-strategic brands and relocation of certain manufacturing lines will further streamline the supply chain, ensuring proper resource allocation against our growth opportunities. Realigning the sales force provides us with superior category selling capabilities and improved coverage at retail. "On the new product front, we plan to introduce HERSHEY'S S'MORES candy bar, a major new product which will be available in stores late this year. HERSHEY'S S'MORES is a convenient candy bar form of the traditional campfire favorite, incorporating graham crackers, marshmallow, and HERSHEY'S milk chocolate. Consumers overwhelmingly associate homemade s'mores with HERSHEY'S milk chocolate. Later in the year we also will launch SWOOPS chocolate slices in four favorite flavors, packaged in re-sealable on-the-go containers. Also adding excitement to Hershey's fall line-up are Reese's mini pieces in portable tubes, as well as additional Limited Edition REESE'S offerings.
"Together these initiatives build upon the progress we've made to date and will further advance our goal of delivering superior shareholder value over the long term," Lenny concluded.
