Exhibit 99.1
Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today announced record sales and earnings for the third quarter ended September 28, 2003. Consolidated net sales were $1,191,019,000 compared with $1,152,321,000 for the third quarter of 2002. Net income for the third quarter of 2003 was $143,604,000, or $1.09 per share-diluted, compared with $123,065,000, or $.89 per share-diluted, for the comparable period of 2002. This strong performance reflected increased sales, improved margins, and higher returns for the business.
HERSHEY, Pa., October 16, 2003 
Net income for the third quarter of 2003 includes an after-tax charge of $7.4 million, or $.06 per share-diluted, associated with the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for the Company's leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. The GAAP results also include pre-tax charges related to business rationalization and realignment initiatives of $9.7 million, or $.04 per share-diluted, and a gain on the sale of several gum brands of $8.3 million, or $.04 per share-diluted, in the third quarter of 2003.
Results for the third quarter of 2002 included pre-tax charges of $9.1 million, or $.04 per share-diluted, associated with the Company's business realignment initiatives and pre-tax expenses of $17.3 million, or $.08 per share-diluted, related to the exploration of the sale of the Company last year. Excluding these charges and the gain on the sale of the gum brands, income for the third quarter of 2003 was $151,047,000, or $1.15 per share-diluted, compared with $139,809,000, or $1.01 per share-diluted, for the third quarter of 2002, an increase of 13.9 percent.
Nine-Months Results
Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 2003 were $2,993,296,000 compared with $2,964,289,000 for the first nine months of 2002. Net income for the first nine months of 2003 was $312,646,000, or $2.36 per share-diluted, compared with $273,258,000, or $1.98 per share-diluted, for the comparable period of 2002.
Net income for the first nine months of 2003 includes the after-tax charge of $7.4 million, or $.06 per share-diluted, associated with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting. The GAAP results also include pre-tax charges related to business rationalization and realignment initiatives of $13.7 million, or $.06 per share-diluted, and a gain on the sale of certain gum brands of $8.3 million, or $.04 per share-diluted, in the third quarter of 2003.
Results for the first nine months of 2002 included pre-tax charges of $20.7 million, or $.09 per share-diluted, associated with the Company's business realignment initiatives and pre-tax expenses of $17.3 million, or $.08 per share-diluted, related to the exploration of the sale of the Company last year. Excluding these charges and the gain on the sale of the gum brands, income for the first nine months of 2003 was $322,603,000, or $2.43 per share-diluted, compared with $297,304,000, or $2.15 per share-diluted, for the first nine months of 2002, an increase of 13.0 percent.
The Company uses income before accounting changes, excluding charges related to business rationalization and realignment initiatives, the gain or loss on the sale of brands, and incremental, one-time charges such as those incurred to explore the sale of the Company, as shown in the attached pro forma income statements, as key performance measures of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes the presentation of earnings excluding such charges and gains or losses provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items which the Company does not believe are indicative of its ongoing operations.
The 2002 business realignment initiatives are described in Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 of the Company's 2002 Annual report on Form 10-K. The components of the 2003 brand and product rationalization initiatives and realignment of the sales organization are described in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 29, 2003.
Third Quarter Performance
Hershey's third quarter sales increased by 3.4 percent, reflecting sales of instant consumables spurred by the Limited Edition Reese's products, as well as the impact of the price increase announced in December 2002, partially offset by brand and product rationalization. Gross margin expanded as a result of pricing and mix, and supply chain savings, especially lower logistics costs. Selling, Marketing, and Administrative costs increased primarily as a result of higher marketing spending.
"I'm particularly pleased with Hershey's third quarter results," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "This performance underscores the momentum that we're gaining behind our value-enhancing strategy. During the quarter, we delivered solid sales and market share growth as we continue to reshape our product and brand portfolio. Equally as important, on-going productivity gains are providing the appropriate level of investment in both consumer and customer initiatives.
"We intend to maintain this level of brand-building focus while further enhancing our retail selling capabilities. As a result, we expect diluted earnings per share for the full year to be slightly higher than our earlier projections," Lenny concluded.
