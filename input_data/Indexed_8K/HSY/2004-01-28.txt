Fourth Quarter Performance
Hershey's fourth quarter sales increased by two percent, reflecting sales of new products such as S'mores and , and continued growth within the instant consumables business. This increase was partially offset by continued product line rationalization and reduced seasonal sales consistent with our strategic direction. Gross margin expanded as a result of pricing and mix, and supply chain savings, offset somewhat by higher promotional spending. Selling, Marketing, and Administrative costs were down slightly.

"Hershey's fourth quarter results represent a solid finish to a strong year. They are a continuation of the balanced performance that we expect from our value-enhancing strategy," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "Record earnings, margins, and returns during the year reflected a more profitable sales mix, continued supply chain productivity, and solid expense controls across the Company. Sustained gains in retail takeaway and market share were driven by innovative new products and a successful restructuring of our U.S. selling organization, showing that we're on track in meeting both consumer and customer needs.
"Looking ahead, we expect another good year in 2004 as we leverage Hershey's iconic brands and advantaged business systems to build sales, market share, and profitability while managing higher costs for raw materials. Our plans for the year include accelerating our new product efforts, introducing on-trend, higher-margin items that bring excitement to the category. We'll continue to strengthen our ability to compete in the broader snack market through enhanced selling capabilities. Our expectations are to achieve sales and earnings growth in line with previously-stated, long-term goals with on-going improvement in margins and returns," Lenny concluded.
In this sales and earnings release, Hershey has provided income excluding certain items described above, in addition to net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This non-GAAP financial measure, as shown in the attached pro-forma income statements, is used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
