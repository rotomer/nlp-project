Exhibit 99.1
 Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today announced record sales and earnings from operations for the first quarter ended April 4, 2004. Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $1,013,089,000 compared with $953,162,000 for the first quarter of 2003, an increase of 6.3 percent. Net income was $107,147,000, or $.82 per share-diluted, compared with $97,558,000, or $.73 per share-diluted, in the first quarter of 2003, an increase of 12.3 percent in earnings per share.
HERSHEY, Pa., April 22, 2004
The company also announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to stockholders of record May 25, 2004. Hershey stockholders will receive one additional share for each share in their possession on that date. This does not change the proportionate interest a stockholder maintains in the company. The additional shares will be distributed on June 15, 2004.
"I'm very pleased with our results this quarter," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "The combination of higher margin, on-trend new items and continued cost control, yielded strong sales growth, market share expansion, and record profitability. We continue to gain momentum in our areas of strategic focus from both a consumer and customer standpoint.
"As we look ahead, innovative new products and packaging, within core confectionery and the broader snack market, will play a key role in delivering profitable, organic growth. Further, the two-for-one stock split approved by the Board of Directors reflects our belief in Hershey's future growth prospects and our commitment to increasing shareholder value over the long term. For 2004, we continue to target sales growth of three to four percent and diluted earnings per share growth of nine to eleven percent," Lenny concluded.
