Exhibit 99.1
Hershey Foods Corporation (NYSE:HSY) today announced record sales and earnings from operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004. Consolidated net sales were $1,267,963,000 compared with $1,179,255,000 for the fourth quarter of 2003. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $170,286,000, or $.68 per share-diluted, compared with $144,938,000, or $.55 per share diluted, for the comparable period of 2003.
HERSHEY, Pa., January 26, 2005 
For the fourth quarter of 2003, these results, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP), include a pre-tax charge of $11.8 million, or $.03 per share-diluted, relating to business rationalization and realignment initiatives. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $170,286,000, or $.68 per share-diluted, compared with $152,131,000, or $.58 per share-diluted, after excluding the item described above, for the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 17.2 percent.
Record Full-Year Results from Operations
For the full year 2004, consolidated net sales were $4,429,248,000 compared with $4,172,551,000 for 2003, an increase of 6.2 percent. Net income for 2004 was $590,879,000, or $2.30 per share-diluted, compared with $457,584,000, or $1.73 per share-diluted, for 2003.
Net income for 2004 includes the benefit of a $61.1 million, or $.24 per share-diluted, non-cash reduction of income tax expense resulting from the second quarter adjustment to tax reserves following the completion of prior years' tax audits. Net income for 2003 includes an after-tax charge of $7.4 million, or $.03 per share-diluted, associated with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for the Company's leases for certain warehouse and distribution facilities. The results for 2003 also include pre-tax charges related to business rationalization and realignment initiatives of $25.5 million, or $.05 per share-diluted, and a pre-tax gain on the sale of certain gum brands of $8.3 million, or $.02 per share-diluted.
A discussion of the non-cash reduction of income tax expense is contained in Note 15 of the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended October 3, 2004. The components of the 2003 brand and product rationalization initiatives and realignment of the sales organization are described in Management's Discussion and Analysis, and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in the Company's 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Excluding the items mentioned above, net income for 2004 was $529,798,000, or $2.06 per share-diluted, compared with $474,734,000, or $1.79 per share-diluted, for 2003, an increase of 15.1 percent.
Fourth Quarter Performance
Hershey's fourth quarter sales increased by 7.5 percent, primarily attributable to strong unit volume growth for new products and limited editions. Despite higher commodity costs and expenses associated with new product introductions, earnings before interest and taxes grew by 11.7 percent, after excluding the charges for business rationalization and realignment in 2003. Shares outstanding declined as a result of the share purchase from the Milton Hershey School Trust in July, contributing to an increase of 17.2 percent in earnings per share-diluted.
"The fourth quarter was excellent," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong sales growth fueled by new products and more efficient trade spending combined with solid cost control to deliver record profitability. Marketplace momentum accelerated as we gained market share in all major classes of trade. For the year, Hershey delivered record sales, earnings, and returns despite significant cost pressures. This performance further validates the sustainability of our value-enhancing strategy.
"We expect this momentum to continue in 2005 behind additional consumer-driven innovation and superior performance across the value chain, both within core confectionery and the broader snack market. We expect organic net sales to grow near the top of our long-term objective of 3 to 4 percent, before the benefit of the business acquisitions completed in 2004. Earnings per share-diluted should increase within our long-range goal of 9 to 11 percent," Lenny concluded.
In this sales and earnings release, Hershey has provided income measures excluding certain items described above, in addition to income determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures, as shown in the attached pro forma income statements, are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
