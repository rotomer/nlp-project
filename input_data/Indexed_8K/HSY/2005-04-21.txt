Exhibit 99.1
 The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) today announced record sales and earnings for the first quarter ended April 3, 2005. Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $1,126,414,000, compared with $1,013,089,000 for the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 11.2 percent. Net income was $118,221,000, or $.47 per share-diluted, compared with $107,147,000, or $.41 per share-diluted, in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 14.6 percent in earnings per share.
HERSHEY, Pa., April 21, 2005
Hershey's first quarter performance was driven by strong organic sales growth, complemented by the sales contributions from two acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of 2004. Organic growth of eight percent resulted from the strength of new products such as , the Hershey premium cookie line, , and , as well as several Limited Editions of Hershey's leading brands. The acquisitions, Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena, delivered incremental growth of three percent.

The core business achieved margin enhancement in line with the Company's expectations, and as predicted, the acquisitions tempered this margin growth as they continue to be integrated into Hershey's business system. Earnings per share grew by 14.6 percent, driven by 12.3 percent growth in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and the $500 million share purchase from the Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the Milton Hershey School, last July. The positive effect of lower weighted average shares outstanding was offset somewhat by higher interest expense related to the financing of the share purchase and the acquisitions.
"The Company's momentum continued into the first quarter of 2005," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "Strong sales growth combined with solid cost control to deliver record profitability. Consistent with our strategy, new product innovation across both confectionery and snacks more than offset anticipated shortfalls from a shorter seasonal period. In addition, effective trade promotion spending and superior retail execution were instrumental in expanding Hershey's marketplace leadership by one full point.
"Looking to the remainder of 2005, we'll continue to bring news and innovation to the category across multiple consumer benefits. By leveraging Hershey's iconic brands and capitalizing on our value chain capabilities, we'll strengthen our confectionery leadership while gaining critical mass in relevant snack categories. As such, for the full year, we expect organic sales to be above our ongoing 3-4 percent expectations with diluted earnings per share to be at the top of our stated range of 9-11 percent," Lenny concluded.
