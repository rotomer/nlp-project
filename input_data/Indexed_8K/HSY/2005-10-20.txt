Exhibit 99.1
The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) today announced record sales and record earnings from operations for the third quarter ended October 2, 2005. Consolidated net sales for the third quarter were $1,368,240,000 compared with $1,254,508,000 for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 9.1 percent. Net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $119,475,000, or $.48 per share-diluted, compared with $166,229,000, or $.66 per share-diluted, for the comparable period of 2004.
HERSHEY, Pa., October 20, 2005
For the third quarter of 2005, these results include pre-tax charges of $101.4 million, or $.27 per share-diluted, associated with the previously announced business realignment program to advance the Company's value-enhancing strategy. Net income from operations, which excludes these charges, for the third quarter of 2005 was $185,283,000, or $.75 per share-diluted, compared with $166,229,000 or $.66 per share-diluted, an increase of 13.6%.
Record Nine-Months Results from Operations
For the first nine months of 2005, consolidated net sales were $3,483,101,000 compared with $3,161,285,000 for the first nine months of 2004. Net income for the first nine months of 2005 was $335,057,000, or $1.34 per share-diluted, compared with $420,593,000, or $1.62 per share-diluted, for the first nine months of 2004.
Net income for the first nine months of 2005 includes the charges mentioned above. Net income for the first nine months of 2004 includes the benefit of a $61.1 million, or $.23 per share-diluted, non-cash reduction of income tax expense resulting from second quarter adjustments to income tax contingency reserves following the completion of prior years' tax audits. Net income from operations, which excludes these items, for the first nine months of 2005 was $400,865,000, or $1.61 per share-diluted, compared with $359,512,000, or $1.39 per share-diluted, an increase of 15.8%.
Third-Quarter Performance
"Our results for the third quarter continued the momentum from the first half behind new product innovation, strong seasonal sales, and net price realization," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Sales growth, excluding the impact of business acquisitions, of 6.5 percent was broad-based with solid gains in both our core confectionery business and our new snack platforms. Acquisitions contributed 2.6 percent to the total top-line growth. The combination of strong top-line growth and tight expense control, despite higher input costs, resulted in record profitability. Excluding the one-time charges, diluted earnings per share from operations increased 13.6 percent.
"Performance for the first nine months has been excellent with strong gains in net sales, market share, and profitability. We're anticipating a solid fourth quarter given the good start to the important seasonal period and the upcoming introduction of several new products, most notably and filled with peanut butter. In addition, we expect to maintain effective cost controls across the business system, thereby yielding a gain in operating margins.

"Therefore, for 2005 we expect net sales to increase at a rate above our long-term goal of 3-4 percent and diluted earnings per share from operations should increase at a rate greater than our long-term range of 9-11 percent.
"As we look to 2006, our goal is to build upon the marketplace momentum established over the past several quarters. The strategy of benefit-driven innovation continues to resonate with consumers. Our plans reflect a step-up in new product innovation while capitalizing on key growth opportunities with the more profitable classes of trade.
"Against this backdrop of strong performance are broadly higher input costs. We're now developing plans to address these cost pressures. These plans will include both productivity initiatives as well as the benefit of our previously announced business realignment program. We're confident in our ability to achieve organic sales growth in 2006 somewhat above our 3-4 percent long-term goal with an increase in diluted earnings per share, excluding business realignment charges, slightly above 9-11 percent."
Based on current estimates, the cost to implement the business realignment program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $140 million to $150 million, or $.41 to $.44 per share-diluted on an after-tax basis. Approximately 90 percent of the charge will be recorded in the second half of 2005, with the remainder recorded in the first half of 2006.
In this sales and earnings release, Hershey has provided income measures excluding certain items described above, in addition to net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures, as shown in the attached income statements, are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
