Item 1.01   Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
        On December 12, 2005, The Hershey Company (the "Company") announced that it had entered into an agreement ("Agreement") with Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (the "Milton Hershey School Trust"), dated December 12, 2005, under which the Milton Hershey School Trust intends to participate on a proportional basis in plans approved by the Company's Board of Directors ("Board") to repurchase the Company's outstanding Common Stock, par value one dollar per share ("Common Stock"). The Board had approved the repurchase of $250 million of its Common Stock in April 2005, and on December 6, 2005 approved the repurchase of an additional $500 million of its Common Stock. The Company expects to complete both authorizations by the end of 2006. The initial term of the Agreement will commence on December 13, 2005, and will expire on January 30, 2006 (the "Term"). The parties, by mutual consent, may renew the Agreement for subsequent additional terms.
        Under the terms of the Agreement, the Milton Hershey School Trust will sell to the Company on a weekly basis during the Term the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock the Company has purchased on the open market from persons other than the Milton Hershey School Trust during the preceding calendar week (the "Prior Week Shares") multiplied by .44. The purchase price for each weekly purchase will be the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") paid by the Company for the Prior Week Shares. The VWAP is calculated by dividing the total consideration paid by the Company, without taking commissions into account, for the Prior Week Shares by the Prior Week Shares, excluding any transaction involving the purchase of shares of Common Stock directly from affiliates of the Company. The Milton Hershey School Trust is not required to sell shares to the Company if the VWAP for the shares for such week is less than $55 per share.
        A copy of the Agreement is attached hereto and filed as Exhibit 10.1. The description of the Agreement contained herein is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement which is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 7.01   Regulation FD
        The Company issued a press release on December 12, 2005 reaffirming its 2005 and 2006 earnings expectations and announcing the $500 million stock repurchase and entry into the Agreement with the Milton Hershey School Trust. A copy of that press release is attached hereto and furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
 In a series of presentations to be given to investment analysts in Hershey on Tuesday, December 13, The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) will reaffirm its expectations for the full-year 2005, stating that net sales will increase at a rate above the long-term goal of 3-4 percent, and diluted earnings per share from operations should increase at a rate greater than the long-term range of 9-11 percent.
HERSHEY, Pa., December 12, 2005
In addition, the Company will highlight major growth initiatives including benefit-driven innovation, continued expansion within the U.S. snack market, and a disciplined approach to achieving profitable growth in key global markets. To support these growth initiatives, Hershey will provide a comprehensive review of productivity and cost savings efforts which will be implemented in 2006 and beyond. In this context the Company will reaffirm its expectations for 2006, calling for sales growth somewhat above its 3-4 percent long-term goal, with increased diluted earnings per share slightly above 9-11 percent, excluding the previously announced business realignment charges.
Stock Repurchase Program
The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has approved an additional $500 million stock repurchase authorization. The Company continues to execute the $250 million buyback authorized in April 2005 and expects to complete both authorizations by the end of 2006.
In this connection, The Hershey Company and Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Milton Hershey School Trust (School Trust), have entered into an agreement under which the School Trust intends to participate on a proportional basis in the Company's stock purchases. The terms of the agreement are described in a Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC this afternoon.
"We're very pleased with the continued momentum across our business," said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "We remain on track for another record year in 2005 in terms of sales growth, market share gains, and earnings from operations. Equally as important, our plans for 2006 have been finalized and will enable Hershey to continue to deliver top-tier performance. Regarding the stock repurchase authorization, the Hershey Board of Directors is confident in the future growth prospects of the Company. This authorization underscores our commitment to rewarding shareholders over the long term."

Based on current estimates, the cost to implement the current business realignment program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $140 million to $150 million, or $.41 to $.44 per share-diluted on an after-tax basis. Approximately 90 percent of the charge will be recorded in the second half of 2005, with the remainder recorded in the first half of 2006.
