Exhibit 99.1
 
 
HERSHEY, Pa., December 21, 2005
---The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) announced today that it intends to begin expensing employee stock options and other share-based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004),
Share-Based Payment
(SFAS No. 123R), under the modified retrospective method effective in the fourth quarter of 2005. Under the modified retrospective method, the full-year results for 2005 will be reported as though stock options granted by the Company had been expensed beginning January 1, 2005.
Under the modified retrospective method, the financial statements for years prior to 2005 will be adjusted to reflect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The Company currently estimates that the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123R in 2005 will be approximately $0.09 per share-diluted, of which approximately $0.03 per share-diluted will be recorded in the fourth quarter. The Company will also record a deferred tax asset related to the 2005 income tax benefit and will adjust the consolidated balance sheets for years prior to 2005, in each case to reflect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The Company anticipates that the amount of expense for share-based compensation in 2006 will be comparable to the expense for 2005.
Table 1 below provides the additional estimated expense for stock options and other share-based compensation under SFAS No. 123R for the cost of sales and selling, marketing and administrative classifications on the consolidated statements of income for the first nine months of 2005. Table 2 provides the additional estimated expense under SFAS No. 123R for those classifications on the consolidated statements of income for 2004 by quarter and for the full year.
Table 1 -Estimated 2005 Stock Option Compensation Expense for the first nine months of 2005 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
Table 2 - Estimated Stock Option Compensation Expense for 2004 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
Approximately half of the increase in the impact on earnings per share-diluted for the full year 2005 versus 2004 reflects the accelerated expensing of stock options for grants to retirement eligible employees required under SFAS No. 123R. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the impact of a change in the Companys incentive compensation philosophy by granting stock options to more employees resulting in higher expense in 2005 relative to grants included in the expense for 2004. The earnings per share impact for 2005 also includes a full year of expense for the worldwide stock option grant to over 13,000 employees in July 2004 under the Companys Broad Based Stock Option Plan.
