HERSHEY, Pa., July 20, 2006
 The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) today announced sales and earnings for the second quarter ended July 2, 2006. Consolidated net sales were $1,052,067,000, up 6.4 percent compared with $988,447,000 for the second quarter of 2005. Net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $98,440,000, or $0.41 per share-diluted, compared with $93,223,000 or $0.37 per share-diluted, for the comparable period of 2005.
 
The results reflect the expensing of employee stock options and other share-based compensation for all periods presented in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004),
Share-Based
 
Payment
, under the modified retrospective application method. Under the
 
 
modified retrospective application method, the results for 2005 were adjusted and are reported as though stock options granted by the Company had been expensed beginning January 1, 2005.
 
For the second quarter of 2006, these results, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), include a net pre-tax charge of $2.6 million associated with the previously announced business realignment initiatives to advance the Companys value-enhancing strategy. Net income from operations, which excludes the net charge for the second quarter of 2006, was $100,250,000, or $0.42 per share-diluted, compared with $93,223,000 or $0.37 per share-diluted in 2005, an increase of 13.5 percent.
 
 
Record Second-Quarter Performance
 
Hersheys second quarter results were encouraging, said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, as strong sales growth of 6.4 percent combined with overall solid cost controls delivered a 13.5 percent increase in diluted earnings per share from operations. Hersheys new product innovation, particularly in the areas of dark chocolate, refreshment, and
Kissables
, was the major contributor to this sales performance. Seasonal shipments also positively impacted sales during the quarter.
 
 
First Half Results
 
For the first six months of 2006, consolidated net sales were $2,184,795,000, compared with $2,114,861,000 for the first half of 2005. Net income for the first six months of 2006 was $219,408,000, or $.91 per share-diluted, compared with $206,245,000, or 
$0.83 per share-diluted, for the first half of 2005. Excluding a first half pre-tax net charge of $4.4 million related to the Companys business realignment initiatives, net income for the first six months of 2006 was $222,433,000, or $0.92 per share-diluted.
 
Our first half results showed an improvement in net sales trends, a strengthening of Hersheys marketplace leadership behind our new product platforms and excellent retail execution, and strong profitability Lenny continued.
 
As we enter the second half of 2006, were encouraged by our prospects. A combination of new product innovation, solid seasonal programming, and good visibility into our total cost structure will enable us to deliver our full-year objectives. Therefore,
 
 
 we anticipate net sales growth for 2006 to be somewhat above our long-term range of 
3-4 percent, and the increase in diluted earnings per share from operations should slightly exceed our long-term expectations of 9-11 percent, Lenny concluded.
 
 
Note:
 
In this sales and earnings release, Hershey has provided income measures excluding certain items described above, in addition to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures, as shown in the attached pro forma income statements, are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
 
During the second half of 2005, the Company recorded pre-tax charges associated with business realignment initiatives of $119.0 million or $0.29 per share-diluted. Net pre-tax charges for business realignment initiatives of $4.4 million or $0.01 per share-diluted were recorded during the first half of 2006. Based on our current estimates, the total cost to implement the business realignment initiatives is expected to be approximately
$125 million to $135 million before tax or $0.30 to $0.32 per share-diluted. The business realignment program is expected to be fully completed by the end of 2006.
