On July 28, 2006, The Hershey Company (the Company) announced that it has entered into an agreement (Agreement) with Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (the Milton Hershey School Trust), dated July 26, 2006, under which the Milton Hershey School Trust intends to continue to participate on a proportional basis in plans approved by the Companys Board of Directors (Board) to repurchase the Companys outstanding Common Stock, par value one dollar per share (Common Stock). The Board had approved the repurchase of $250 million of its Common Stock in April 2005, and in December 2005 approved the repurchase of an additional $500 million of its Common Stock. The Company completed the April 2005 repurchase authorization in February, 2006, and expects to complete the December 2005 authorization by the end of 2006. The term of the Agreement will commence on July 31, 2006 and expire on February 2, 2007 (the Term). The parties, by mutual consent, may renew the Agreement for subsequent additional terms. This Agreement is a renewal of an existing agreement that commenced on January 30, 2006 and will expire on July 31, 2006.
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Milton Hershey School Trust will sell to the Company on a weekly basis during the Term the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock the Company has purchased on the open market from persons other than the Milton Hershey School Trust during the preceding calendar week (the Prior Week Shares) multiplied by .46. The purchase price for each weekly purchase will be the volume weighted average price (VWAP) paid by the Company for the Prior Week Shares. The VWAP is calculated by dividing the total consideration paid by the Company, without taking commissions into account, for the Prior Week Shares by the Prior Week Shares, excluding any transaction involving the purchase of shares of Common Stock directly from affiliates of the Company. The Milton Hershey School Trust is not required to sell shares to the Company if the VWAP for the shares for such week is less than $55 per share.
 
A copy of the Agreement is attached hereto and filed as Exhibit 10.1. The description of the Agreement contained herein is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement which is incorporated by reference herein.

As of June 30, 2006, the Milton Hershey School Trust owned 7.4% of the Companys Common Stock and 99.7% of the Companys Class B Common Stock outstanding.
