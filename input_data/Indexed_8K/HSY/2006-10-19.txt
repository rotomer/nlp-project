The results reflect the expensing of employee stock options and other share-based compensation for all periods presented in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004),  , under the modified retrospective application method. Under the modified retrospective application method, the results for 2005 were adjusted and are reported as though stock options granted by the Company had been expensed beginning January 1, 2005.
Share-Based
Payment
 
For the third quarter of 2006 and 2005, these results, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), include net pre-tax charges of $1.7 million and $101.4 million, or $0.01 and $0.26 per share, respectively, associated with the previously announced business realignment initiatives to advance the Companys value-enhancing strategy. Net income from operations, which excludes the net charges for the third quarter of 2006 and 2005, was $184,778,000, or $0.78 per share-diluted in 2006, compared with $179,960,000, or $0.72 per share-diluted in 2005, an increase of 8.3 percent in earnings per share-diluted.
 
 
Third-Quarter Performance
Hersheys results for the third quarter were below expectations, said Richard H. Lenny, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Following a period of sustained in-market success, we experienced a slowdown in consumer takeaway and thus, a loss of market share. While we had solid growth within both our sugar confectionery and refreshment businesses, within chocolate, the shift from line extensions with lower incrementality to more sustainable value-added platforms has taken longer than anticipated. Although Hersheys share declined in total for the quarter, seasonal performance continues to be strong with Halloween off to a good start.
 
 
Sales for the quarter increased 3.3 percent through a combination of growth within dark chocolate and solid seasonal shipments. Overall strong expense control and the impact of the share buyback resulted in an 8.3 percent increase in diluted earnings per share from operations. The objective for the balance of 2006 is to regain Hersheys marketplace momentum by focusing on new platforms and advantaged customers. Therefore, weve significantly increased our consumer and customer support. This investment will strengthen Hersheys leadership position within chocolate by leveraging our core brands and delivering strong introductory programming for the new platforms, most notably  Lenny stated.
Cacao Reserve,
 
 
Its within this strategic objective of strengthening Hersheys chocolate leadership, that today, were also announcing the acquisition of the assets of Dagoba Organic Chocolate, LLC. This business complements our premium chocolate growth platform and clearly positions Hershey as a key player within the high growth, on trend organic market. As with the Scharffen Berger and Joseph Schmidt acquisitions, Dagoba will extend our reach to those consumers and customers who are seeking a superior chocolate experience.
 
 
Nine-Months Results and Outlook
For the first nine months of 2006, consolidated net sales were $3,598,156,000, compared with $3,483,101,000 for the first nine months of 2005. Reported net income for the first nine months of 2006 was $403,073,000, or $1.68 per share-diluted, compared with $320,397,000, or $1.29 per share-diluted, for the first nine months of 2005. For the first nine months of 2006 and 2005, these results, prepared in accordance with GAAP, include net pre-tax charges of $6.0 million and $101.4 million, or $0.01 and $0.26 per share, respectively, associated with the previously announced business realignment initiatives to advance the Companys value-enhancing strategy. Net income from operations, which excludes the net charges for the first nine months of 2006 and 2005, was $407,211,000, or $1.69 per share-diluted, compared with $386,205,000, or $1.55 per share-diluted in 2005, an increase of 9.0 percent in earnings per share-diluted.
 
 
Based on the results through the third quarter and our marketplace initiatives for the balance of the year, we now anticipate net sales growth for 2006 to be within our long-term 3-4 percent range and the increase in diluted earnings per share from operations to be slightly below our on-going 9-11 percent expectations.
 
 
As we look to 2007, were committed to delivering a superior value proposition to our consumers and customers. Our strategic focus will be to accelerate growth behind Hersheys core brands, successfully build new platforms, primarily in dark chocolate and refreshment, and better leverage Hersheys scale at retail. While we anticipate somewhat higher input costs in 2007, were working on plans to address these cost pressures. Therefore, through this combination of improved marketplace performance and overall cost control, we expect to achieve net sales growth in 2007 within our 3-4 percent long-term goal, with an increase in diluted earnings per share from operations within our on-going 9-11 percent expectations, Lenny concluded.
 
 
In this sales and earnings release, Hershey has provided income measures excluding certain items described above, in addition to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures, as shown in the attached pro forma income statements, are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
Note:
 
 
 
During the second half of 2005, the Company recorded pre-tax charges associated with business realignment initiatives of $119.0 million or $0.29 per share-diluted. Net pre-tax charges for business realignment initiatives of $6.0 million, or $0.01 per share-diluted, were recorded during the first nine-months of 2006. Based on our current estimates, the total cost to implement the business realignment initiatives is expected to be under $130 million before tax or $0.30 to $0.32 per share-diluted. The business realignment program is expected to be fully completed by the end of 2006.
