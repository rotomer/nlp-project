ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
On December 27, 2006, the Board of Directors of The Hershey Company (the "Company") approved amendments to the Company's Executive Benefits Protection Plan (Group 3A), effective December 29, 2006. The amendments were contained in an amended and restated plan, called The Hershey Company Executive Benefits Protection Plan (Group 3A) Amended and Restated as of December 29, 2006 (the "Plan"). The Plan, which is intended to provide certain benefits upon a Change in Control and severance benefits upon a termination of employment to specified Executives, was amended to:
 
 
 
 
These changes impact the benefits of all of the Companys executive officers, including Richard H. Lenny, the Companys Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lenny has consented to these changes pursuant to a provision in his Executive Employment Agreement (Agreement) that would have provided him the right, absent his consent, to terminate the Agreement for Good Reason (as that term is defined in the Agreement).
Compensation and benefit plans for all employees, including executives, are continually reviewed for legal compliance and benchmarked with peer companies. In connection with a review of the Plan for compliance with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 409A, the Company's Board of Directors made other changes to bring executive severance in the event of a Change in Control of the Company more in line with benchmarks and with stockholder expectations.

An Executive shall be deemed to have terminated his or her employment for Good Reason during the Coverage Period if he or she terminates his or her employment with Good Reason prior to a Change in Control or Potential Change in Control if the circumstance or event

In the event that the termination of employment of an Executive as described in this Section 8.1 occurs following a Potential Change in Control or within six (6) months prior to a Change in Control, there shall be a presumption that clauses (a) and (b) of the first two sentences of this Section 8.1 shall have been met.

21
shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Plan to the executors, personal representatives or administrators of his or her estate.
8.6
 
Incompetency
. Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of an Executive, if legally incompetent or incapable of giving a receipt therefor, shall be deemed paid when paid to his or her guardian or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to provide for his or her care, and such payment shall fully discharge the Company, the Plan Administrator and all other parties with respect thereto.
8.7
 
Reduction of Benefits By Legally Required Benefits
.

8.8
 
Enforceability

No Mitigation
.

Further, the amount of any payment or benefit provided for under this Plan (other than to the extent provided in Subsection 3.2.2) shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by him or her as a result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by him or her to the Company, or otherwise.
8.11
 
Successors

9.1
 
Subject to the terms and conditions noted below, in the event Executives employment with the Company is, or is deemed to be, terminated by the Company without cause (as defined below), or is, or is deemed to be, terminated by the Executive for good reason (as defined below) regardless of whether a Potential Change in Control or Change in Control has occurred or is pending (such termination hereinafter is referred to as Change in Status Event); provided, however, any termination of an Executives employment which results in such Executive being entitled to Severance Benefits pursuant to Section 3.2 shall not constitute a Change in Status Event and no Executive entitled to Severance Benefits pursuant to Section 3.2 shall in addition be entitled to the benefits provided for in this Section 9.1:
From and after the date of the Change in Status Event for a period of two years thereafter, the Company will continue Executive as an employee on a paid leave of absence with the benefit coverage of an active employee, excluding disability coverage and, in the case of an Executive that terminates on or after January 1, 2007, excluding coverage under all tax-qualified retirement plans. Executives base compensation during the paid leave of absence will equal his or her Annual Base Salary as defined in Section 1.2 (substituting Change in Status Event for Change in Control) of Article 1 of this Group 3A Plan. Executive shall also remain a participant in the AIP during the paid leave of absence period and Executives target percentage for AIP payment purposes will be that in effect just prior to the Change in Status Event, and Executive will be scored on the basis of the actual achievement of the Companys performance targets for AIP, but up to a maximum of 100%. Executive will additionally be entitled to payments for AIP and PSU grants for any previously deferred awards or any awards covering periods ending prior to the date of the Change in Status Event that have been earned but not yet paid prior to the date of the Change in Status Event.
9.1.1
 
During the above leave of absence: (a) Executives stock options granted prior to the Change in Status Event will continue to vest in accordance with the vesting schedule(s) applicable under the terms of the grant(s), but (b) Executive will not be eligible to participate in or receive new grants or benefits under the LTIP and will not be eligible for participation in or the payment of benefits under the Executive Benefits Protection Plan (except for under this Article 9), the Employee Benefits Protection Plan, or the Severance Benefits Plan. If Executive meets the eligibility requirements of paragraph 3 of the SERP and elects to retire from employment with the Company during the leave of absence, Executives paid leave of absence will cease and the Executive will be treated for all purposes as a retiree in accordance with the terms of the SERP and the Companys other benefit plans.
9.2
 
Executives voluntary resignation from the Company other than for good reason (as defined below) shall not constitute a Change in Status Event, and therefore will not entitle Executive to the benefits provided for in Section 9.1 above. In such event, Executive would be entitled to the benefits provided under the benefit plans of the Company to which Executive is entitled in accordance with the terms of those plans.
24
9.3
 
Termination of Executives employment without cause for purposes of this Article 9 shall mean termination of active employment by the Company not based on cause as defined in paragraph 2(a) of the SERP. Termination of Executives employment for good reason for purposes of this Article 9 shall mean termination of active employment by the Executive during the first two years of the tenure of the Companys then current Chief Executive Officer if, and only if, the Executive has not given the Company written notice of his or her intention to retire and during such two year period and prior to the Executives termination of active employment either (i) the Company has assigned duties to the Executive or taken other actions which are inconsistent with his or her position (including status, offices, titles and reporting relationships), authority, duties or responsibilities immediately prior to the then current Chief Executive Officer becoming the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and such assignment of duties or other action results in more than an insignificant diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive; or (ii) the Company has reduced the Executives annual base salary as in effect, as applicable, on the date the then current Chief Executive Officer became the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or as the same may be increased from time to time.
9.4
 
The severance arrangements of this Article 9 shall not be considered to constitute an employment contract. The terms and conditions of the Long-Term Incentive Program Participation Agreement and Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims by and between Executive and the Company (Participation and Arbitration Agreement), are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof as if fully set forth herein. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Participation and Arbitration Agreement, the terms and conditions thereof shall remain in effect for three years after Executives Change in Status Event regardless of whether Executive is eligible or not to receive benefits under the SERP.
10.1
 
To the extent Code section 409A applies to any compensation or other benefit payable under this Plan, this Article 10 applies, and to the extent that it conflicts with any other provision of this Plan, it supersedes such conflicting provisions. If Code section 409A does not apply to any compensation or other benefits payable under this Plan, this Article 10 shall have no effect.
 
10.1.1
 
In General
. This Article 10 is intended to comply with the provisions of Code section 409A and the Treasury regulations relating thereto. In furtherance of this intent, to the extent this Plan is subject to Code section 409A, it shall be interpreted, operated, and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions.
25
                                                10.1.2.1
 
Key Employee shall mean an employee who is treated as a "specified employee" under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, i.e., a key employee (as defined in Section 416(i) of the Code, without regard to paragraph (5) thereof, and determined as of each December 31 in accordance with Section 409A of the Code) of the Company.
10.1.2.2
 
Separation from Service or Separate from Service shall mean a "separation from service" within the meaning of Code section 409A.
10.1.3
 
Timing of Benefit Payments
. If the Executive is a Key Employee, all amounts payable under Article 3 and Article 9 as a result of the Executive's Separation from Service that are subject to Code section 409A shall not be paid prior to the date that is six months following the Executive's Separation from Service (or on the date of the Executive's death, if earlier). With respect to PSUs payable to a Key Employee under Section 3.2.3, such PSUs will be credited with any dividends that would otherwise be payable on the PSUs during the six-month period.
10.1.4
 
Continuation of Group Term Life Insurance
. If the Company continues to provide life insurance coverage under Section 3.2.2 to an Executive who is a Key Employee, to the extent payment of such coverage by the Company would violate Code section 409A, the Executive shall be solely responsible for paying for the coverage during the six month period following the Executive's Separation from Service (or until the date of the Executive's death, if earlier).
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused the Plan to be amended and restated as of December 29, 2006.
