The Supply Agreements provide that Callebaut will, through the use of its own technical information and equipment, and through the use of certain technical information provided by Hershey, manufacture, package and deliver the Products defined therein to Hershey in exchange for the consideration referenced in the respective Supply Agreement. The following terms and conditions shall apply to each of the Supply Agreements:
 
 
A.         
Production of Products
 
1.         Callebaut will produce, package and deliver Products for Hershey in accordance with the Hershey Specifications.  The Hershey Specifications are attached hereto as Exhibit A.  Callebaut agrees to abide by Hersheys Supplier Code of Conduct. Callebaut acknowledges that the Hershey Specifications may be revised upon prior written notice by Hershey, in its sole discretion, at any time during the term of this Agreement.  In the event that revisions to the Hershey Specifications result in a change in cost to Callebaut, including a change in cost due to any required capital addition or expenditure on the part of Callebaut, following good-faith negotiations between the Parties, the amount paid to Callebaut under the applicable Supply Agreement will be adjusted to reflect the new cost.  If such revisions render unmarketable any of the Products or inventories of ingredients or packaging materials, Hershey shall purchase, up to the quantity authorized in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(B)(2), all such items from Callebaut at Callebaut's cost or other agreed upon price.
 
 
2.         Callebaut agrees to pay for any and all capital required to manufacture the Products unless specified otherwise in this Agreement or in a Supply Agreement.
 
 
B.         
Operations Planning
 
The Parties agree to plan the production under each Supply Agreement in accordance with the following principles:
 
1.         On October 1 of each year during the term of each Supply Agreement, Hershey will provide to Callebaut an estimate of the twelve (12) month demand for the upcoming calendar year (January to December) by Product (the Annual Estimate).
 
2.         Thirty (30) days before each calendar quarter during the term of each Supply Agreement Hershey will provide Callebaut with a scheduling agreement which will be used to track product shipments and subsequent invoices (the Scheduling Agreement).  This Scheduling Agreement will provide a more current estimate of Product demand for the upcoming quarter at the Product level and will identify Product cost in accordance with the terms of the applicable Supply Agreement.  It is understood by the Parties that when production is terminated, and possibly during the term of this Agreement, some materials will either become obsolete due to changes in the Hershey's Specifications or there will be extra material due to incorrect forecasting.  While Hershey will be financially responsible for these obsolete and/or extra materials:
 
 
 
 
3.         Each week during the term of this Agreement Hershey will provide Callebaut a shipment plan by facility for the Products showing estimated required shipments of Products on a twelve (12) week rolling basis (the Shipment Plan).  Additionally, for Monterrey and Robinson Hershey  will further identify the first two weeks of the Shipment Plan into daily shipments, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and non-business days if Hershey requires shipments on such days.
 
4.         Except as set forth in the volume and pricing provisions of Section 2(B)(7)  and any obligation that exists under Section 2(B)(2) above  with respect to the Supply Agreement for Mexico and the Supply Agreement for Robinson Hershey shall be obligated to purchase from Callebaut only the three day production reflected in the relevant Shipment Plan for the day after such Shipment Plan was received and the next two days, and with respect to the Global Supply Agreement Hershey shall be obligated to purchase from Callebaut only the first two-weeks production reflected in the then-current Shipment Plan.
5.         Designated representatives within the plants will plan the shipments outlined in an applicable Shipment Plan on a daily and/or shift basis.
 
6.         Callebaut will supply all of Hersheys actual demands. In the event Hersheys daily production demand exceeds Callebauts daily capacity, Callebaut will make the Product that exceeded its capacity on the next available production run. Callebaut will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that commitments to third party customers do not limit or interfere with any production for Hershey, provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement or any Supply Agreement shall be interpreted as requiring Callebaut to cancel service commitments to third-party customers as a result of any error or omission in a Scheduling Agreement or Shipment Plan.  For planning purposes in the Monterrey facility, Callebaut will provide Hershey with information pertaining to the facilitys estimated daily production capacity no later than May 1, 2008.
 
7.         In the event that Hersheys actual order volume of Products in any given calendar year under the applicable Supply Agreement is less than the amounts set forth on Exhibit F from Callebauts Monterrey facility and Callebauts Robinson facility, respectively, and provided the shortfall is not due to Callebauts action or inaction,  the consequences shall be limited to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
66% x [the sum of the amount by which the Annual Estimates exceed the Base Tiers, plus the Estimated Subsequent Supply Agreement Volume]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If during the term of a Supply Agreement, through no fault of Hershey, Callebaut is delayed or unable to deliver Products in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any Supply Agreement, other than as a result of a force majeure event, then in addition to any other remedies available to Hershey, Callebaut will, at Hersheys option, either reimburse Hershey for incremental costs it incurs in obtaining alternate supplies of Products or Callebaut will supply Products from its facilities at the same delivered cost as specified in the current applicable Scheduling Agreement.  Products can only be sourced in a form and/or from a country which allows Hersheys country of origin labeling to remain correct, and which does not subject the finished goods Hershey makes with the Products to additional duties or taxes upon export, unless Callebaut reimburses Hershey for any such additional duties or taxes.
 
 
D.         
Product Costing and Procurement
 
1.         Hershey shall reimburse Callebaut for the ingredients and packaging materials used to produce Products, at costs to be established in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(D)(2), shall pay Callebaut a conversion cost specified in the Pricing Grid of the applicable Supply Agreement (which conversion cost shall include Callebaut's cost of labor, overhead and profit and, where applicable, the incremental absorption charge), and shall pay Callebauts agreed upon working capital financing costs.  Product costs will be developed and communicated with full detail to include at minimum ingredient component costs and yields, packaging component costs and yields and conversion costs.  Product costs will be established no later than December 31 for the following full calendar year (January to December), subject to the provisions of Section 2(D)(4).
 
2.         Hershey and Callebaut agree to establish Product costs as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.         During November of each year hereunder Callebaut will have entered all agreed upon input costs and variables into the product pricing model and will provide Hershey with costs for each Product by appropriate unit of measure (case, pound, other).
 
4.         Product costs will be calculated in accordance with this Agreement for a period of one year (January  December).  These costs will be used in the Scheduling Agreements and will be subject to change only at the start of each calendar year, except in the case of an event of Force Majeure or for exceptional inflationary events in areas such as energy costs or currency rates.  The Parties agree to jointly work towards minimizing the impact of any such fluctuations.
 
5.         Should Product(s) be added throughout the year, Hershey and Callebaut will create Product costs by unit of measure following the above methodology (to include all
 
            ingredients, packaging, conversion costs and yields/waste/overweight) 30 days before the first production.
 
6.         In the event that a change in Hershey Specifications results in an increase or decrease in actual conversion costs, Hershey and Callebaut will review documented changes and negotiate a new conversion cost that reflects such change which will take effect from the date of the change.
 
7.         All Callebaut orders under Hershey supply contracts will be reported to Hershey in a manner established by Hershey and Callebaut.
 
8.         Product costs will include a financing fee on the Callebaut Raw Materials, the conversion fee charged by Callebaut and the incremental absorption charge where applicable.  For purposes of the financing fee, cocoa based products involving forward contracts shall be considered Callebaut Raw Materials.  The agreed to financing fee for the subsequent calendar year will be fixed at each November Steering Committee Meeting and will reflect Callebauts estimated cost of  borrowing.
 
9.         Hershey and Callebaut will each designate one contact for all pricing questions and other operating issues arising under this agreement or any Supply Agreement.
 
 
E.         
Product Yields
 
1.         Each Supply Agreement will set forth a waste, loss, and/or overweight allowance for each ingredient and packaging component used to produce a Product (the Established Yields). Callebaut shall be responsible for all additional ingredients and packaging components required as a result of Callebauts failure to comply with Established Yields.
 
2.         Hershey and Callebaut will review any issues with Established Yields where applicable.  Should Hershey and Callebaut agree to adjust the Established Yield, the new Established Yield will apply for the following years production (January-December).  Any adjustment will not be retroactive, except as otherwise mutually agreed to by the Parties.
 
 
F.         
Currency
 
1.         Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, Hershey will pay for Products produced under the Monterrey and Robinson Supply Agreements in United States Dollars.  Any reference to Dollars or $ in this Agreement or any Related Agreement shall be a reference to United States Dollars.
 
2.         For all other production Hershey and Callebaut will agree to the payment currency and exchange rates at minimum thirty (30) days before such production under the Global Supply Agreement or a Subsequent Agreement begins.
 
3.         Any and all currency and exchange rate agreements will be reviewed annually by the Parties.
 
4.         Callebaut and Hershey will agree on currency exchange rates for use in calendar year pricing for those Callebaut Raw Materials that involve currencies other than the currency used to invoice Hershey for Products.  Callebaut shall be responsible for any variances in such currency exchange rates as part of the calendar year pricing, except for cases of
 
 
exceptional inflationary events that may affect calendar year pricing.  The Parties agree to jointly work towards minimizing the impact of any such exceptional inflationary events.
 
 
G.         
Payments for Products
 
1.         Callebaut shall issue its invoice for Products produced in accordance with this Agreement at the time such Products are shipped or delivered to Hershey in accordance with the delivery terms.  Hershey shall pay any amount due under this Agreement following receipt of Callebaut's invoice on terms of net twenty-three (23) days from date of receipt of invoice plus a seven day grace period to enable weekly grouping of payments, except in the case of a good faith dispute.
 
2.         To ensure prompt payment of all invoices, Callebaut shall include on each invoice the information requested by Hershey in a form agreed in advance.
 
3.         Invoices shall be electronically submitted. The date of receipt of electronic invoices will be the date following the date upon which it is transmitted.
 
4.         All payments shall be electronically transferred to the designated bank account of the Party to which such payments are due.
 
5.         A Party may only set off amounts it is owed by the other Party if permitted by applicable law and against amounts it owes the other Party in the event the Party seeking to offset payments has a credible concern about the other Partys creditworthiness.
 
 
H.         
Productivity
 
1.         Hershey and Callebaut recognize the need to provide the highest quality product at the lowest possible cost.  To accomplish this objective, Hershey and Callebaut agree to cooperate in a continuing effort to improve the productivity of all operations.
 
2.         These productivity efforts should target but are not limited to, (i) improved yields for packaging and ingredient utilization; (ii) optimization of output in all phases of the production process; (iii) obtaining the lowest possible cost per unit on packaging and ingredients; (iv) labor reductions through effective utilization; (v) reduction of overweights; and (vi) minimization of sampling/testing of the Products.
 
3.         It is recognized that Callebauts ability to share conversion cost productivity for its Robinson and Monterrey facilities will be dependent on Callebauts ability to fill available capacity with third party volume. Hershey and Callebaut agree to share in all productivity improvements related to production output, labor reductions, etc.  Notwithstanding the above, Hershey shall receive 100% of all cost improvements resulting from reductions in unit costs for ingredients and packaging, minimization of all sampling/testing, as well as savings from Hershey funded capital investments of the Products, except where such Hershey funded capital investments improve the overall efficiency of the Callebaut facility whereby Callebaut third-party volume may also benefit from such investments.  Hershey's share of the resulting productivity efforts shall be in the form of conversion cost reductions or Established Yield improvements.
 
 
I.         
Supply of Ingredients and Packaging
 
                            1.        For Callebaut Raw Materials, Callebaut will issue its purchase orders directly with suppliers, and will honor all payment terms of the suppliers on a timely basis, except in the case of a good faith dispute. Callebaut will use only suppliers that have been previously approved in writing by Hershey for the Products.  Hershey shall in no way be a party to or responsible for Callebauts contracts for Callebaut Raw Materials.
 
2.         For Hershey Raw Materials, Hershey shall, at its option, either invoice Callebaut or direct the supplier to invoice Callebaut directly, and Callebaut shall pay any amount due Hershey hereunder following receipt of Hersheys invoice on terms of net twenty-three (23) days from date of receipt of invoice plus a seven day grace period to enable weekly groupings of payments or shall pay within the suppliers stated terms, except, in each instance, in the case of a good faith dispute.
 
3.         With Hersheys prior approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, Callebaut may source ingredients and packaging from other Callebaut divisions at prevailing market rates.  The Parties recognize that Hershey has existing contractual obligations for the procurement of Cocoa Ingredients at the date of this Agreement.  Upon the expiration of these contractual commitments, Hershey will source Cocoa Ingredients from Callebaut for the Robinson Facility as long as Callebaut meets Hersheys product specifications, quality requirements, time requirements, commercial cost assumptions, capacity and volume requirements, and geographic need.  Hershey will source Cocoa Ingredients from Callebaut for the Monterrey facility from the start of production as long as Callebaut meets Hersheys product specifications, quality requirements, time requirements, commercial cost assumptions, capacity and volume requirements, and geographic need.
 
4.         Where commercially reasonable, the Hershey Raw Materials volumes shall only be used in the Products and Callebaut agrees not to use Hershey Raw Materials volumes in any other product it may produce.  Should it not be commercially reasonable to ensure that Hershey Raw Materials are used solely in the Products (e.g. due to common silos, manufacturing processes, etc.), Hershey shall nonetheless receive the benefit of use of raw materials of equal quality and specification in the manufacture of the Products and in pricing on invoices received from Callebaut.
 
5.         Callebaut shall inspect and sample all Hershey Raw Materials and Callebaut Raw Materials for conformance with Hershey's Specifications and shall reject and withhold from use in the manufacture of the Products any Hershey Raw Materials or Callebaut Raw Materials determined by Callebaut not to be in conformity with such Hershey Specifications.  Callebaut will maintain available line capacity and inventories of ingredients and packaging materials in sufficient amounts to support the production requirements of the Products set forth on the Shipment Plan issued by Hershey to Callebaut. Callebaut acknowledges that certain ingredients used in the products have a limited shelf life.  Callebaut agrees to utilize the ingredients in such a manner as to utilize first those ingredients which have been in inventory the longest.
 
 
J.         
Quality Assurance
 
1.         Without limiting its warranties herein, Callebaut shall manufacture the Products and perform the sampling and testing procedures for the Products in accordance with the Hershey Specifications.
 
 
2.         All Products delivered by Callebaut to Hershey under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the Hershey Specifications, applicable laws and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration, the United States Public Health Service, Mexicos Ministry of Health, Canadian Regulatory Agency Requirements, and any and all other applicable United States, Canadian and Mexican federal, state and local laws and regulations.  All water used in connection with the Products, whether it be for processing or cleaning, shall meet the United States Environmental Protection Agency and applicable Canadian and Mexican safe drinking water standards.  All required testing will be done at Callebaut's expense, which expense shall be included as part of the conversion fee charged by Callebaut, however, Hershey shall reimburse Callebaut separate and apart from the conversion cost for all third-party testing expense, if any, incurred by Callebaut between the date of this Agreement and December 31, 2007 while the Parties work towards the certification of the Callebaut-owned labs.  Should such certification be delayed beyond December 31, 2007 due to the action or inaction of Hershey, the final reimbursement date will be extended until such date as the Callebaut-owned labs are so certified.  Should, however, such certification be delayed because of Callebaut failing to provide Hershey with necessary information or Callebauts failure to implement remedial actions, if any, validly identified by Hershey, Callebaut will be responsible for any third-party testing expense incurred after December 31, 2007.  Should Hershey change the Hershey Specifications at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Parties will negotiate in good faith any required adjustment to conversion costs.
 
3.         Callebaut warrants that (i) it will perform under this Agreement in accordance with all the terms hereof, (ii) that its processing of the Products hereunder shall be in accordance with the highest standards prescribed by the Good Manufacturing Practices regulations promulgated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, all applicable United States, Canadian and Mexican laws and regulations and Hershey's Specifications, and (iii) that all Products, when delivered to Hershey, will comply with Hersheys Specifications, shall not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the United States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act), applicable Canadian and Mexican law, and regulations promulgated thereunder, and shall not be articles which may not, under the provisions of Section 404 or 505 of the Act, be introduced into interstate commerce.
 
4.         Callebaut shall reimburse Hershey for any costs or losses incurred by Hershey as a result of any Product rejected by Hershey for failure to conform to the requirements of this Agreement.  Callebaut's obligation under the prior sentence shall include reimbursing Hershey for all reasonable cleaning, transportation, retrieval, storage and destruction costs caused by the defective Product.  The above remedies are not exclusive and, subject to the provisions of Section 10(F), Hershey shall be entitled to all remedies hereunder and allowed by law.  Callebaut shall not be required to remedy any defects or discrepancies caused substantially by inherent defects in Hershey's Specifications.  All major incidents shall be reported to the Steering Committee at the quarterly meeting following the incident.
 
 
5.         Callebaut shall remove any Product rejected by Hershey or not otherwise meeting the requirements of this Agreement in accordance with Hershey's reasonable instructions.  Rejected Product sourced under any Supply Agreement that has already been packaged by Hershey into finished product shall be disposed of in accordance with Hersheys reasonable instructions.  The method of disposition of rejected Products sourced under either the Mexico Supply Agreement or the Robinson Supply Agreement that has not already been packaged by Hershey into finished product shall be at Callebauts discretion.  With Hersheys prior approval, and provided that Callebaut can meet Hershey Specifications and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, rejected Products may be blended into future Products sold to Hershey.  Callebaut may also blend any such rejected Product into any other products for third-party volume at a rate of 5%, or such greater rate as may be approved by Hershey.   Callebaut will be responsible for the cost of normal disposal of Product rejected for failure to satisfy the requirements of this Agreement.
 
6.         Upon reasonable notice, and during Callebaut's normal operations, Callebaut shall permit Hershey or its designees access to Callebaut's facilities utilized in the receiving, handling, packaging and storage of packaging, ingredients and Products for the purpose of ascertaining Callebaut's compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices and Hershey Specifications and quality assurance requirements, provided however, that unless permitted under another agreement between the Parties, Hershey shall not have access to any part of Callebaut's facilities which are not used directly in the manufacture of Products or the receiving, storage, handling or packaging of any Products or ingredients or which are subject to limited access by agreement of the Parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Callebaut shall have the final responsibility for complying with all requirements of this Agreement, the Hershey Specifications, Good Manufacturing Practices and other legal requirements.  Callebaut shall promptly notify Hershey of any material discrepancies noted during any inspection of Callebaut's production facilities by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the United States Public Health Service, Canadian Regulatory Authority, Mexicos Ministry of Health, any state or any other legally authorized federal, state or local regulatory agency and shall also provide Hershey a list of any discrepancies noted by any authorities relating to the manufacture, packaging and storage by Callebaut of the Products, the ingredients and the packaging materials.
 
7.         Callebaut shall keep complete, true and accurate records with respect to compliance with the requirements of the Hershey Specifications set forth on Exhibit A.  Callebaut shall allow Hershey or its designees reasonable access to these records insofar as they relate to the Products, potential product recalls, potential product claims and government inquiries.  These records will be maintained for a period of not less than 6 years.
 
8.         Callebaut represents that it has registered its facilities as required under the United States Food and Drug Administration Bioterrorism Act.  Callebaut will remain in compliance with such Act through the term of this Agreement.  Callebaut agrees to contact Hershey promptly (but in no event later than one hour after Callebaut knows or should have known of the incident) if any of the Callebaut facilities used for the production of any Product are affected by security violation, theft or other incident that is reasonably likely to impair Product integrity.
 
 
9.         The Parties incorporate the Product Guaranty and Indemnity Agreement attached as Exhibit E into this Agreement.
 
 
K.         
Delivery, Title Transfer, Risk of Loss and Insurance
 
1.         Delivery terms, transfer of title to and risk of loss of the Products are addressed in each of the Supply Agreements.
 
2.         Callebaut shall carry and maintain Insurance coverage as defined in Exhibit C.  The limits specified in Exhibit C are based upon factors existing at the commencement of this Agreement.  The Parties agree that these limits may be increased or decreased, by mutual agreement, throughout the term of this Agreement.  Should an increase in insurance coverage be required, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith any required adjustments to the calendar year pricing for the Products, effective for the January to December period following the increase in coverage.  Hershey shall be named as additional named insured on each of the foregoing policies.  Callebaut shall pay all premiums when due and within such period of time as is necessary to keep such insurance in full force and effect.  Current certificates of insurance shall be provided to Hershey to evidence the coverage required by this Section 2(K)(2).  Such certificates shall provide for thirty (30) days advance written notice to Hershey of any cancellation of the relevant policy and Callebaut shall provide thirty (30) days advance written notice of any material change to the relevant policy.
 
 
 
A Steering Committee shall be established to assess performance and address issues arising under this Agreement and the Related Agreements.  Each Party shall assign representatives from their management teams to guide the relationship between the Parties, ensure compliance with this Agreement and the Related Agreements, resolve issues and disputes, measure and assess performance, and evaluate proposals from either side.  At least one senior executive or officer of each Party shall participate on the Steering Committee.  The respective individuals from each Party responsible for production, quality, logistics and pricing are expected to attend Steering Committee meetings.  The Steering Committee will meet quarterly. A Party wishing to modify or amend any provision of any agreement between the Parties may submit the proposed change to the Steering Committee for its consideration along with the basis for the proposal, any adjustment in costs or schedules of delivery of Products resulting from the change, and any other impact of the change, to the other Party.  No change will be accepted until agreed upon by both Parties in writing and signed by each Party.
 
 
 
A.         Both Parties agree to develop two-way performance metrics by which performance under this Agreement will be evaluated.  A scorecard with key performance indicators and metrics will be jointly developed by September 30, 2007 (the Performance Scorecard).  Performance bands will be set forth as follows on the Performance Scorecard for the determination of aggregate average quarterly scores: (i) Acceptable; (ii) Immediate action; and (iii) Unacceptable.   For purposes of clarity, the Parties both acknowledge that an Unacceptable rating will result in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of Products arising from Callebauts action or inaction under this Agreement.
 
 
B.         Prior to each Steering Committee meeting, each Party will complete their respective Performance Scorecard for both their and the other Partys performance over the past three, six and twelve months.  Performance Scorecard reports will be reviewed at the quarterly Steering Committee meeting.  If the Steering Committee identifies issues that need improvement, the responsible Party will provide corrective action plans and results within a reasonable amount of time commensurate with the severity of the issue.  The Performance Scorecard shall be developed in sufficient form and content to clearly define those key performance indicators which, if not achieved, would constitute a breach under the terms of this Agreement or the Supply Agreements.
 
 
 
A.         The parties agree to the Non-Compete provisions set forth in Exhibit F.
 
 
 
Except as expressly permitted in any related agreement the Parties agree not to solicit the other Partys employees for employment.

C.         Trade Secret Information shall mean that information of a Party which that Party considers to be confidential and proprietary in nature which relates to the product and ingredient formulas and production processes which are critical to the ongoing and future business of such Party, the unauthorized disclosure or use of which could result in materially adverse technical and/or commercial results to that Party whether disclosed in writing, orally or by observation (including without limitation by e-mail or other electronic communication).
 
D.         Any Confidential Information disclosed or otherwise disseminated from one Party (hereafter, the Disclosing Party) to the other Party (hereafter, the Receiving Party) whether such information is conveyed orally or in written form (including without limitation by e-mail or other electronic communication) or by observation or in any other manner, shall be treated and regarded as confidential and proprietary information, which is the exclusive and sole property of the Disclosing Party in accordance with the following provisions:
 
1.           Each Partys obligations with respect to the Confidential Information of the other Party shall apply with respect to any Confidential Information covered by and disclosed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Innovation Agreement and the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreements between the Parties dated April 10, 2007, March 16, 2006 and December 21, 2005, which Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreements are hereby superseded.
 
2.           All Trade Secret Information disclosed or otherwise provided to a Receiving Party hereunder after the date of this Agreement shall either (i) be disclosed in writing (including electronic documents) bearing a legend or other statement that the disclosed information is classified as Confidential by the Disclosing Party; or (ii) with respect to information provided orally or by providing access to restricted areas for observation purposes, subsequently identified as Confidential by the Disclosing Party in a written document and provided to the Receiving Party within thirty (30) days of disclosure.  All product and ingredient formulas and production processes of one Party received by the other Party relating to the Products shall be deemed Trade Secrets unless otherwise explicitly specified by the Disclosing Party at the time of the disclosure.  The Parties agree to work through the Research Committee with respect to disclosure of Trade Secrets pertaining to the Innovation Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Innovation Agreement.  If the Receiving Party disagrees with the identification of a Trade Secret set forth in any Disclosing Party documentation, it shall raise such issue with the Research Committee as defined in the Innovation Agreement and the Research Committee shall revise the identification as may be necessary to satisfy both the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party consistent with the collaborative spirit of the Innovation Agreement.  Proprietary Information may also bear a legend or other statement classifying the information as CONFIDENTIAL but such designation will not cause such Proprietary Information to be treated as Trade Secret Information.
 
3.           In addition to the foregoing obligations with respect to treatment of Confidential Information, the Parties shall also comply with any protocols, conditions and other restrictions imposed by the Research Committee with respect to handling, retention and dissemination of Confidential Information of a Party, including any procedures intended to facilitate return of such Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party.
 
4.

A Receiving Party shall permit disclosure of such Confidential Information only to such of its directors, officers, employees, contractors (other than competitors of the Disclosing Party), and advisors who need such information for the purpose of implementing this Agreement and the agreements which are exhibits hereto, provided that such Persons are subject to confidentiality and use restrictions equivalent to those contained herein.  If a Receiving Party desires to share Confidential Information with a Person outside of the scope of this Agreement, it shall first obtain the consent of the Disclosing Party.  A Receiving Party shall use at least such efforts to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential
 
Information as it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information, but in no event shall a Receiving Party use less than commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such confidentiality.  Callebaut agrees that Hersheys proprietary flavors and essences disclosed pursuant to the April 10, 2007 Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be considered to be Trade Secret Information and it will not chemically analyze, reverse engineer and disassemble such flavors and essences.  Callebaut acknowledges that the formulas and non-public processes disclosed in connection with Callebauts production of semi-sweet chocolate chips for sale to Hershey are Hershey Trade Secrets.
 
5.           A Receiving Party shall not utilize Trade Secret Information it has received from a Disclosing Party in any manner, except for the limited purposes authorized in this Agreement or the agreements which are Exhibits hereto, provided that Confidential Information that is an Innovation shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of the Innovation Agreement.  Otherwise, Proprietary Information, which is not an Innovation, may be freely used but not disclosed except as otherwise permitted hereunder by the Parties.
 
6.           These obligations of confidentiality and restrictions on use of Confidential Information shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years, except for Trade Secret Information which shall remain subject to obligations of confidentiality and restrictions on use indefinitely.  Upon the later of (i) the termination or expiration of this Agreement and (ii) the termination or expiration of a Receiving Partys authorization to use specific Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall return all documents and other materials containing Confidential Information that were disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Disclosing Party together with all copies and other embodiments thereof or otherwise dispose of such documents and materials (including without limitation deletion or destruction of electronic data) in accordance with the Disclosing Partys written direction.  In the event of inadvertent disclosure of Trade Secret Information, the Disclosing Party shall have the right and obligation to promptly request return of such Trade Secret Information and the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to promptly collect and return all such Trade Secret Information.
 
7.           The obligations herein concerning Confidential information of the Parties under this Agreement shall not pertain to information which: (i) is generally known to the public at the time of its disclosure or becomes generally available to the public at any time thereafter, (ii) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party who has the right to disclose such information, (iii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure under this Agreement, or (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.
 
8.           In the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section 7, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining the breaching Party from disclosing, in whole or in part, any of the above-referenced information or from rendering any service to any person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity to whom such information has been disclosed or is threatened to be disclosed.

Notwithstanding anything else herein, the Parties acknowledge that certain Residual Information disclosed as part of the Parties collaborative efforts under the Innovation Agreement may be retained within their respective companies, including, without limitation the minds of employees and data systems, and subsequently used by a Receiving Party even though the Receiving Party has used its commercially reasonable efforts to refrain from using and to destroy or return such Residual Information to the Disclosing Party and complied with any protocols, conditions and other restrictions imposed by the Research Committee with respect to handling, retention and dissemination of Confidential Information.   The Parties agree that they will not bring any legal actions or proceedings against one another arising from such use of Residual Information exchanged under the operation of the Innovation Agreement.  Residual Information shall mean such Confidential Information provided from a Disclosing Party which in documentary form (including, without limitation, written, graphic or electronic form), is retained in the files of a Party after it has used reasonable efforts to locate any and all copies and disseminations thereof and which do not on their face indicate that they are the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, and such Confidential Information retained in the minds/memories of employees and other permissible Persons which Confidential Information has not been specifically and intentionally committed to memory.

Callebaut and Hershey may collectively be referred to herein as the Parties.
 
 
BACKGROUND
 
This Supply Agreement for Monterrey, Mexico (hereinafter this Agreement) is subject to the terms and conditions found in the Master Innovation and Supply Agreement between Hershey and Callebaut of even date herewith (the Master Agreement).  This Agreement further specifies the terms pursuant to which Callebaut will manufacture the products specified in Exhibit I-M at its Monterrey, Mexico facility (the Products) for Hershey.  Callebaut has indicated its ability and intent to manufacture the Products for Hershey in accordance with the terms and conditions specified herein. Defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Master Agreement.
 
, with the intent to be legally bound and in consideration of the mutual promises herein set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the Parties hereby agree as follows:
NOW THEREFORE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Callebaut must exercise the Put Option within two years from the date Hersheys annual orders from Monterrey fall below the Minimum Threshold Volume threshold (the Put Period).  The purchase of the facility must be completed within one year of the exercise of the Put Option. During the Put Period operations will continue pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
 
With Hersheys consent, Callebaut may sell its capacity between the volume set forth in Exhibit VIII-M (Target Volume) pounds and Hersheys forecasted volume.  Hersheys overhead burden will be reduced proportionately by the incremental sales attained by Callebaut.  Callebaut will also use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce its costs in order to reduce the overhead burden assigned to Hershey.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Callebaut will maintain a structure that enables Callebaut to pass on duty free and value added tax (VAT) free equipment, ingredient and material costs to Hershey as allowable under current applicable laws and regulations.
 
If for any reason Callebaut is required to pay duties or value added tax on any equipment, ingredients or components of the Products, other than as a result of a change in any applicable law or regulations, Callebaut agrees not to pass those costs on to Hershey.
 
In the event a change in any such law or regulation pertaining to the duty and value added tax (VAT) free structure should occur that results in an economic impact necessitating Hersheys cessation of its chocolate activities in its Monterrey facility, Hershey may terminate its obligations under this Agreement.  Callebaut may exercise the Put Option set forth in Section 2(B) within three months of the termination.  Should Callebaut choose not to exercise its Put Option, Callebaut may purchase the land leased to it by Hershey at fair market value.  In addition, upon such cessation of Hersheys chocolate activities in its Monterrey facility, the Parties agree to jointly evaluate the Parties ongoing strategic relationship for the source of supply of those Products previously sourced from the Monterrey facilities, including sourcing from and investment in alternative locations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On or before August 31, 2007 the Parties anticipate executing a lease agreement (the Lease Agreement), whereby Hershey will lease to Callebaut (or its Mexican subsidiary) land to be identified in the lease (the Leased Premises) upon which Callebaut will construct its Monterrey facility.  The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith the terms of the Lease Agreement and use commercially reasonable efforts to execute the Lease Agreement on or before August 31, 2007.  In the event a Lease Agreement is not executed on or before August 31, 2007, either Party may terminate this Agreement, and if so terminated neither Party shall have any further obligation to the other hereunder.
 
 
Exhibit IV-M lists the Hershey infrastructure which Hershey has agreed to make available to Callebaut, in exchange for the payment described on the Exhibit IV-M, to enable Callebauts access to certain utilities and services for its Monterrey facility. The Parties agree that the Lease Agreement will reflect which part of Hersheys utility infrastructure Callebaut wishes to utilize (at the costs specified on Exhibit IV-M hereto), and any ongoing maintenance or usage costs associated therewith.  Payment for any one-time costs will be made by Callebaut to Hershey within 30 days after signing of the Monterrey Lease Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
Callebaut will have the process and equipment capabilities set forth on Exhibit VIII-M.
 
 
Upon reasonable notice, and during either Party's normal hours of operation, either Party shall be granted access to the other Party's facilities utilized in the receiving, manufacturing, handling, packaging and storage of packaging, ingredients and Products for the purpose of ascertaining either Party's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Master Agreement, as pertains to compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, Quality Assurance and Hersheys Specifications; provided, however, that unless permitted either Party shall not have access to any part of either Party's facilities which are not used directly in the manufacture of Products or the receiving, storage, handling or packaging of any Products or ingredients or which are subject to limited access by agreement of the Parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hershey acknowledges the requirement for the Callebaut facility to remain allergen free and Hershey will take necessary precautions when accessing the Callebaut facility.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the conclusion of each of the calendar years during the Term, should actual volume differ from the Annual Estimate and fall into a conversion cost tier other than the one charged, Hershey will be debited or credited the difference in total annual conversion costs with cash settlement in accordance with the terms of the Master Agreement, or the Parties can mutually agree to roll over the variance for inclusion in the cost base to be invoiced to Hershey by Callebaut for Products purchased in the next calendar year.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Termination rights are set forth in the Master Agreement.
 
 
In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement, or of a change in control of Callebaut described in the Master Agreement to which Hershey does not consent,  Hershey  shall have a right to acquire Callebauts Monterrey facility and the equipment required to manufacture Products for Hershey   at fair market value to be determined by a mutually agreed upon valuation process. Should Hershey exercise such purchase, (i) an eighteen (18) month period (either before the end of the Term or at the time of notice) will be given to Callebaut to allow time to build a new facility to maintain business continuity and (ii) the Parties will agree on any future employment of Callebauts employees working at the Monterrey facility at the end of the eighteen month notice period.  If notice is given at the time of termination, the Parties shall continue to operate under the terms and conditions of the Master Agreement and this Agreement for the duration of such notification period.  Ownership of any equipment not acquired by Hershey will be retained by Callebaut and such equipment will be removed at Callebauts cost in accordance with an agreed upon schedule.  In the event Hershey chooses to sell its Monterrey facility to a third party (and not as part of an acquisition or joint venture) or Hershey chooses not to exercise its right to acquire Callebauts Monterrey facility, Callebaut shall have a right to acquire the Leased Premises at fair market value to be determined by a mutually agreed upon valuation process, subject to Hersheys continued ownership of the water rights attributable to the Leased Premises; provided that Hershey or the purchaser of its facility, as a condition of the sale agreement with Hershey, continues to make water available to the Callebaut facility on substantially the same terms and to the same extent as Hershey was providing any water prior to such transfer. In the event Hershey does not exercise its right to purchase the Callebaut facility and Callebaut does not exercise its right to purchase the land, the Lease Agreement will be extended for an agreed upon term on terms no less favourable than those contained in the Lease Agreement.
 
 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 3(A), Callebaut shall pay all federal, state and local taxes, charges, duties, fees and assessments which may be levied in connection with Callebaut's performance of this Agreement except for charges or assessments resulting from Callebaut's violations of any laws or regulations which were the result of Callebaut's adherence to the Hershey Specifications or directions or caused by Callebaut's use of Hershey supplied ingredients. In the event of a charge or assessment resulting from adherence to Hersheys Specifications, directions, or Hershey supplied ingredients, Hershey will be responsible for resolving the assessment or charge in accordance with applicable laws at its cost.
 
WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has executed this Agreement by its duly authorized representatives as of the date and year first above written.
