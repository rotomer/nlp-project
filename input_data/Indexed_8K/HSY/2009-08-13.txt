ITEM: Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers: Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
 
 
 
Following a decision by the Board of Directors to establish a Finance and Risk Management Committee that also delegated to such Committee responsibilities with respect to reviewing and monitoring the Companys annual plan and certain strategic matters including but not limited to acquisitions and dispositions, Messrs. Langbo and Strauss decided to resign from the Board of Directors based on their views, expressed before the committee was established, that retaining responsibility for these matters with the Board of Directors as a whole was a better corporate governance structure for the Company.
Arnold G. Langbo and Charles B. Strauss resigned from the Board of Directors of The Hershey Company (Company) effective August 10, 2009.  
 
 
Mr. Langbo served as chair of the Compensation and Executive Organization Committee of the Board of Directors and was a member of the Executive Committee of the Board at the time of his resignation.  Mr. Strauss was chair of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and was a member of the Compensation and Executive Organization Committee and the Executive Committee of the Board at the time of his resignation.  The Board of Directors has appointed Robert F. Cavanaugh, a current independent member of the Board, as chair of the Compensation and Executive Organization Committee and David L. Shedlarz, a current independent member of the Board, as chair of the Audit Committee.  Pursuant to their appointments as chairs of Board committees, Messrs. Cavanaugh and Shedlarz will also become members of the Executive Committee.
