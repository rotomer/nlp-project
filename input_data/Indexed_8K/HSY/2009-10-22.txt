Third Quarter Performance and Outlook
 
Im pleased with Hersheys third quarter results, which were driven by core brand growth, solid performance within key retail channels and strong productivity gains, said David J. West, President and Chief Executive Officer. Net sales, down slightly in the quarter versus the prior year, were in-line with our expectations as were lapping the buy-in related to the August 2008 price increase.  Importantly, U.S. retail takeaway for the 12-weeks ended October 3, 2009, in channels that account for over 80 percent of our U.S. retail business, was up 4.8 percent. In the channels measured by syndicated data, U.S. market share was flat for the 12-weeks ended October 3, 2009, and up 0.3 points year-to-date.  These results were driven by the investments we have made behind our core brands, including advertising, up about 50 percent in the third quarter.
 
Increased levels of in-store programming and merchandising, as well as outstanding execution at the retail level, continue to drive our positive marketplace results in the food, convenience and mass classes of trade. Well continue to invest in our brands and business capabilities and anticipate a solid finish to the year.
 
As anticipated, in the third quarter, net sales gains from the U.S. pricing action were offset by volume declines associated with pricing elasticity, the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and previously communicated 2009 mid-year actions to discontinue certain premium chocolate products. Overall, the investments we made in selling capabilities were successful in the quarter and contributed to consumer acceptance of the new higher everyday, promoted and seasonal price points.
 
 Adjusted income before interest and income taxes increased 15.8 percent in the third quarter, slightly greater than our expectations, and resulted in a 280 basis point margin improvement. The increase was driven by net price realization, supply chain efficiencies and productivity gains.  Offsetting a portion of these gains were higher commodity and employee-related costs, including pension expense. Additionally, our earnings growth, as well as our focus on improving net trading capital, generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter.
 
 
 
 
We are working closely with retail customers and are monitoring category and Hershey brand performance given the higher promoted price points of seasonal candy.  Well make the necessary consumer investments in the coming weeks and months to ensure a healthy category and Halloween and Holiday sell through at the retail level.  Halloween-specific seasonal promotions, merchandising and advertising are currently being executed in the marketplace.  We are also planning an additional increase in advertising in the fourth quarter and expect full-year 2009 advertising expense to increase about 50 percent versus 2008. This investment will benefit our everyday and seasonal business in the near term and into next year, as well as the December launches of white chocolate and the introduction of , and . These Hershey favorites, in a crunchy candy shell, are an expansion of the popular format and will be available in take-home, resealable, standup pouches. These two launches represent the type of close-in innovation on our iconic brands that we believe resonate with consumers in this challenging environment.

In the fourth quarter, gains from pricing will not be as significant as the Holiday season is smaller than Halloween.  Additionally, due to timing, we expect shipments of Valentines and Easter seasonal product to be lower in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 2008. Based on the year-to-date price/volume elasticity trends and brand-building and marketplace initiatives for the remainder of the year, we expect 2009 net sales growth to be within our 3 to 5 percent long-term objective.  Over the balance of the year, were accelerating domestic and international investments in consumer capabilities, customer insights and category management techniques that will benefit the Company over the long term. Therefore, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share-diluted for the full-year to be in the $2.12 to $2.14 range.
 
As we look to 2010, we assume the economic environment for consumers in the U.S. and international markets will continue to be challenging. Well continue to focus on and make appropriate investments in our core brands and expect 2010 net sales growth to be within our 3 to 5 percent long-term objective. The sell through at retail for Halloween will be greatly affected by the remaining days in the season and will determine our approach to the upcoming Holiday, Valentines and Easter seasons, all of which we expect will be at the higher seasonal promoted price points. While still early, for 2010, given our current views of our investments, marketplace performance and cost structure, we expect growth in adjusted earnings per share-diluted to be within our long-term objective of 6 to 8 percent, West concluded.

Appendix A
 
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88, (as amended) (now FASB Accounting Standards Codification 715-30-35) (SFAS No. 88) requires pension settlement charges to be recorded if withdrawals from pension plans in a calendar year exceed a certain level.
Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits
 
Pension settlement charges are non-cash charges for the Company. Such charges accelerate the recognition of pension expenses related to actuarial gains and losses resulting from interest rate changes and differences in actual versus assumed returns on pension assets. The Company normally amortizes actuarial gains and losses over a period of about 13 years.
 
The GSCT program charges recorded in 2007 and 2008 included pension settlement charges of approximately $25 million as employees leaving the Company under the program have withdrawn lump sums from the defined benefit pension plans.  Pension settlement charges recorded during the first nine months of 2009 totaled approximately $36.7 million.
 
In addition to the settlement charges reflected above, incremental SFAS No. 88 pension settlement charges of $30 million to $40 million are included in the total GSCT program estimates based upon the current trends of employee withdrawals, with approximately $30 million of this amount projected for 2009.
 
The GSCT program is expected to result in total pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs of $640 million to $665 million, including estimated pension settlement charges in 2009 and 2010.
