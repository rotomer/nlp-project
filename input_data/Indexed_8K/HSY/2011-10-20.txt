Credit Agreement
Company
Agent
 
I am the General Counsel of the Company, and I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
 
In that connection, I have examined:
 
 (1)           the Credit Agreement and the form of Revolving Credit Notes of the Company;
 
 (2)           the documents furnished by the Company pursuant to Article III of the Credit Agreement;
 
 (3)           the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and all amendments thereto (the ""); and
Charter
 
 (4)           The by-laws of the Company and all amendments thereto (the "").
By-laws
 
I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company, and agreements, instruments and other documents, as I have deemed necessary as a
 
 
G-1 
 
basis for the opinions expressed below.  In making such examinations, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those on behalf of the Company), the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photographic copies.  As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of the Company or its officers or of public officials and as to questions of fact and law, on opinions or statements by other lawyers reporting to me.  I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial Lenders and the Agent.
 
My opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and, where applicable, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal law of the United States.
 
Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:
 
1.           The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
2.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and, if requested, the Notes, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Company's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (including, without limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or (iii) to the best of my knowledge, any contractual or legal restriction binding on or affecting the Company, except where such contravention would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes of the Company have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company.
 
3.           No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, except for the authorizations, approvals, actions, notices and filings (i) listed on Schedule 4.01(c) to the Credit Agreement, all of which have been duly obtained, taken, given or made and are in full force and effect and (ii) where the Company's failure to receive, take, give or make such authorization, approval, action, notice or filing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
4.           There are no pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened actions, investigations, litigation or proceedings against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that (a) would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) purport to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.

and to Bank of America, N.A., as Agent
for said Lenders
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:

Designated

Morgan Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.  In connection therewith, I have also examined the following documents:

Credit Agreement
Company
Agent
 
(i)           The Designation Letter (as defined in the Credit Agreement) executed by the Designated Subsidiary.
 
[such other documents as counsel may wish to refer to]
 
I have also reviewed such matters of law and examined the original, certified, conformed or photographic copies of such other documents, records, agreements and certificates as I have considered relevant hereto.  As to questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established by us, relied upon certificates of the Designated Subsidiary or of its officers or of public officials and as to questions of fact and law, on opinions or statements by other lawyers reporting to me.  I have assumed (i) the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of each of the documents referred to above by all parties thereto other than the Designated Subsidiary, (ii) the authenticity of all such documents submitted to us as originals and (iii) the conformity to originals of all such documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photographic copies.
 
My opinions expressed below are limited to ________________ and the State of New York.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:
H-1
 
 
 
1.           The Designated Subsidiary (a) is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of _________________________, (b) is duly qualified in each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases property or in which the conduct of its business requires it to so qualify or be licensed and (c) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted.
2.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Designated Subsidiary of its Designation Letter, the Credit Agreement and its Revolving Credit Notes, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Designated Subsidiary's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) any provision of the charter or by-laws or other constituent documents of the Designated Subsidiary, (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Designated Subsidiary or (iii) any contractual or legal obligation or restriction binding on or affecting the Designated Subsidiary, except where such contravention would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Designation Letter and each Revolving Credit Note of the Designated Subsidiary has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Designated Subsidiary.
3.           The Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary, the Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes of the Designated Subsidiary are, and each other Note of the Designated Subsidiary when executed and delivered under the Credit Agreement will be, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Designated Subsidiary enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or other similar laws relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except that I express no opinion as to (i) the subject matter jurisdiction of the District Courts of the United States of America to adjudicate any controversy relating to the Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary or (ii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction (other than the State of New York) wherein any Lender or Applicable Lending Office may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary may be sought which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected by such Lender.
4.           There is no pending, or to the best of my knowledge, threatened action, investigation, litigation or proceeding at law or in equity against the Designated Subsidiary before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or that purports to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Designation Letter of the Designated Subsidiary, the Credit Agreement or any Revolving Credit Note of the Designated Subsidiary, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
H-2
 
 
 
5.           No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Designated Subsidiary of its Designation Letter, the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary except for such authorizations, consents, approvals, actions, notices or filings as have heretofore been made, obtained or affected and are in full force and effect.
This opinion letter may be relied upon by you only in connection with the transaction being consummated pursuant to the Credit Agreement and may not be used or relied upon by any other person for any other purpose.
 
Very truly yours,
