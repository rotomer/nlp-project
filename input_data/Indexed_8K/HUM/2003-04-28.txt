LOUISVILLE, KY (April 28, 2003) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 and comparative amounts for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 as follows:
              (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     Driven by improved adjusted earnings in the company's Commercial segment, first quarter 2003 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $.31 increased 11 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the first quarter improved 7 percent compared to that for the same period in the prior year. The adjusted pretax margin of 2.7 percent increased 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2002.
     "Our adjusted Commercial segment pretax earnings for the first quarter exceeded those for all of 2002. We believe this is a clear demonstration of our growing ability to improve Commercial profitability," said Michael B. McCallister, chief executive officer. "Humana's innovative products and rigorous operating discipline, supported by streamlining of administrative expenses, should result in a substantial improvement in our Commercial segment results for 2003. Our Government segment profitability complemented the Commercial segment improvement in the quarter."
     
Restructuring Charge
     During the first quarter of 2003, the company recorded the following items that were not reflective of the run-rate operations of the company. These adjustments, which are reflected in the restructuring charge line in the Statement of Income, were described initially in the company's press release, dated December 5, 2002, and again in the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. Management believes this restructuring charge should be excluded to properly reflect the run-rate operations of the company and to provide better comparability to prior year results.
                        (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     
Segment Results
     Pretax results and margins for the company's business segments for the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
                    (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
                    (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     
Revenues and Membership
     Consolidated revenues and membership for the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
                             (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     Commercial segment premiums and administrative services fees and membership for the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
                            (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     Commercial segment medical membership grew by 2 percent from March 31, 2002 to March 31, 2003. Commercial premium yields were within the 13 to 15 percent range for first quarter of 2003. These factors contributed to a year-over-year increase in total premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial segment of 13 percent for the first quarter 2003.
     Government segment premiums and administrative services fees and membership for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 were as follows:
                              (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     Government segment premiums and administrative services fees were essentially unchanged year-over-year for the first quarter of 2003.
     Medicare+Choice membership totaled 327,100 at March 31, 2003, a decline of 36,600 members year over year. Medicare+Choice premium yields for the first quarter were within the 4 to 6 percent range.
     TRICARE's insured membership totaled 1,752,500 at March 31, 2003, approximately 1 percent higher than the March 31, 2002 level. TRICARE ASO membership was 1,050,800 at the end of the first quarter of 2003, up approximately 5 percent year over year. TRICARE premium revenues and administrative services fees increased year-over-year by 6 percent during the first quarter of 2003. These increases in TRICARE revenues primarily are attributable to Congressionally legislated benefit changes, an increase in eligible beneficiaries, and a decrease in the use of military treatment facilities.
     Medicaid membership of 491,400 at March 31, 2003 grew by approximately 3 percent from March 31, 2002. Approximately 85 percent of the company's Medicaid membership is in Puerto Rico.
     
Medical and SG&A Expenses
     The company's medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premiums) and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums and administrative services fees) for the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
                                   (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     
Cash flows from operations
     Cash flows provided by (used in) operations for the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
                                    (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     
Share Repurchase Program
     In July 2002, the company announced a $100 million share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2003, 8.6 million shares had been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $94.9 million, an average price of $10.98 per share.
 
     
Guidance
     The company offered the following earnings guidance points for the investor community:
(See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     
Footnote Definitions
     1 - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")
     2 - Adjusted results exclude from GAAP results the impact of the restructuring charge recorded during the first quarter of 2003. The statistics pages at the end of this press release provide a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results for the first quarter of 2003. The detail of the adjustments also is described in the "Restructuring Charge" section of this press release.
     
3 - Normalized cash flows from operations give effect to the usual adjustment for the timing of the receipt of the Medicare+Choice premium payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). The fixed monthly payment from CMS is payable to Humana on the first day of each month. However, if the first of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, the company receives that payment early, often resulting in a significant impact on cash flows from operations. The statistics pages at the end of this press release provide a reconciliation of GAAP to normalized cash flows from operations.
