LOUISVILLE, KY (July 28, 2003) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003 and comparative amounts for the quarter ended June 30, 2002 as follows:
           (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          Second quarter 2003 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $.37 increased 37 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. The improvement was driven primarily by increasing operating margins in the company's Commercial segment, as well as TRICARE revenue adjustments which were both earlier and greater than had previously been expected. Adjusted net income for the second quarter improved 30 percent compared to that for the same period in the prior year. The adjusted pre-tax margin of 3.0 percent increased 60 basis points from the second quarter of 2002.
          Results for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:
           (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2003 of $.68 increased 24 percent compared to $.55 for the six months ended June 30, 2002. Net income on an adjusted basis improved 19 percent for the first half of 2003 versus the first half of 2002.
           "We are particularly pleased with this quarter's results as they provide further evidence of the soundness of our Commercial strategy," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's chief executive officer. "Humana's reputation in the Commercial segment as an innovator in solutions for employers is not only growing, it is leading to an increase in sales activity. That activity, combined with consistent pricing discipline, has helped drive the improved results for our second quarter. We anticipate our innovative products will continue to accelerate interest in all of our products and, in turn, improved results for Humana."
          
Unusual Items
          During the first half of 2003, the company recorded the following items that were not reflective of the run-rate operations of the company. Management believes these unusual items should be excluded to properly reflect the run-rate operations of the company and to provide better comparability to prior year results.
          One unusual item was recorded during the second quarter ended June 30, 2003 as follows:
        (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          Unusual items recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2003 were as follows:
         (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
     
Segment Results
     Pre-tax income and margins for the company's business segments for the second quarters and six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
            (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          
Revenues and Membership
          Consolidated revenues and membership for the second quarters and the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
            (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          Commercial segment premiums and administrative services fees and membership for the second quarters and the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
      (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          Commercial segment medical membership grew by 2.5 percent from June 30, 2002 to June 30, 2003. Commercial premium yields were within the 13 to 15 percent range for the second quarter of 2003. These factors contributed to a year-over-year increase in total premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial segment of 14 percent for the second quarter of 2003 and 13 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2003.
          Government segment premiums and administrative services fees and membership for the second quarters and the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
         (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          As expected, government segment premiums and administrative services fees decreased year-over-year by 2 percent in the second quarter of 2003 and by 1 percent during the six months ended June 30, 2003.
          Medicare+Choice membership totaled 324,200 at June 30, 2003, a decline of 29,900 members from the prior year's quarter. Medicare+Choice premium yield for the second quarter of 2003 was within the 4 to 6 percent range.
         TRICARE's insured membership totaled 1,750,800 at June 30, 2003, essentially flat versus the June 30, 2002 level. TRICARE ASO membership was 1,052,500 at the end of the second quarter of 2003, up 3 percent from the second quarter of 2002. TRICARE premium revenues and administrative services fees increased year-over-year by approximately 1 percent during the second quarter of 2003 and increased approximately 4 percent for the six months of 2003 versus the same period in the prior year.
          Medicaid membership of 492,700 at June 30, 2003 grew by approximately 1 percent from June 30, 2002. Approximately 85 percent of the company's Medicaid membership is in Puerto Rico.
          
Medical and SG&A Expenses
          The company's medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premiums) and SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums and administrative services fees) for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
(See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          The company continues to experience favorable development in its estimates of prior years' medical claims liabilities. However, management has consistently applied the same level of conservatism in its reserving methodology. Consequently, these prior year favorable developments had no favorable impact on the company's year-to-date results from operations.
          
Cash flows from operations
          Cash flows provided by (used in) operations for the second quarters and the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:
      (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          
Share Repurchase Program
          The company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $100 million for the repurchase of its common shares, replacing the outstanding share repurchase program under which the company repurchased 8.6 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $94.9 million, an average price of $10.98 per share. The company had 161.7 million shares outstanding as of June 30, 2003. The company said that the shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market or in privately-negotiated transactions.
 
          
Guidance
          The company offered the following earnings guidance for the investor community:
     (See "Footnote Definitions" section of this press release.)
          
Footnote Definitions
          1 - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")
          2 - Adjusted results exclude from GAAP results the impact of unusual items recorded during the first and second quarters of 2003. The statistics pages at the end of this press release provide a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003. The detail of the adjustments also is described in the "Unusual Items" section of this press release.
          3 - Normalized cash flows from operations give effect to the usual adjustment for the timing of the receipt of the Medicare+Choice premium payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). The fixed monthly payment from CMS is payable to Humana on the first day of each month. However, if the first of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, the company receives that payment early, often resulting in a significant impact on cash flows from operations. The statistics pages at the end of this press release provide a reconciliation of GAAP to normalized cash flows from operations.
         4 - Mathematical differences due to rounding in e
arnings per share calculations.
