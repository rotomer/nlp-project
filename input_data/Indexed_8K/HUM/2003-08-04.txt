Walter E. Neely, Vice President and Associate General Counsel to the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives its written opinion letter, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the Delivery Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
Each of the Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries have been duly incorporated, and each of the Company's Significant Subsidiaries is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdictions of incorporation, is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which its respective ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its respective businesses requires such qualification and has all power and authority necessary to own or hold its respective properties and conduct the businesses in which it is engaged;
All of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and conform to the description thereof contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002; and all of the issued shares of capital stock of each subsidiary of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid, non-assessable and (except for directors' qualifying shares or as set forth on Schedule 2 hereto) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
To such counsel's knowledge and other than as expressly set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, might have a Material Adverse Effect; and, to such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
The issuance and sale of the Notes and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Agreement and the Indenture and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is subject, or other material agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject; and
The statements contained or incorporated by reference from the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 in the Prospectus under the captions "Business-Government Regulation" and "Business-Health Care Reform," insofar as they describe federal and state statutes, rules, regulations and orders, constitute a fair summary thereof in all material respects.
At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP a letter, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the date hereof (i) confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (ii) stating, as of the date hereof (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given in the Prospectus, as of a date not more than five days prior to the date hereof), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters ordinarily covered by accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public of ferings.
With respect to the letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Representatives concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letter"), the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter (the "bring-down letter") of such accountants, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the Delivery Date (i) confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (ii) stating, as of the date of the bring-down letter (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given in the Prospectus, as of a date not more than five days prior to the date of the bring-down letter), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the f inancial information and other matters covered by the initial letter and (iii) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letter.
The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate, dated the Delivery Date, of its President and Chief Executive Officer and its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer stating that:
The representations, warranties and agreements of the Company in Section 1 that are qualified as to materiality are true and correct as of the Delivery Date and the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company in Section 1 that are not qualified as to materiality are true and correct in all material respects as of the Delivery Date; the Company has complied with all its agreements contained herein; and the conditions set forth in Section 7(a) and (j) have been fulfilled; and
They have carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and, in their opinion (A) as of the Effective Date, the Registration Statement and Prospectus included therein did not include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of such Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, (B) as of its date, the preliminary prospectus supplement did not, and as of its date and as of the Delivery Date, the Prospectus did not, include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (C) since the Effective Date no event has occurred which should have been set forth in a supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement or the Pro spectus included therein and which was not so set forth in the Prospectus.
(i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth in the Prospectus or (ii) since such date there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, in or affecting the business, properties, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth in the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisabl e to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Notes being delivered on the Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.
Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or in the over-the-counter market, or trading in any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market, shall have been suspended or materially limited or minimum prices shall have been established on any such exchange or such market by the Commission, by such exchange or by any other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York state authorities, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by any state authority (other than New York) that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering, sale or delivery of the Notes be ing delivered on the Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Prospectus, (iv) a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services has occurred, or (v) there shall have been a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering, sale or delivery of the Notes being delivered on the Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Prospectus.
No default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default shall have occurred and be continuing, or would result from the transactions contemplated hereby to occur prior to, concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of the offering of the Notes under the Indenture.
The Company and the Trustee shall have entered into the Indenture, and the Underwriters shall have received counterparts, conformed as executed, thereof, and the Notes shall have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee.
All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters.
Indemnification and Contribution.
The Companyshall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of the Notes), to which that Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or th e Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Notes or the offering contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (that the Company shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent that it is determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by such Underwriter through its negligence or willful misconduct), and shall reimburse each Underwriter and each such director, officer, employee or controllin g person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any such amendment or supplement, (x) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 8(e) or (y) if such untrue statement o r omission made in the Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus, the Prospectus was supplied to such Underwriter by the Company and such Underwriter failed to send or give, if legally required to be sent or given, a copy of the Prospectus to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage or liability. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any director, officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter.
provided
provided, however
Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not mis leading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer, employee or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person.
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure; and, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate there in and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , that the Representatives shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Representatives and those other Underwriters and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under this Section 8 if, in the reasonable judgment of the Representativ es, it is advisable for the Representatives and those Underwriters, officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unr easonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
provided, however
provided further,
provided, however
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Notes purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, no Underwriter shall be required to contri bute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company acknowledges that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Notes by the Underwriters set forth in the last paragraph on the cover page of, and the fifth, ninth and eleventh paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Prospectus Supplement.
.
Defaulting Underwriters
If, on the Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on the Delivery Date in the respective proportions which the aggregate principal amount of Notes set opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto bears to the total aggregate principal amount of Notes set opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto; , that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes on the Delivery Date if the total aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on the Delivery Date, and any remaining non-def aulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes which it agreed to purchase on the Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 2. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Notes to be purchased on the Delivery Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives do not elect to purchase Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on the Delivery Date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses of the non-defaulting Underwriters to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 11. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule 1 hereto who, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases the Notes which a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
provided, however
Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company for damages caused by its default. If other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Notes of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Company may postpone the Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.
The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(j), 7(k) and 7(l), shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement.
Termination.
If the Company shall fail to tender the Notes for delivery to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Notes, and upon demand the Company shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representatives. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.

Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.
Acts of Holders.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing. If Securities of a series are issuable as Bearer Securities, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of such series may, alternatively, be embodied in and evidenced by the record of Holders of Securities of such series voting in favor thereof, either in person or by proxies duly appointed in writing, at any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article Thirteen, or a combination of such instruments and any such record. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or ins truments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee for the appropriate series of Securities and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments or so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee for the appropriate series of Securities and the Company and any agent of such Trustee or the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of Holders of Securities shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 1306.
The Company may at its discretion set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders of Registered Securities entitled to vote or consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted under this Indenture, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If not set by the Company prior to the first solicitation of Holders of Registered Securities of a particular series made by any Person in respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such vote or consent. Upon the fixing of such a record date, those persons who were Holders of Registered Securities at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those persons, shall be entitled with respect to such Registered Securities to take such action by vote or consent or to revoke any vote or consent previously given, whether or not such persons continue to be Holders after such record date.
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership, or an official of a public or governmental body, on behalf of such corporation, association, partnership or public or governmental body or by a fiduciary, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee for the appropriate series of Securities deems reasonably sufficient.
The principal amount and serial numbers of Registered Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.
The principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, may be proved by the production of such Bearer Securities or by a certificate executed, as depositary, by any trust company, bank, banker or other depositary, wherever situated, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee for such Securities to be satisfactory, showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the Bearer Securities therein described; or such facts may be proved by the certificate or affidavit of the Person holding such Bearer Securities, if such certificate or affidavit is deemed by such Trustee to be satisfactory. The Trustee for such Securities and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (1) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, (2) such Bearer Security is produced to such Trustee by some o ther Person, (3) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or (4) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding. The principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Company and the Trustee for such Securities deem sufficient.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee for such Securities, the Security Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
Notices, Etc., to Trustee and the Company.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other documents provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
the Trustee for a series of Securities by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with such Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration Re: Humana Inc., or if sent by facsimile transmission, to a facsimile number provided by the Trustee, with a copy mailed, first class postage prepaid to the Trustee addressed to it as provided above, or
the Company by such Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (except as provided in paragraph (3) of Section 501) if furnished in writing and mailed, first class postage prepaid, addressed in the case of the Company to it, to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer, at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address previously furnished in writing to such Trustee by the Company, or if sent by facsimile transmission, to a facsimile number provided to the Trustee by the Company, with a copy mailed, first class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to it as provided above.
Notice to Holders; Waiver.
Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, (1) such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) to Holders of Registered Securities if in writing and mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice; and (2) such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) to Holders of Bearer Securities if published in (a) an Authorized Newspaper on a Business Day or (b) an electronic medium easily accessible by the Holders as may be specified by the Company to such Holders, such publication to be not earlier than the earliest date, and not later than the latest date, prescribed herein for the giving of such notice. Any such notice by publication shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if publis hed more than once, on the date of the first publication.
In any case where notice to Holders of Registered Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Registered Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities given as provided herein. Any notice mailed in the manner prescribed by this Indenture shall be conclusively deemed to have been given whether or not received by any particular Holder. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders of Registered Securities by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the reasonable approval of the Trustee for such Securities shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.
In case by reason of the suspension of any Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be made with the reasonable approval of the Trustee for such Securities shall constitute sufficient notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither the failure to give notice by publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Registered Securities given as provided herein.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee for such Securities, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.
If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by any of Sections 310 through 317, inclusive, of the Trust Indenture Act through the operation of Section 318(c) thereof, such imposed duties shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or excluded, as the case may be.

Whenever any action or Act is to be taken hereunder by the Holders of Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit, then for purposes of determining the principal amount of Securities held by such Holders, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit shall be deemed to be that amount of Dollars that could be obtained for such principal amount on the basis of a spot rate of exchange specified to the Trustee for such series in an Officers' Certificate for such Foreign Currency or currency unit into Dollars as of the date the taking of such action or Act by the Holders of the requisite percentage in principal amount of the Securities is evidenced to such Trustee.

Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
The Securities and any related coupons shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, or its President, Chief Executive Officer or one of its Vice Presidents. The Securities shall be so executed under the corporate seal of the Company reproduced thereon and attested to by its Secretary or any one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
Securities and coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series together with any coupons appertaining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for the Securities of such series for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and such Trustee, in accordance with the Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; , that, during the "restricted period" (as defined in Section 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(7) of the United States Treasury Regulations), no Bearer Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States; and , that a Bearer Security may be delivered outside the United States in connection with its original issuance only if the Person entitled to receive such Bearer Security shall have furnished to the Trustee for the Securities of such series a certificate substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A to this Indenture. If any Security shall be represented by a permanent Global Security, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 304, the notation of a beneficial owner's interest therein upon original issuance of such Security or upon exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Security shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with the original issuance of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent Global Security. Except as permitted by Section 306 or 307, the Trustee for the Securities of a series shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all appurtenant coupons for interest then matured other than matured coupons in default have been detached and cancelled. If all the Securities of any one series are not to be issued at one time and if a Board Resolution relating to such Securities shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Securities, including, without limitation, procedures with respect to interest rate, Stated Maturity, date of issuance and date from which interest, if any, shall accrue.
provided, however
provided, further
Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to Sections 102 and 301 at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication, and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, each Bearer Security shall be dated as of the date of original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
No Security or coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein manually executed by the Trustee for such Security or on its behalf pursuant to Section 614, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent for such series then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such Trustee, or any successor Authenticating Agent, as the case may be, may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee or successor Authenticating Agent had itself authenticated such Securities.
Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 301 for a Global Security in registered form must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders.
Temporary Securities and Exchange of Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any particular series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall authenticate and deliver, in the manner specified in Section 303, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, photocopied or otherwise produced, in any denomination, with like terms and conditions as the definitive Securities of like series in lieu of which they are issued in registered form or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or more coupons or without coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Any such temporary Securities may be in global form, representing such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein.
Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged only in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs or as otherwise provided in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or a Supplemental Indenture), if temporary Securities of any particular series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of such definitive Securities, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and provisions upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series, together with all unmatured coupons and matured coupons in default, if any, at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any particular series, the Company shall execute and (in accordance with a Company Order delivered at or prior to the authentication of the first definitive Security of such series) the Trustee for the Securities of such series or the Global Exchange Agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations of the same series and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and provisions; , unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and , that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 303. Until exchanged as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and with like terms and conditions, except as to payment of interest, if any, authenticated and delivered hereunder.
provided, however
provided, further
Any temporary Global Security and any permanent Global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to a Depositary designated pursuant to Section 301.
Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date specified in or determined pursuant to the terms of any such temporary Global Security (the "Exchange Date"), the Securities represented by any temporary Global Security of a series of Securities issuable in bearer form may be exchanged for definitive Securities (subject to the second succeeding paragraph) or Securities to be represented thereafter by one or more permanent Global Securities, without interest coupons. On or after the Exchange Date such temporary Global Security shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee for such Security, as the Company's agent for such purpose, or the agent appointed by the Company pursuant to Section 301 to effect the exchange of the temporary Global Security for definitive Securities (the "Global Exchange Agent"), and following such surrender, such Trustee or the Global Exchange Agent (as authorized by the Trustee as an Authenticating Agent pursuant to Section 614) shall (1) endorse the tempor ary Global Security to reflect the reduction of its principal amount by an equal aggregate principal amount of such Security, (2) endorse the applicable permanent Global Security, if any, to reflect the initial amount, or an increase in the amount of Securities represented thereby, (3) manually authenticate such definitive Securities or such permanent Global Security, as the case may be, (4) subject to Section 303, deliver such definitive Securities to the Holder thereof or, as the case may be, deliver such permanent Global Security to the Depositary to be held outside the United States for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, for credit to the respective accounts at Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, designated by or on behalf of the beneficial owners of such Securities (or to such other accounts as they may direct) and (5) redeliver such temporary Global Security to the Depositary, unless such temporary Global Security shall have been cancelled in accordance with Section 309 hereof; , that, unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Security, upon such presentation by the Depositary, such temporary Global Security shall be accompanied by a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euroclear as to the portion of such temporary Global Security held for its account then to be exchanged for definitive Securities or one or more permanent Global Securities, as the case may be, and a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Clearstream Banking, as to the portion of such temporary Global Security held for its account then to be exchanged for definitive Securities or one or more permanent Global Securities, as the case may be, each substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B to this Indenture. Each certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto of Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, shall be based on certificates of the account holders listed in the records of Euroclear or Clearst ream Banking, as the case may be, as being entitled to all or any portion of the applicable temporary Global Security. An account holder of Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, desiring to effect the exchange of interest in a temporary Global Security for an interest in definitive Securities or one or more permanent Global Securities shall instruct Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, to request such exchange on its behalf and shall deliver to Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto and dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Exchange Date. Until so exchanged, temporary Global Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities and permanent Global Securities of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder, except as provided in the fourth succeeding paragraph.
provid ed, however
The delivery to the Trustee for the Securities of the appropriate series or the Global Exchange Agent by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking of any certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto may be relied upon by the Company and such Trustee or the Global Exchange Agent as conclusive evidence that a corresponding certificate or certificates has or have been delivered to Euroclear or to Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
On or prior to the Exchange Date, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for the Securities of the appropriate series or the Global Exchange Agent definitive Securities or one or more permanent Global Securities in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary Global Security, executed by the Company in the case of the Securities. At any time, on or after the Exchange Date, upon 30 days' notice to the Trustee for the Securities of the appropriate series or the Global Exchange Agent by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, acting at the request of or on behalf of the beneficial owner, a Security represented by a temporary Global Security or a permanent Global Security, as the case may be, may be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge and such Trustee or the Global Exchange Agent shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary Global Security or such permanent Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and with like terms and provisions as the portion of such temporary Global Security or such permanent Global Security to be exchanged, which, unless the Securities of the series are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, as contemplated by Section 301, shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof; , that definitive Bearer Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a portion of the temporary Global Security or the permanent Global Security only in compliance with the requirements of the second preceding paragraph. On or prior to the thirtieth day following receipt by the Trustee for the Securities of the appropriate series or the Global Exchange Agent of such notice with respect to a Security, or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succe eding Business Day, the temporary Global Security or the permanent Global Security, as the case may be, shall be surrendered by the Depositary to such Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, or the Global Exchange Agent to be exchanged in whole, or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge following such surrender, upon the request of Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, and such Trustee or the Global Exchange Agent shall (1) endorse the applicable temporary Global Security or the permanent Global Security to reflect the reduction of its principal amount by the aggregate principal amount of such Security, (2) in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Trustee cause the terms of such Security and coupons, if any, to be entered on a definitive Security, (3) manually authenticate such definitive Security and (4) if a Bearer Security is to be delivered, deliver such definitive Security outside the United States to Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, for or on behalf of the beneficial owner thereof, in exchange for a portion of such permanent Global Security.
provided, however
Unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Security or permanent Global Security, any such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary Global Security or permanent Global Security, except that a Person receiving definitive Securities must bear the cost of any taxes, insurance, postage, transportation and the like in the event that such Person does not take delivery of such definitive Securities in person at the offices of Euroclear or Clearstream Banking. Definitive Securities in bearer form to be delivered in exchange for any portion of a temporary Global Security or a permanent Global Security shall be delivered only outside the United States.
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, any temporary Global Security or permanent Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and with like terms and conditions, except as to payment of interest, if any, authenticated and delivered hereunder. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest payable on such temporary Global Security on an Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series shall be payable to Euroclear and Clearstream Banking on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euroclear and Clearstream Banking to the Trustee for the Securities of the appropriate series or the Global Exchange Agent in the case of payment of interest on a temporary Global Security with respect to an Interest Payment Date occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date of a certificate or certificates substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit C to this Indenture, for credit without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such Global Security on such Interest Payment Date and who have, in the case of payment of interest on a temporary Global Security with respect to an Interest Payment Date occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date, each delivered to Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, a certificate substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit D to this Indenture.
Any definitive Bearer Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee for the Securities of the appropriate series or the Global Exchange Agent in exchange for a portion of a temporary Global Security or a permanent Global Security shall not bear a coupon for any interest which shall theretofore have been duly paid by such Trustee to Euroclear or Clearstream Banking or by the Company to such Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 304.
With respect to Exhibits A, B, C and D to this Indenture, the Company may, in its discretion and if required or desirable under applicable law, substitute one or more other forms of such exhibits for such exhibits, eliminate the requirement that any or all certificates be provided, or change the time that any certificate may be required, that such substitute form or forms or notice of elimination or change of such certification requirement have theretofore been delivered to the Trustee with a Company Request and such form or forms, elimination or change is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee for the Securities of each series a register (the register maintained in such office being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and of transfers of Registered Securities. The Trustee for the Securities of each series is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers of Registered Securities of such series as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any particular series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for the Securities of each series shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of any authorized denominations, and of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal amount and with like terms and conditions.
Except as set forth below, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any particular series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of any authorized denominations, and of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal amount and with like terms and conditions upon surrender of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, Registered Securities may not be exchanged for Bearer Securities.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section or Section 304, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Registered Securities in definitive form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Registered Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If (but not only if) permitted by the applicable Board Resolution and (subject to Section 308) set forth in the applicable Officer's Certificate, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and with like terms and provisions upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, with all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured coupon or coupons or matured coupon or coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company (or to the Trustee for the Security in case of matured coupons in default) in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing coupon or coupons, or the surrender of such m issing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and such Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; , that, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, interest represented by coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons at an office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and with like terms and conditions after the close of business at such office or agency on or after (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be (or, if such coupon is so surrendered with such Bearer Security, such coupon shall be returned to the person so surrendering the Bearer Security), and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
provided, however
Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
If at any time the Depositary for Securities of a series in registered form notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 303, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities for such series. If (i) a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee for Securities of such series in registered form a Company Order stating that the Securities of such series shall be exchangeable, or (iii) an Event of Default under Section 501 hereof has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of such series, the Company's election pursuant to Section 301 shall no longer be effective with respect to the Securities for such series and the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Registered Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Registered Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Registered Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities in registered form, the Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series of like tenor and terms and in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and, upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of like tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security of like tenor and terms and in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Glob al Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Securities in definitive form representing the aggregate principal amount of such Global Security, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Registered Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee in writing. The Trustee shall deliver such Registered Securities to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee for such Security) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar for such series duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 1104 and ending at the close of business on (A) if Securities of the series are issuable only as Registered Securities, the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption and (B) if Securities of the series are issuable as Bearer Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant notice of redemption or, if Securities of the series are also issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption as a whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for re demption except that such a Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that series and like tenor; , that such Registered Security shall be simultaneously surrendered for redemption.
provided, however
Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 305, the Company will not be required to exchange any Securities if, as a result of the exchange, the Company would suffer adverse consequences under any United States law or regulation.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities and Coupons.
If (i) any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon appertaining thereto is surrendered to the Trustee for such Security or the Company and the Trustee for a Security receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or coupon and (ii) there is delivered to the Company and such Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or such Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired by a bona fide or protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request such Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for such mutilated Security, or in exchange for the Security to which a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen) a new Security of the same series and in a like principal amount and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or coupon (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security or coupon) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee for such Security such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and such Trustee and any agent of any of them of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof; , that the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, any interest on Bearer Securi ties shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto.
provided, however
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including all fees and expenses of the Trustee for such Security) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series, with its coupons, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for any mutilated Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and each such new Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and each such new Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series and their coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
Interest on any Registered Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall, if so provided in such Security, be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest payment.
Unless otherwise provided with respect to the Securities of any series, payment of interest may be made at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company (i) in the case of Registered Securities, may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register, or (ii) in the case of Bearer Securities, upon presentation and surrender of the appropriate coupon appertaining thereto or by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Securities of any series in definitive form, whether having identical or different terms and provisions, having the same Interest Payment Dates will, at the option of the Company, be entitled to receive interest payments, other than at Maturity, by wire transfer of immediately available funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee for the Securities of such series at least 15 days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date. Any wire instructions received by the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall remain in effect until revoked by the Holder.
Unless otherwise provided or contemplated by Section 301, every permanent Global Security will provide that interest, if any, payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to each of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking with respect to that portion of such permanent Global Security held for its account by the Depositary. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will in such circumstances credit the interest received by it in respect of such permanent Global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.
Any interest on any Registered Security of any particular series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of that series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee for the Registered Securities of such series in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Security of that series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with such Trustee an amount of money in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Sections 311(b) and 311(d)), equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to such Truste e for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon such Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall not be more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by such Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. Such Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities of that series at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Spe cial Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of that series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Registered Securities of any particular series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Registered Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice is given by the Company to the Trustee for the Securities of such series of the proposed manner of payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by such Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Persons Deemed Owners.
Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee for such Security and any agent of the Company or such Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 307) interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and none of the Company, such Trustee or any agent of the Company or such Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Title to any Bearer Security and any coupons appertaining thereto shall pass by delivery. The Company, the Trustee for such Security and any agent of the Company or such Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any coupon as the absolute owner of such Bearer Security or coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security or coupon be overdue, and none of the Company, such Trustee or any agent of the Company or such Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Cancellation.
All Securities and coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund payment, shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee for such Securities, be delivered to such Trustee and, in the case of Registered Securities and matured coupons, shall be promptly cancelled by it. All Bearer Securities and unmatured coupons so delivered to the Trustee for such Securities shall be cancelled by such Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for Securities of a series for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by such Trustee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture to the contrary, in the case of a series, all the Securities of which are not to be originally issued at one time, a Security of such series shall not be deemed to have been Outstanding at any time hereunder if and to the extent that, subsequent to the authentication and delivery thereof, such Security is delivered to the Trustee for such Security for cancellation by the Company or any agent thereof upon the failure of the original purchaser thereof to make payment therefor against delivery thereof, and any Security so delivered to such Trustee shall be promptly cancelled by it. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee for such Securities shall be disposed of by such Trustee in accordance with its standard procedures and a certificate of disposition evidencing such disposition of Securities and coupons shall be provided to the Company by such Trustee. In the case of any temporary Global Security, which shall be disposed of if the entire aggregate principal amount of the Securities represente d thereby has been exchanged, the certificate of disposition shall state that all certificates required pursuant to Section 304 hereof, substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (or in the form of any substitute exhibit as provided in the last paragraph of Section 304), to be given by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, have been duly presented to the Trustee for such Securities by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as the case may be. Permanent Global Securities shall not be disposed of until exchanged in full for definitive Securities or until payment thereon is made in full.
Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any particular series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Currency and Manner of Payments in Respect of Securities.
Unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, the following provisions shall apply:
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d) below, the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on Securities of any series denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit will be payable by the Company in Dollars based on the equivalent of that Foreign Currency or currency unit converted into Dollars in the manner described in paragraph (c) below.
It may be provided pursuant to Section 301 with respect to Registered Securities of any series denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit that Holders shall have the option, subject to paragraph (d) below, to receive payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Registered Securities in such Foreign Currency or currency unit by delivering to the Trustee (or to any duly appointed Paying Agent) for the Registered Securities of that series a written election, to be in form and substance satisfactory to such Trustee (or to any such Paying Agent), not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the applicable payment date.

provided, however
provided, however,
With respect to any Registered Securities of any series denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit and payable in Dollars, the amount of Dollars so payable will be determined by the Currency Determination Agent based on the highest indicative quotation in The City of New York selected by the Currency Determination Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date. Such selection shall be made from among the quotations appearing on the bank composite or multi-contributor pages of the Reuters Monitor Foreign Exchange Service or, if not available, the Telerate Monitor Foreign Exchange Service, for three (or two if three are not available) major banks in New York City. The first three (or two) such banks selected by the Currency Determination Agent which are offering quotes on the Reuters Foreign Exchange Service shall be used. If such quotations are unavailable from either such foreign exchange service, such selection shall be mad e from the quotations received by the Currency Determination Agent from no more than three nor less than two recognized foreign exchange dealers in The City of New York selected by the Currency Determination Agent and approved by the Company (one of which may be the Currency Determination Agent) for the purchase by the quoting dealer, for settlement on such payment date, of the aggregate amount of the Foreign Currency or currency unit payable on such payment date in respect of all Registered Securities denominated in such Foreign Currency or currency unit and for which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If fewer than two such bid quotations are available at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date, such payment will be based on the Market Exchange Rate as of the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date. If the Market Exchange Rate for such date is not then available, payments shall be made in the Foreign Currency or cu rrency unit. All currency exchange costs associated with any payment in Dollars on any such Registered Securities will be borne by the Holder thereof by deductions from such payment.
If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign Currency or currency unit in which Registered Securities of any series are payable, then with respect to each date for the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Registered Securities of that series occurring after the last date on which such Foreign Currency or currency unit was used, the Company may make such payment in Dollars. The Dollar amount to be paid by the Company to the Trustee for the Registered Securities of such series and by such Trustee or any Paying Agent for the Registered Securities of such series to the Holders of such Registered Securities with respect to such payment date shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate as of the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate, or as otherwise established pursuant to Section 3 01 with respect to such Notes. Any payment in respect of such Registered Security made under such circumstances in Dollars will not constitute an Event of Default hereunder.
For purposes of this Indenture the following terms shall have the following meanings:
A "Component Currency" shall mean any currency which is a component currency of any currency unit.
"Election Date" shall mean, for the Registered Securities of any series, the date specified pursuant to Section 301(14).
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 311, the following shall apply: (i) if the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the number of units of that currency as a component shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion, (ii) if two or more Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the amounts of those currencies as components shall be replaced by an amount in such single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such a single currency, (iii) if any Component Currency is divided into two or more currencies, the amount of that original Component Currency as a component shall be replaced by the amounts of such two or more currencies having an aggregate value on the date of division equal to the amount of the former Component Currency immediately before such division and (iv) in the event of an official redenomination of any currency (including, without limitation, a currency unit), the obligations of the Company to make payments in or with reference to such currency on the Registered Securities of any series shall, in all cases, be deemed immediately following such redenomination to be obligations to make payments in or with reference to that amount of redenominated currency representing the amount of such currency immediately before such redenomination.
All determinations referred to in this Section 311 made by the Currency Determination Agent shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Holders of the applicable Securities. The Currency Determination Agent shall promptly give written notice to the Trustee of any such decision or determination. The Currency Determination Agent shall have no liability for any determinations referred to in this Section 311 made by it.
The Trustee for the Securities of a particular series shall be fully justified and protected in relying and acting upon information received by it from the Company and the Currency Determination Agent with respect to any of the matters addressed in or contemplated by this Section 311 and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine such information independently.
Appointment and Resignation of Currency Determination Agent.
If and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a currency unit or a currency other than Dollars or (ii) may be payable in a currency unit or a currency other than Dollars, or so long as it is required under any other provision of this Indenture, then the Company shall maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required, a Currency Determination Agent. The Company shall cause the Currency Determination Agent to make the necessary foreign exchange determinations at the time and in the manner specified pursuant to Section 301 for the purpose of determining the applicable rate of exchange and for the purpose of converting the issued currency or currency unit into the applicable payment currency or currency unit for the payment of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, pursuant to Section 311.
No resignation of the Currency Determination Agent and no appointment of a successor Currency Determination Agent pursuant to this Section shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Currency Determination Agent as evidenced by a written instrument delivered to the Company and the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities accepting such appointment executed by the successor Currency Determination Agent.
If the Currency Determination Agent shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Currency Determination Agent for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Currency Determination Agent or Currency Determination Agents with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Currency Determination Agent may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall only be one Currency Determination Agent with respect to the Securities of any particular series).
Ranking.
The Securities shall constitute the senior indebtedness of the Company and shall rank in right of payment among themselves and with all of the other existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company.

Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 401 of the option applicable to this Section 402, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all Outstanding Securities of the particular series and any coupons appertaining thereto on the date the conditions set forth below in Section 404 are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged all the obligations relating to the Outstanding Securities of that series and the Securities of that series, including any coupons appertaining thereto, shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 406, Section 408 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to below in this Section 402, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture and cured all then existing Events of Default (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of Outstanding Securities of the particular series and coupons, if any, of such series to receive payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities when such payments are due or on the Redemption Date solely out of the trust created pursuant to this Indenture; (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities concerning issuing temporary Securities of that series, or, where relevant, registration of such Securities, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities of that series and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for Securities payments held in trust; (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee for the Securities of that series, and the Company's obligations in connection the rewith; and (d) this Article Four and the obligations set forth in Section 406 hereof.

Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 401 of the option applicable to this Section 403, the Company shall be released from any obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 704 and 801 hereof (and any other covenant in addition to those set forth herein applicable to Securities of any series pursuant to Section 301 hereof specified to be released as provided under this Section 403) with respect to the Outstanding Securities of the particular series, along with any additional covenants contained in such Security or any Supplemental Indenture in connection therewith, on and after the date the conditions set forth below in Section 404 are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Securities of that series and any coupons appertaining thereto shall thereafter be deemed not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outsta nding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of that series and any coupons appertaining thereto, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or Event of Default under subsection 501(3) but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of that series shall be unaffected thereby.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any particular series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee for the Securities of such series may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of that series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relating to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of any series or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee for the Securities of such series (irrespective of whether the principal (or, if the Securities of such series are (i) OID Securities or (ii) Indexed Securities, such amount as may be due and payable with respect to such Securities pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 502) of any Security of such series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether such Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (or, if the Securities of such series are (i) OID Securities or (ii) Indexed Securities, such amount as may be due and payable with respect to such Securities pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 502) (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of such series and any related coupons and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of such Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607) and of the Holders of the Securities of such series and any related coupons allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities and coupons to make such payments to such Trustee, and in the event that such Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities and coupons, to pay to such Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due such Trustee under Section 607.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee for the Securities of any series to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security or coupon any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of such series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee for the Securities or coupons of any series to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other person performing similar functions.
Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities or Coupons.
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities or coupons of any series may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee for the Securities of any series without the possession of any of the Securities or coupons of such series or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by such Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities and coupons of such series in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
Application of Money Collected.
Any money collected by the Trustee for the Securities of any series pursuant to this Article with respect to the Securities or coupons of such series shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by such Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, upon presentation of the Securities or coupons of such series, or both, as the case may be, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
First: To the payment of all amounts due such Trustee under Section 607;
Second: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon the Securities and coupons of such series for principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities and coupons for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, respectively; and
Third: The balance, if any, to the Company.
Limitation on Suits.
No Holder of any Security of any particular series or any related coupons shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
an Event of Default with respect to that series shall have occurred and be continuing and such Holder shall have previously given written notice to the Trustee for the Securities of such series of such default and the continuance thereof;
the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee for the Securities of such series to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
such Holder or Holders have offered to such Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
such Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to such Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Securities of that series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities of that series, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders of Securities of that series.
Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal (and Premium, if any) and Interest, if any.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security or coupon shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 307) interest, if any, on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If the Trustee for the Securities of any series or any Holder of a Security or coupon has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to such Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, such Trustee and the Holders of Securities or coupons shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of such Trustee and such Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee for the Securities of any series or to the Holders of Securities or coupons is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
No delay or omission of the Trustee for the Securities of any series or of any Holder of any Security of such series to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to such Trustee for the Securities or coupons of any series or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by such Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
Control by Holders.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any particular series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee for the Securities of such series with respect to the Securities of that series or exercising any trust or power conferred on such Trustee with respect to such Securities, provided that:
such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture and could not involve the Trustee in personal liability; and
such Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by such Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any particular series and any related coupons may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of that series waive any past default hereunder with respect to that series and its consequences, except:
a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of that series; or
a default with respect to a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of that series affected.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Undertaking for Costs.
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security or coupon by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for the Securities or coupons of any series for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee for the Securities of any series, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any particu lar series or to any suit instituted by any Holder of any Security or coupon for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of such series or the payment of any coupon on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee for any series of Securities, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Judgment Currency.
If, for the purpose of obtaining a judgment in any court with respect to any obligation of the Company hereunder or under any Security or any related coupon, it shall become necessary to convert into any other currency or currency unit any amount in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such Security or coupon, then such conversion shall be made by the Currency Determination Agent at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date of entry of the judgment (the "Judgment Date"). If pursuant to any such judgment, conversion shall be made on a date (the "Substitute Date") other than the Judgment Date and there shall occur a change between the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date and the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Substitute Date, the Company agrees to pay such additional amounts, if any, as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid is equal to the amount in such other currency or currency unit which, when converted at the Market Exchange Rate as in e ffect on the Judgment Date, is the amount due hereunder or under such Security or coupon. Any amount due from the Company under this Section 516 shall be due as a separate debt and is not to be affected by or merged into any judgment being obtained for any other sums due hereunder or in respect of any Security or coupon. In no event, however, shall the Company be required to pay more in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such Security or coupon at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date than the amount of currency or currency unit stated to be due hereunder or under such Security or coupon so that in any event the Company's obligations hereunder or under such Security or coupon will be effectively maintained as obligations in such currency or currency unit, and the Company shall be entitled to withhold (or be reimbursed for, as the case may be) any excess of the amount actually realized upon any such conversion on the Substitute Date over the amount due and payable on the Judgment Date.
The Trustee

Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series for which the Trustee is serving as such,
such Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against such Trustee; and

In case an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

such Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee for any series of Securities to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee for any series of Securities shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
Notice of Defaults.
Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to Securities of any particular series, the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall give to Holders of Securities of that series, in the manner set forth in Section 106, notice of such default known to such Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; , that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of that series, or in the deposit of any sinking fund payment with respect to Securities of that series, such Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of such Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Securities of that series and related coupons. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" mea ns any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of that series.
provided, however

If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee for the Securities of such series within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
The Trustee for the Securities of any series may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of such series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to such Trustee and to the Company.
If at any time:

such Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
such Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of such Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of such Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
Every such successor Trustee appointed hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retir ing shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of th e Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in Subsections (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee for the Securities of any series shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
Any corporation into which the Trustee for the Securities of any series may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of such Trustee, shall be the successor of such Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent for such series then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee or Authenticating Agent, as the case may be, may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee or successor Authenticating Agent had itself authenticated such Securities.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
The Trustee is subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, excluding any creditor relationship listed in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent indicated.
Authenticating Agents.
At any time when any of the Securities of any series remain Outstanding, the Trustee for the Securities of such series may, subject to its sole discretion, appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with respect to the Securities of such series, which may include the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, with power to act on the Trustee's behalf and subject to its discretion in the authentication and delivery of Securities of such series in connection with transfers and exchanges under Sections 304, 305 and 1107 as fully to all intents and purposes as though such Authenticating Agent had been expressly authorized by those Sections of this Indenture to authenticate and deliver Securities of such series. For all purposes of this Indenture, the authentication and delivery of Securities of such series by an Authenticating Agent for such Securities pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be authentication and delivery of such Securities "by the Trustee" for the Securities of such series. Any such Aut henticating Agent shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually pursuant to law or the requirements of such supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor of such Authenticating Agent hereunder, if such successor corporation is otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the parties hereto or the Authenticating Agent or such successor corporation.
Any Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may resign at any time by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee for such series and to the Company. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company in the manner set forth in Section 105. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities shall cease to be eligible under this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent, shall give written notice of such appointment to the Company and shall give written notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its prede cessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
If an appointment with respect to one or more series of Securities is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certification of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
"This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
The Bank of New York, as Trustee
By By
As Authenticating Agent Authorized Signatory"

With respect to each particular series of Securities, the Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee for the Securities of such series,

at such other times as such Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished,
excluding from any such list names and addresses received by such Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar for the Securities of such series, if so acting.
Preservation of Information; Communications to Holders.
The Trustee for each series of Securities shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Holders of the Securities of such series contained in the most recent lists furnished to such Trustee as provided in Section 701 and the names and addresses of Holders of the Securities of such series received by such Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar for such series, if so acting. The Trustee for each series of Securities may destroy any list relating to such series of Securities furnished to it as provided in Section 701 upon receipt of a new list relating to such series so furnished.
If three or more Holders of Securities of any particular series (hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee for the Securities of any such series, and furnish to such Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Security of that series for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders of Securities of that series with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities of that series and is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then such Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, at its election, either
afford such applicants access to the information preserved at the time by such Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a), or
inform such applicants as to the approximate number of Holders of Securities of that series whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by such Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a), and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Holders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application.
If any such Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to that information, such Trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to each Holder of Securities of that series whose name and address appears in the information preserved at the time by such Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a), a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to such Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five days after such tender, such Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of such Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the Holders of Securities of that series or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, such Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Holders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise such Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.
Every Holder of Securities of each series or coupons, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee for the Securities of such series that neither the Company nor such Trustee, nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 702(b), regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under Section 702(b).

The Trustee for the Securities of each series shall also comply with Sections 313(b), 313(c) and 313(d) of the Trust Indenture Act.
At the time that the Trustee for the Securities of each series mails such a report to the Holders of Securities of such series, each such Trustee shall file a copy of that report with the Commission and with each stock exchange on which the Securities of that series are listed. The Company shall provide notice to the appropriate Trustee when the Securities of any series are listed on any stock exchange.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee, subject to Section 601 hereof, is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
Consolidation, Merger, Conveyance or Transfer

Covenants
Payment of Principal (and Premium, if any) and Interest, if any.
The Company agrees, for the benefit of each particular series of Securities, that it will duly and punctually pay in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Sections 311(b) and 311(d)) the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on that series of Securities in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such series, any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any interest due on Bearer Securities on or before Maturity shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the several coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they severally mature.

Maintenance of Office or Agency.
If Securities of a series are issuable only as Registered Securities the Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for that series an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, an office or agency where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company with respect to the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. If Securities of a series are issuable as Bearer Securities, the Company will maintain (A) an office or agency (which may be the same office or agency) in a Place of Payment for that series in the United States where any Registered Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where any Registered Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for exchange, where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Se curities of that series and this Indenture may be served and where Bearer Securities of that series and related coupons may be presented or surrendered for payment in the circumstances described in the following paragraph (and not otherwise), (B) subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, in a Place of Payment for that series which is located outside the United States, an office or agency where Securities of that series and related coupons may be presented and surrendered for payment; , that if the Securities of that series are listed on the Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange located outside the United States and such stock exchange shall so require, the Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Securities of that series in Luxembourg or any other required city located outside the United States, as the case may be, so long as the Securities of that series are listed on such exchange, and (C) subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, in a Place of Pa yment for that series located outside the United States an office or agency where any Registered Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee for the Securities of that series of the location, and any change in the location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency in respect of any series of Securities or shall fail to furnish the Trustee for the Securities of that series with the address thereof, such presentations (to the extent permitted by law), and surrenders of Securities of that series may be made and notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of such Trustee, except that Bearer Securities of that series and the related coupons may be presented and surrendered for payment at the offices specified in the Security, and the Company hereby appoints the same as its agent to receive such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
provided, however
Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301, no payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on Bearer Securities shall be made at any office or agency of the Company in the United States or by check mailed to any address in the United States or by transfer to an account maintained with a bank located in the United States. Payments will not be made in respect of Bearer Securities or coupons appertaining thereto pursuant to presentation to the Company, or its designated Paying Agents within the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on any Bearer Security denominated and payable in Dollars will be made at the office of the Company's Paying Agent in the United States, if, and only if, payment in Dollars of the full amount of such principal, premium or interest, as the case may be, at all offices or agencies outside the United States maintained for that purpose by the Company in accordance with this Indenture is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions and the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to that effect.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies (in or outside the Place of Payment) where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all of the purposes specified above in this Section and may from time to time rescind such designations; , that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for such purpose. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee for the Securities of each series so affected of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such office or agency. Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities, the Company hereby designates as a Place of Payment for each series of Securities the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, and initi ally appoints the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office as Paying Agent in such city and as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
provided, however
Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301, if and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a currency other than Dollars or (ii) may be payable in a currency other than Dollars, or so long as it is required under any other provision of the Indenture, then the Company will maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required, a Currency Determination Agent.
Money for Securities Payments To Be Held in Trust.
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any particular series of Securities and any related coupons, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Sections 311(b) and 311(d)) sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee for the Securities of such series of its action or failure so to act.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any particular series of Securities and any related coupons, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any such Securities, deposit with a Paying Agent for the Securities of such series a sum (in the currency or currency unit described in the preceding paragraph) sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee for the Securities of such series) the Company will promptly notify such Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any particular series of Securities other than the Trustee for the Securities of such series to execute and deliver to such Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with such Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
give such Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal (or premium, if any) and interest, if any, on Securities of that series; and
at any time during the continuation of any such default, upon the written request of such Trustee, forthwith pay to such Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee for the Securities of any series all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by such Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to such Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
[Intentionally Omitted]
Statements as to Compliance.
The Company will deliver to the Trustee for each series of Securities, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a written statement signed by the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer of the Company stating that:
a review of the activities of the Company during such year and of performance under this Indenture has been made under his supervision; and
to the best of his knowledge, based on such review, the Company is in compliance with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture.
For purposes of this Section, such compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided under this Indenture.
Corporate Existence.
Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; , that the Company shall not be required to preserve any right or franchise if the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer necessary or desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company.

Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, if the Company shall determine that any payment made outside the United States by the Company or any of their Paying Agents of principal or interest due in respect of any Bearer Security (an "Affected Security") of such series or any coupon appertaining thereto would, under any present or future laws or regulations of the United States, be subject to any certification, information or other reporting requirement of any kind, the effect of which requirement is the disclosure to the Company, any Paying Agent or any governmental authority of the nationality, residence or identity (as distinguished from, for example, status as a United States Alien) of a beneficial owner of such Affected Security of such series or coupon that is a United States Alien (other than such a requirement that (i) would not be applicable to a payment made by the Company, or any one of their Paying Agents (A) directly to the beneficial owner or (B) to a custodian, nominee or oth er agent of the beneficial owner, (ii) can be satisfied by such custodian, nominee or other agent certifying to the effect that such beneficial owner is a United States Alien; provided that, in each case referred to in clauses (i)(B) or (ii), payment by such custodian, nominee or other agent to such beneficial owner is not otherwise subject to any such requirement (other than a requirement which is imposed on a custodian, nominee or other agent described in item (iv) of this sentence), (iii) would not be applicable to a payment made by at least one other Paying Agent of the Company or (iv) is applicable to a payment to a custodian, nominee or other agent of the beneficial owner of such Security who is a United States person (as hereinafter defined), a controlled foreign corporation for United States tax purposes, a foreign person 50 percent or more of the gross income of which for the three-year period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding the year of payment is effectively connected with a Uni ted States trade or business, or is otherwise related to the United States), the Company shall elect by notice to the Trustee for such series of Securities either (x) to redeem the Affected Securities of such series, as a whole, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, or (y) if the conditions of the next succeeding paragraph are satisfied, to pay the additional amounts specified in such paragraph. The Company shall make such determination and election as soon as practicable and give prompt notice thereof (the "Determination Notice") in the manner described in Section 106 stating the effective date of such certification, information or reporting requirement, whether the Company has elected to redeem the Affected Securities of such series or to pay the additional amounts specified in the next succeeding paragraph, and (if applicable) the last date by which the redemption of the Affected Securities of such series must take pla ce, as provided in the next succeeding sentence. If the Company elects to redeem the Affected Securities of such series, such redemption shall take place on such date, not later than one year after the giving of the Determination Notice, as the Company shall specify by notice to such Trustee given not less than 45 nor more than 75 days before the Redemption Date. Notice of such redemption of the Affected Securities of such series shall be given to the Holders thereof not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not so redeem the Affected Securities of such series if the Company shall subsequently determine by notice to the Trustee, not less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, that subsequent payments on the Affected Securities of such series would not be subject to any such certification, information or other reporting requirement, in which case the Company shall give prompt notice of such subsequent determination in the man ner specified in Section 106 and any earlier redemption notice shall be revoked and be of no further effect. The right of the Holders of Affected Securities called for redemption to exchange such Affected Securities for Registered Securities (which Registered Securities will remain Outstanding following such redemption) will terminate on the fifteenth day prior to the Redemption Date, and no further exchanges of Affected Securities for Registered Securities shall be permitted unless the Company shall have made the subsequent determination and given the notice referred to in the preceding sentence. As used hereinabove, "United States person" means any citizen or resident of the United States, any corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States and any estate or trust the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source.
If and so long as the certification, information or other reporting requirement referred to in the preceding paragraph would be fully satisfied by payment of a withholding tax, backup withholding tax or similar charge, the Company may elect by notice to the Trustee to pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every net payment made outside the United States following the effective date of such requirement by the Company or any of their Paying Agents of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, due in respect of any Affected Security of such series or any coupon appertaining thereto to a Holder who certifies that the beneficial owner is a United States Alien (but without any requirement that the nationality, residence or identity of such beneficial owner be disclosed to the Company, any Paying Agent or any governmental authority), after deduction or withholding for or on account of such withholding tax, backup withholding tax or similar charge (other than a withholding tax, backup w ithholding tax or similar charge that (i) is the result of a certification, information or other reporting requirement described in the third parenthetical clause of the first sentence of the preceding paragraph or (ii) is imposed as a result of presentation of any such Affected Security or such coupon for payment more than 10 days after the date on which such payment becomes due and payable or on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurs later), will not be less than the amount provided in such Affected Security or such coupon to be then due and payable. In the event the Company elects to pay such additional amounts, (the Company's election to exercise such right to be evidenced by prompt notice to the Trustee for the Securities of the appropriate series), the Company will have the right, at its sole option, at any time, to redeem the Affected Securities of such series as a whole, but not in part, at the Redemption Price, subject to the provisions of the last four sentences of the immedi ately preceding paragraph. If the Company has made the determination described in the preceding paragraph with respect to certification, information or other reporting requirements applicable only to interest and subsequently makes a determination in the manner and of the nature referred to in such preceding paragraph with respect to such requirements applicable to principal, the Company will redeem the Affected Securities of such series in the manner and on the terms described in the preceding paragraph unless the Company elects to have the provisions of this paragraph apply rather than the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph. If in such circumstances the Affected Securities of such series are to be redeemed, the Company shall have no obligation to pay additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph with respect to principal (or premium, if any) or interest accrued and unpaid after the date of the notice of such determination indicating such redemption, but will be obligated to pay such addition al amounts with respect to interest accrued and unpaid to the date of such determination. If the Company elects to pay additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph and the condition specified in the first sentence of this paragraph should no longer be satisfied, then the Company shall promptly redeem the Affected Securities of such series in whole, but not in part, at the Redemption Price subject to the provisions of the last four sentences of the immediately preceding paragraph. If the Company elects to, or is required to, redeem the Affected Securities of such series pursuant to this paragraph, it shall publish in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 106 prompt notice thereof. If the Affected Securities of such series are to be redeemed pursuant to this paragraph, the redemption shall take place on such date, not later than one year after publication of the notice of redemption, as the Company shall specify by notice to the Trustee for such series of Securities at least 60 days prior to the Re demption Date. Any redemption payments made by the Company pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the continuing obligation of the Company to pay additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK,

By: Authorized Signatory
                                            
        This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 6.30% Senior Notes Due 2018 (the "Notes"). The Notes are one of an indefinite number of series of debt securities of the Company (the "Securities"), issued or issuable under and pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 5, 2003, between the Company and The Bank of New York (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 5, 2003 (the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of the Notes are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust In denture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. This Note is one of a series designated on the face hereof initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000. The Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the Holders, issue and sell additional Securities ranking equally with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects (except for their date of issue, issue price and the date from which interest payments thereon shall accrue) so that such additional Securities shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes.
        The terms of other series of Securities issued under the Indenture may vary with respect to interest rates or interest rate formulas, issue dates, maturity, redemption, repayment, currency of payment and otherwise as provided in the Indenture. The Indenture further provides that Securities of a single series may be issued at various times, with different maturity dates and may bear interest at different rates. All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
        This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
        If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture, with respect to the Company) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series then Outstanding may declare the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest thereon shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
ipso
facto
        This Note may be redeemed at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at the option of the Company (such date of redemption, the "Optional Redemption Date") at the Redemption Price (as defined below) together with interest accrued thereon to the Optional Redemption Date.
        The "Redemption Price" shall equal to the greater of:
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and
the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments on the Notes to be redeemed consisting of principal and interest, exclusive of interest accrued to the Optional Redemption Date, discounted to the Optional Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Yield plus 30 basis points plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.
        The Notes called for redemption become due on the Optional Redemption Date. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Optional Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Notes will state the amount to be redeemed. On and after the Optional Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on any Notes that are redeemed. If less than all the Notes are redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes on a pro rata basis or by any other method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
        For purposes of determining the Redemption Price, the following definitions are applicable:
        "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining terms of the Notes.
        "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date:
the average of the bid and the asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, at 4:00 p.m. on the third business day preceding that Optional Redemption Date, as set forth on "Telerate Page 500," or such other page as may replace Telerate Page 500; or
if Telerate Page 500, or any successor page, is not displayed or does not contain bid and/or asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue at that time, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Company for that Optional Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or, if the Company is unable to obtain at least four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Company.
        "Independent Investment Banker" means either J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or Banc of America Securities LLC, as selected by the Company or, if both such firms are unwilling or unable to select the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
        "Reference Treasury Dealer" means J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC and their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City selected by the Independent Investment Banker (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"); provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
        "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Optional Redemption Date for the Notes, an average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue for the Notes, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Trustee by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Optional Redemption Date.
        "Treasury Yield" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity, computed as of the third business day immediately preceding the Optional Redemption Date, of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, equal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for the Optional Redemption Date.
        The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series issued under the Indenture to be affected thereby, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of such series; that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or interest thereon, if any, or any premium payable upon redemption thereof; or (ii) change the Place of Payment on any Security or the currency or currency unit in which any Security or the principal or i nterest thereon is payable; (iii) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof; (iv) reduce or alter the method of computation of any amount payable upon redemption, repayment or purchase of any Securities by the Company (or the time when such redemption, repayment or purchase may be made); or (v) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of that series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series, except a default in the payment of principal of or int erest, if any, on any Security of that series or a default with respect to a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be amended without the consent of such Holder.
provided, however,
        The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. The Notes shall be initially issued in the form of a Global Security. All payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Notes will be made to the Trustee so long as the Notes are in the form of a Global Security. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. If (x) the Depositary is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company delivers to the Trustee a Company Order to the effect that this Note shall be exchangeable or (z) an Event of Default has occurred and is cont inuing with respect to the Notes, this Note shall be exchangeable for Notes in definitive form and in an equal aggregate principal amount. Such definitive Notes shall be registered in such name or names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee.
        As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein and above, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
        No reference herein to the Indenture and no provisions of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
        No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
        Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
        Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Notes, as provided in the Indenture.
        No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any), or the interest, if any, on this Note, or for any claim based thereon, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment of penalty or otherwise; and all such personal liability is expressly released and waived as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the issuance of this Note.
        The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
