LOUISVILLE, KY (August 5, 2003) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) announced today the completion of a public offering of $300 million of its 6.30 percent Senior Notes, due August 1, 2018, at 99.713 percent of the principal amount ("Senior Notes"). Humana expects to use the net proceeds of this offering as one of various options available for the funding of its short-term financing needs. J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. and Banc of America Securities, LLC acted as the joint book-running managers for the Senior Notes.
     Contemporaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the company also entered into interest-rate swap agreements ("Swaps") with major financial institutions which also mature on August 1, 2018, and have the same critical terms as the Senior Notes. The Swaps have the effect of converting the 6.30 percent fixed interest rate on the Senior Notes to a variable interest rate.
     While the issuance of the Senior Notes further strengthens the company's investment-grade capital structure and corporate liquidity over the next 15 years, the Swaps are expected to assure that the incremental net interest expense will not exceed $.01 in diluted earnings per common share over the next 12 months. The company's earnings guidance issued on July 28, 2003 includes the anticipated impact of this incremental interest expense.
