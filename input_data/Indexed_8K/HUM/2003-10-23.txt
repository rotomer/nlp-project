   LOUISVILLE, KY (October 23, 2003) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) announced today that its subsidiaries, Humana Health Plan of Ohio and Humana Insurance Company, have reached a settlement agreement involving litigation with physicians in the Greater Cincinnati area. The agreement, which is subject to approval by the courts, resolves Humana's involvement in litigation brought by the Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati, the Butler County Medical Society, the Northern Kentucky Medical Association and several physicians.
    "This settlement helps us on two fronts because it continues our long-standing practice of investing in our community's health care providers and it puts a distracting legal action behind us" said Larry D. Savage, president and CEO, Humana of Ohio. "For more than four years, we've led the industry through our investment in high quality, cost effective health care in Greater Cincinnati. This agreement allows us to continue on that path."
    The settlement agreement among the parties specifies that Humana denies any wrongdoing. The settlement agreement also specifies increases in reimbursement for the providers in the Cincinnati, Ohio and Northern Kentucky metropolitan area of approximately $20 million in 2004, an additional $15 million in 2005, and an additional $10 million in 2006. Humana does not expect this settlement to impact its previously issued consolidated earnings guidance for either 2003 or 2004 because the expected increased expenses begin in 2004 and have already been accounted for in the company's previous earnings guidance. Humana is scheduled to release its third quarter 2003 earnings results on October 27, 2003.
