     LOUISVILLE, KY (October 27, 2003) -- Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported earnings per diluted share of $.38 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 ("3Q03") compared to $.31 in earnings per diluted share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2002 ("3Q02"), an increase of 23 percent.
     Net income of $62,119,000 for 3Q03 increased 19 percent over the prior year, up from $52,331,000 in 3Q02. Pretax margin of 3.0 percent for 3Q03 increased 30 basis points from the 3Q02 pretax margin of 2.7 percent.
     The increase in year-over-year results for 3Q03 was driven by the improvement in the company's Commercial segment.
     Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 ("the 2003 period") also improved over those for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 ("the 2002 period"). Earnings per diluted share for the 2003 period of $1.01 increased 17 percent compared to $.86 for the 2002 period. Net income of $162,625,000 increased 13 percent for the 2003 period versus $144,460,000 in the 2002 period. The company's pretax margin of 2.7 percent in the 2003 period increased 20 basis points over that for the 2002 period of 2.5 percent.
     Results for the 2003 period include the writedown of building and equipment of $17,233,000 pretax ($10,529,000 net of income tax benefit or $.07 per diluted share), gain on the sale of a venture capital investment of $15,200,000 pretax ($10,108,000 net of income taxes or $.06 per diluted share), and software abandonment charges of $13,527,000 pretax ($8,265,000 net of income tax benefit or $.05 per diluted share). Each of these items was recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2003. The net impact of these items reduced pretax income for the 2003 period by $15,560,000 ($8,686,000 net of income taxes or $.05 per diluted share).
     "We were pleased with the significant growth in profitability of our commercial segment in the third quarter, as well as our successful bid on the government side for the new TRICARE South region contract," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "The government segment continues to provide a solid base of earnings as we expand our commercial segment's revenues, income and membership."
 
     
Segment Results
     Commercial segment pretax income increased to $25,952,000 in 3Q03 from $4,540,000 in 3Q02. Commercial segment pretax margin of 1.5 percent in 3Q03 was 120 basis points higher than the related pretax margin of 0.3 percent in 3Q02. The improvement in year-over-year Commercial segment results during 3Q03 was driven by a 60 basis point decline in the medical expense ratio, coupled with gains in administrative efficiencies.
     For the 2003 period, Commercial segment pretax income increased to $106,948,000 versus $45,528,000 in the 2002 period. Pretax margin for the 2003 period in the Commercial segment was 2.1 percent, a 110 basis point increase from 1.0 percent in the 2002 period.
     Commercial segment pretax results for the 2003 period include software abandonment charges of $13,527,000, gain on the sale of a venture capital investment of $12,423,000 and the writedown of building and equipment of $4,325,000. Each of these items was recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2003.
     Government segment pretax income of $67,460,000 in 3Q03 compares to 3Q02 Government segment pretax income of $72,417,000. Pretax margin for the Government segment decreased 70 basis points to 4.8 percent in 3Q03 compared to 5.5 percent in 3Q02. The decline in year-over-year Government segment results during 3Q03 was primarily driven by an increase in the TRICARE medical expense ratio, partially offset by improvement in the medical expense ratio for the Medicare+Choice business.
     Government segment pretax income for the 2003 period decreased to $138,056,000 from $166,913,000 in the 2002 period. Government segment pretax margin was 3.4 percent during the 2003 period versus 4.2 percent in the 2002 period.
     Government segment pretax results for the 2003 period include the writedown of building and equipment of $12,908,000 and gain on the sale of a venture capital investment of $2,777,000. Each of these items was recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2003.

     TRICARE's insured membership totaled 1,746,300 at September 30, 2003, versus comparable membership at September 30, 2002 of 1,755,700. TRICARE ASO membership was 1,057,000 at September 30, 2003, up 2 percent from September 30, 2002 membership of 1,038,400. TRICARE premium revenues and administrative services fees increased year-over-year by approximately 18 percent during 3Q03 due to a change in the monthly base revenue effective in July 2003.
     Medicaid membership of 460,800 at September 30, 2003 declined by approximately 9 percent from September 30, 2002. Approximately 84 percent of the company's Medicaid membership is in Puerto Rico. Per member premiums for the Medicaid business, net of benefit changes, increased in the range of 8 to 10 percent during 3Q03 versus 3Q02.
     Government segment premiums and administrative services fees for the 2003 period were $3,986,866,000 versus $3,922,719,000 in the 2002 period, an increase of 2 percent.
 
     
Medical and SG&A Expenses
     The company's 3Q03 medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premiums) of 83.8 percent increased 20 basis points compared to the 3Q02 medical expense ratio of 83.6 percent.
     For the 2003 period, the medical expense ratio was 83.7 percent, unchanged from that for the 2002 period.
     The selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) for 3Q03 of 14.9 percent decreased by 30 basis points from the 3Q02 SG&A ratio of 15.2 percent.
     For the 2003 period, the SG&A expense ratio was 15.3 percent compared to 15.4 percent in the 2002 period. SG&A expenses for the 2003 period include the writedown of building and equipment of $17,233,000 recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2003. This resulted in an increase to the 2003 period SG&A ratio of 20 basis points.
 
     
Cash flows from operations
     Cash flows provided by operations for 3Q03 of $69,654,000 compared to cash flows provided by operations of $82,613,000 in 3Q02 due to normal fluctuation in working capital items. Neither quarter's cash flows from operations were impacted by the timing of the monthly receipt of the Medicare+Choice premium payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS").
     The fixed monthly Medicare+Choice premium payment from CMS is due to Humana on the first day of each month. However, if the first of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, the company receives that payment on the last business day of the prior month, often resulting in a significant impact on cash flows from operations.
     Cash flows provided by operations for the 2003 period totaled $122,920,000, inclusive of the negative impact of $205,755,000 from the timing of the receipt of the premium payment from CMS. Cash flows used in operations for the 2002 period of $101,302,000 included the negative impact of $216,628,000 related to the timing of the premium payment receipt from CMS.
 
     
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     There were no non-GAAP financial measures for 3Q03 or 3Q02. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, to certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company for the 2003 period and 2002 period.
      Management believes the difference in timing of this cash event between periods may be so significant as to distort a particular period's trend in operating cash flows. Management believes that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the relevance of a factor to normal operating results. In some cases, large factors or events may obscure short-term patterns and long-term trends. When reviewing and analyzing our cash flow position, management apportions the appropriate CMS premium payment in each month. To do otherwise would distort a meaningful analysis of our cash flow. Decisions such as management's forecast or business plans regarding cash flow, therefore, use this non-GAAP financial measure.

However, during 3Q03 the company repurchased 1,412,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $23,127,000, an average price of $16.38 per share in connection with employee stock plans.
