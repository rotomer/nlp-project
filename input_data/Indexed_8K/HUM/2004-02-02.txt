    LOUISVILLE, KY (February 2, 2004) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported earnings per diluted share of $.41 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003 ("4Q03") compared to a $.01 loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002 ("4Q02"). Net income of $66,309,000 for 4Q03 compares favorably to a net loss of $1,705,000 in 4Q02. Pretax margin of 3.2 percent for 4Q03 increased 330 basis points from the loss in 4Q02.
    The increase in year-over-year results for 4Q03 was driven by a significant improvement in operating earnings for the company's Commercial segment, growth in its Government segment operating earnings and the absence of unusual items and charges incurred in 4Q02.
    Results for the year ended December 31, 2003 ("FY2003") also improved over those for the year ended December 31, 2002 ("FY2002"). Earnings per diluted share for FY2003 of $1.41 increased 66 percent compared to $.85 for FY2002. Net income of $228,934,000 increased 60 percent for FY2003 versus $142,755,000 in FY2002. The company's pretax margin of 2.8 percent in FY2003 increased 90 basis points over that for FY2002 of 1.9 percent.
    "We are pleased that our results for 2003 show meaningful progress in each of our business segments, the result of our sustained commitment to a diversified customer base," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "The growth in our Commercial segment results, with an ever-increasing interest in our innovative Smart products, positions us firmly as a leader in health benefits solutions for both employers and employees. In August 2003, the Department of Defense recognized Humana's leadership and dedication to customer service by awarding us the TRICARE South Region contract. In addition, with the Medicare Modernization Act, we anticipate exploring new opportunities to extend our long-term and successful relationship with our nation's seniors."
    Results for FY2003 included:
the writedown of building and equipment of $17,233,000 pretax ($10,529,000 net of income tax benefit, or $.07 per diluted share),
a gain on the sale of a venture capital investment of $15,200,000 pretax ($10,108,000 net of income taxes, or $.06 per diluted share), and
software abandonment charges of $13,527,000 pretax ($8,265,000 net of income tax benefit, or $.05 per diluted share).
    These items were recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2003. The net impact of these items reduced pretax income for FY2003 by $15,560,000 ($8,686,000 net of income taxes, or $.05 per diluted share).
    Results for 4Q02 and FY2002 included:
severance and related employee benefit charges of $32,105,000 pretax ($19,616,000 net of income taxes, or $.12 per diluted share),
long-lived asset impairment and lease discontinuance costs of $3,772,000 pretax ($2,305,000 net of income taxes, or $.01 per diluted share),

    The net impact of these items reduced pretax income for 4Q02 and FY2002 by $85,588,000 ($58,200,000 net of income taxes, or $.35 per diluted share).
Segment Results
    Commercial segment pretax income increased to $14,062,000 in 4Q03 from a loss of $60,702,000 in 4Q02. Commercial segment pretax margin of 0.8 percent in 4Q03 was 470 basis points higher versus the loss in 4Q02.
    The improvement in year-over-year Commercial segment results during 4Q03 was driven by incremental improvements in both the underwriting results and the percent of premiums and administrative services fees spent on selling, general and administrative expenses for the segment, as well as the absence of unusual items and charges incurred in 4Q02.
    For FY2003, Commercial segment pretax income increased to $121,010,000 versus a loss of $15,174,000 in FY2002. Pretax margin for FY2003 in the Commercial segment was 1.8 percent, a 210 basis point increase from the loss in FY2002.

a gain on the sale of a venture capital investment of $12,423,000, and
the writedown of building and equipment of $4,325,000.

    The increase in year-over-year Government segment results during 4Q03 was primarily driven by improvements in the operating performance of each of the company's governmental lines of business and the absence of unusual items and special charges incurred in 4Q02.
    Government segment pretax income for FY2003 decreased to $223,706,000 from $225,108,000 in FY2002. Government segment pretax margin was 4.1 percent during FY2003 versus 4.3 percent in FY2002.

    Medical membership as of December 31, 2003 totaled 6,769,600, an increase of 1.8 percent compared to the 6,647,100 medical members as of December 31, 2002.

    Commercial segment premiums and administrative services fees totaled $1,698,284,000 during 4Q03 compared to a total of $1,534,463,000 during 4Q02, or 10.7 percent higher than in the prior year.

    TRICARE's insured membership totaled 1,849,700 at December 31, 2003, versus comparable membership at December 31, 2002 of 1,755,800. TRICARE ASO membership was 1,057,200 at December 31, 2003, up 0.8 percent from December 31, 2002 membership of 1,048,700. TRICARE premium revenues and administrative services fees increased by 11.9 percent during FY2003 due primarily to a change in the monthly base revenue effective in July 2003 and additional reimbursement associated with reservist call-ups.
    Medicaid membership of 468,900 at December 31, 2003 declined by 7.3 percent from December 31, 2002 due to the carve-out of three municipalities from one of our contracts in Puerto Rico. Approximately 84 percent of the company's Medicaid membership is in Puerto Rico. Per member premiums for the Medicaid business, net of benefit changes, increased in the range of 7 to 9 percent during FY2003 versus FY2002.
 
Medical and SG&A Expenses
    The company's 4Q03 medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premiums) of 83.0 percent decreased 30 basis points compared to the 4Q02 medical expense ratio of 83.3 percent.
    For FY2003, the medical expense ratio was 83.5 percent, a 10 basis point decline from that for FY2002.
    The selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) for 4Q03 of 15.6 percent decreased by 180 basis points from the 4Q02 SG&A ratio of 17.4 percent.
    For FY2003, the SG&A expense ratio was 15.4 percent compared to 15.9 percent in FY2002.
    SG&A expenses for FY2003 included the writedown of building and equipment of $17,233,000 recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2003. This resulted in an increase to the FY2003 SG&A ratio of 10 basis points.
    SG&A expenses for FY2002 included severance and related employee benefit charges of $32,105,000, long-lived asset impairment and lease discontinuance costs of $3,772,000, and the establishment of reserves for liabilities related to previous acquisitions of $30,140,000. These items resulted in an increase to the FY2002 SG&A ratio of 60 basis points.
 
Cash Flows from Operations
    Cash flows provided by operations for 4Q03 of $290,220,000, included the positive impact of $211,899,000 from the timing of the receipt of the premium payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS").
    The fixed monthly Medicare+Choice premium payment from CMS is due to Humana on the first day of each month. However, if the first of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, the company receives that payment on the last business day of the prior month, often resulting in a significant impact on cash flows from operations.
    Cash flows provided by operations for 4Q02 of $422,710,000 included a $205,755,000 benefit from the timing of the premium payment from CMS. The year-over-year decline in the quarter's cash flows is primarily a function of the timing of the collection of TRICARE receivables during 2002.
    Cash flows provided by operations for FY2003 totaled $413,140,000 compared to cash flows provided by operations for FY2002 of $321,408,000. FY2003 cash flows from operations included a benefit of $6,144,000 from the timing of the receipt of the premium payment from CMS, while FY2002 cash flows from operations included a $10,873,000 negative impact from such timing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, to certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company for 4Q03, 4Q02, FY2003, and FY2002.
 
1 Management believes the difference in timing of this cash event between periods may be so significant as to distort a particular period's trend in operating cash flows. Management believes that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the relevance of a factor to normal operating results. In some cases, large factors or events may obscure short-term patterns and long-term trends. When reviewing and analyzing our cash flow position, management apportions the CMS premium payment in each month. To do otherwise would distort a meaningful analysis of our cash flow. Decisions such as management's forecast or business plans regarding cash flow, therefore, use this non-GAAP financial measure.
 
Parent Company Cash and Investments
    As of December 31, 2003, the parent company had $399,393,000 in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. This compares to $187,008,000 at December 31, 2002.
 
Share Repurchase Program
    During FY2003, the company acquired 3,670,500 of its common shares for an aggregate price of $44,147,000, or an average cost of $12.03 per share. 1,433,600 of these shares were purchased for $23,330,000 in connection with employee stock plans, at an average price of $16.27 per share and the remaining 2,236,900 shares were purchased in open market transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $20,817,000, or an average of $9.31 per share.
    In July 2003, the company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $100 million for the repurchase of its common shares, exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. As of January 31, 2004, substantially all of the July 2003 authorization remains available for share repurchases.
