     LOUISVILLE, KY (April 26, 2004) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported earnings per diluted share of $0.41 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004 ("1Q04") compared to $0.19 per diluted share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 ("1Q03"), an increase of 116 percent. Net income of $67,830,000 for 1Q04 increased 117 percent from net income of $31,230,000 in 1Q03. Pretax margin of 3.1 percent for 1Q04 increased 150 basis points from the 1.6 percent pretax margin in 1Q03.
     "Our results this quarter represent continued progress across a number of key operational fronts," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "We continue to expect 2004 revenue, earnings and cash flows to be the highest in Humana's history as a health benefits company."
     The increase in year-over-year results for 1Q04 was driven by improved profits in the company's Government segment accompanied by increased earnings in its Commercial segment.
Consolidated results for 1Q03 included:
The writedown of building and equipment of $17,233,000 ($10,529,000 net of income tax benefit, or $0.07 per diluted share) and
Software abandonment charges of $13,527,000 ($8,265,000 net of income tax benefit, or $0.05 per diluted share).
     The net impact of these items reduced pretax income for 1Q03 by $30,760,000 ($18,794,000 net of income tax benefit, or $0.12 per diluted share).
Segment Results
     Commercial segment pretax income increased to $39,086,000 in 1Q04 from $37,239,000 in 1Q03. Commercial segment pretax margin of 2.2 percent in 1Q04 was unchanged from 1Q03.
     Commercial segment pretax results for 1Q04 included the negative impact of an additional day of medical claims expense due to the leap year. The segment's results for 1Q03 included software abandonment charges of $13,527,000 and the writedown of building and equipment of $4,325,000. The net impact of these items reduced Commercial segment pretax income for 1Q03 by $17,852,000. Excluding these items from both 1Q04 and 1Q03, operating results for the Commercial segment in 1Q04 were essentially equivalent to those for the prior year.
     Government segment pretax income of $63,687,000 in 1Q04 compares to 1Q03 Government segment pretax income of $10,163,000. Pretax margin for the Government segment increased to 4.2 percent in 1Q04 from 0.8 percent in 1Q03, a 340 basis point increase.
     Government segment pretax results for 1Q04 included the negative impact of an additional day of medical claims expense due to the leap year, and for 1Q03 included the writedown of building and equipment of $12,908,000.
     Operating results for the Government segment increased year-over-year during 1Q04 primarily due to improved results in the company's TRICARE business unit combined with growth in MedicareAdvantage (formerly Medicare+Choice) membership.
Revenues and Membership
     Consolidated revenues for 1Q04 totaled $3,286,949,000, compared to $2,931,716,000 in 1Q03, a 12 percent increase.
     Medical membership as of March 31, 2004 totaled 7,015,000, an increase of 6 percent over the 6,625,200 medical members as of March 31, 2003.
     Commercial segment premiums and administrative services fees rose 6 percent to $1,744,787,000 in 1Q04 compared to $1,645,146,000 in 1Q03.
     Commercial segment medical membership was 3,295,600 as of March 31, 2004, an increase of 230,400 members, or 8 percent from December 31, 2003 and 292,200 members, or 10 percent from March 31, 2003. Per member premiums for the Commercial segment fully insured medical business, net of benefit changes, increased in the range of 7 to 9 percent during 1Q04 compared to 1Q03.
     Government segment premiums and administrative services fees for 1Q04 totaled $1,512,631,000, or 20 percent higher than the related 1Q03 premiums and administrative services fees of $1,258,939,000.
     MedicareAdvantage membership totaled 333,200 at March 31, 2004, an increase of 4,600 members from December 31, 2003 and an increase of 6,100 members, or 2 percent from March 31, 2003. Per member premiums for the MedicareAdvantage business, net of benefit changes, increased in the range of 8 to 10 percent during 1Q04 compared to 1Q03.
     TRICARE's insured membership totaled 1,860,100 at March 31, 2004, versus comparable membership at December 31, 2003 of 1,849,700. TRICARE ASO membership was 1,057,900 at March 31, 2004, essentially unchanged from December 31, 2003 membership of 1,057,200.
     TRICARE 1Q04 premium revenues and administrative services fees increased year over year by 37 percent due primarily to an increase in the base contract monthly revenue which became effective in July 2003.
     Medicaid membership of 468,200 at March 31, 2004 declined by 5 percent from March 31, 2003. Membership in Puerto Rico accounts for approximately 84 percent of the company's Medicaid business. Per member premiums for the Medicaid business, net of benefit changes, increased in the range of 5 to 7 percent during 1Q04 versus 1Q03.
Medical and SG&A Expenses
     The company's 1Q04 medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premiums) of 84.4 percent increased 100 basis points compared to the 1Q03 medical expense ratio of 83.4 percent.
     The selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) for 1Q04 of 14.4 percent decreased by 160 basis points from the 1Q03 SG&A ratio of 16.0 percent.
     SG&A expenses for 1Q03 included the writedown of building and equipment of $17,233,000 which resulted in an increase to the 1Q03 SG&A ratio of 60 basis points.
Cash Flows from Operations
     Cash flows used in operations for 1Q04 of $40,055,000 included the negative impact of $211,899,000 from the timing of the receipt of the premium payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). Cash flows used in operations for 1Q03 of $108,230,000 included the negative impact of $205,755,000 related to the timing of the receipt of the premium payment from CMS.
     The fixed monthly MedicareAdvantage premium payment from CMS is due to Humana on the first day of each month. However, if the first of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, the company receives that payment on the last business day of the prior month, often resulting in a significant impact on cash flows from operations.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, to certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company for 1Q04 and 1Q03.
1 Management believes the difference in timing of this cash event between periods may be so significant as to distort a particular period's trend in operating cash flows. Management believes that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the relevance of a factor to normal operating results. In some cases, large factors or events may obscure short-term patterns and long-term trends. When reviewing and analyzing our cash flow position, management apportions the CMS premium payment in each month. To do otherwise would distort a meaningful analysis of our cash flow. Decisions such as management's forecast or business plans regarding cash flow, therefore, use this non-GAAP financial measure.
Share Repurchase Program
     In July 2003, the company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $100 million for the repurchase of its common shares, exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans.
     During 1Q04, the company acquired 686,000 of its common shares for an aggregate price of $13,969,000, or an average cost of $20.36 per share. As of April 23, 2004 the company had approximately $81,300,000 remaining on its outstanding repurchase authorization.
