 Earnings guidance raised for 2004

LOUISVILLE, KY - July 26, 2004 - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.50 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004
     "The benefit of Humana's diversification among multiple lines of business is evidenced in this quarter's record results," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "The continued success we are experiencing with our traditional commercial and government products, combined with favorable results from and growing acceptance of our cutting-edge consumer strategy, are leading to record earnings for 2004."
     The increase in year-over-year consolidated results for 2Q04 was primarily driven by higher earnings in the company's Government segment. Medical cost trends were lower than previously anticipated.

The year-over-year change also includes the planned offsetting effects of a higher medical expense ratio, and a lower selling, general, and administrative expense ratio.
     Operating results for 2Q04 for the Government segment increased year over year by $25,008,000 primarily due to higher TRICARE revenues, higher Medicare membership, and lower medical cost trends in both Medicare and TRICARE.

compares to cash flows provided by operations for 1H03 of $53,266,000.
Cash flows provided by operations for 1H04 of $24,855,000
Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Cash Flows from Operations
The fixed monthly MedicareAdvantage premium payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") is due to Humana on the first day of each month. However, if the first of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, the company receives that payment on the last business day of the prior month, often resulting in a significant impact on cash flows from operations.
Management believes the difference in timing of this cash event between periods may be so significant as to distort a particular period's trend in operating cash flows. Management believes that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the relevance of a factor to normal operating results. In some cases, large factors or events may obscure short-term patterns and long-term trends. When reviewing and analyzing our cash flow position, management apportions the CMS premium payment in each month. To do otherwise would distort a meaningful analysis of our cash flow. Decisions such as management's forecast or business plans regarding cash flow, therefore, use this non-GAAP financial measure.
The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, to certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company for 2Q04, 2Q03, 1H04 and 1H03.
 
 
 
The year-over-year decline in non-GAAP cash flows from operations both in the second quarter and the first half of the year relates to the timing of the collection of TRICARE bid price adjustment receivables. Amounts similar to those collected in 2Q03 are anticipated to be collected in the third quarter of 2004, in lieu of 2Q04.
Share Repurchase Program
In July 2003, the company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $100 million for the repurchase of its common shares, exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans.
During 2Q04, the company acquired 2,167,500 of its common shares for an aggregate price of $36,129,000, or an average cost of $16.67 per share.
During 1H04, the company acquired 2,853,500 of its common shares for an aggregate price of $50,098,000, or an average cost of $17.56 per share.
As of July 23, 2004 the company had approximately $46,311,000 remaining on its outstanding repurchase authorization.
