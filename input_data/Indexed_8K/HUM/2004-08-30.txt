                ii)  By tendering to the Company shares of the Common Stock of Company owned by him/her prior to the date of exercise and having an aggregate fair market value equal to the cash exercise price applicable to his/her Option; or
                iii)  A combination of 5(B)(i) and 5(B)(ii) above.
         C. Federal, state and local income taxes and other amounts as may be required by law to be collected by the Company in connection with the exercise of this Option shall be paid pursuant to the Plan by Optionee prior to the delivery of any Common Stock under this Agreement.
     6. The Option granted under this Agreement to Optionee may not be assigned, transferred, pledged, alienated or hypothecated in any manner during Optionee's lifetime, but shall be solely and exclusively the right of Optionee to exercise during his/her lifetime. Should Optionee attempt to assign, transfer, pledge, alienate or hypothecate this Option or any rights hereunder in any manner whatsoever, such action shall constitute a breach of the covenants hereunder and Company may terminate this Option as to any then unexercised shares.
 
 
     7. In the event of a Change in Control, as defined in the Plan, this Option shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable in its entirety. In addition, Optionee will be permitted to surrender for cancellation within sixty (60) days after a Change in Control, any portion of this Option to the extent not yet exercised and Optionee will be entitled to receive a payment in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the greater of (1) the Fair Market Value on the date of surrender of the Shares subject to this Option or portion thereof surrendered, or (2) the Fair Market Value, as Adjusted, of the Shares subject to this Option or portion thereof surrendered, over (y) the aggregate purchase price for such Shares under this Option or portion thereof surrendered. The form of payment shall be determined by the Committee.
         In the event Optionee's employment with the Company is terminated other than for Cause within three (3) years following a Change in Control, each Option held by the Optionee that was exercisable as of the date of termination of the Optionee's employment or service shall remain exercisable for a period ending the earlier of the second anniversary of the termination of the Optionee's employment or the expiration of the stated term of the Option.
     8. This Agreement shall be binding and conclusive upon each successor and assign of the Company. It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that the benefits of any appreciation of the underlying Common Stock during the term of the Option shall be preserved in any event, including but not limited to a recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off or similar transaction, or other change in corporate structure affecting the Shares, as more fully described in Section 4.7 of the Plan. All obligations imposed upon Optionee and all rights granted to Optionee and to the Company shall be binding upon Optionee's heirs and legal representatives.
     9. Except as to matters of federal law, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.
 
     10. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any relevant jurisdiction, or would disqualify the Optionee under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan, it shall be stricken and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision in this Agreement determined by competent authority to be in conflict with 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or its successor, in regard to qualifying this Option as an incentive stock option shall be ineffective ab initio to the extent of such conflict.
     11. Any term used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. Any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan will be resolved in favor of the Plan. Any disputes or questions of right or obligation which shall result from or relate to any interpretation of this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee. Any such determination shall be binding and conclusive upon Optionee, his/her assigns, and any person or persons claiming through Optionee as to any rights hereunder.
, Company has caused this Agreement to be executed on its behalf by its duly authorized officer, and Optionee has executed this Agreement, each as of the day first above written.
