Item 1.01   Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
                   On September 29, 2004, we replaced our existing credit agreements (described below) with a new five-year $600 million unsecured revolving credit agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, as Agent and as CAF Loan Agent, Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A., Citibank, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, and Wachovia Bank, National Association as Syndication Agents and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Lead Bookrunner ("New Credit Agreement"). Under the New Credit Agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which varies depending on our credit ratings, ranges from 50 to 112.5 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This faci lity fee, initially 15 basis points, may fluctuate between 12.5 and 37.5 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. In addition to the facility fee, a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points is payable for any day in which borrowings under the facility exceeds 50% of the total $600 million commitment. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis, at our option.
                  The New Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth, minimum interest coverage, and maximum leverage ratios. The term of the New Credit Agreement also includes standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow. We have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. We do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to Humana in the future.
                  We have other relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some parties to the New Credit Agreement.
                  The Company has not received any advances under the New Credit Agreement as of this time.
Item 1.02   Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
                  Prior to September 29, 2004, the Company maintained two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a $265 million, 4-year revolving credit agreement and a $265 million, 364-day revolving credit agreement with a one-year term-out option. A one-year term-out option converted the outstanding borrowings, if any, under the credit agreement to a one-year term loan upon expiration. The 364-day revolving credit agreement expired on September 29, 2004 and the 4-year revolving credit agreement would have expired in October 2005.
                  Under these agreements, at our option, we could borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion of both agreements bore interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which varied depending on our credit ratings, ranged from 80 to 125 basis points for our 4-year agreement, and 85 to 137.5 basis points for our 364-day agreement. We also paid an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee was 20 basis points under the 364-day agreement and 25 basis points under the 4-year agreement at September 29, 2004.
                  These credit agreements contained customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth, minimum interest coverage, and maximum leverage ratios. At September 29, 2004, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenant requirements. The terms of each of these credit agreements also included standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow.
                  There were no balances outstanding under either agreement at September 29, 2004.
Item 2.03   Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance                    Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
                  As discussed above under Item 1.01, on September 29, 2004, the Company entered into the New Credit Agreement. The Company has not received any advances under the New Credit Agreement as of this time.

All utilization fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
provided
The Company agrees to pay to the Agent the other fees in the amounts, and on the dates, agreed to by the Company and the Agent in the fee letter, dated July 29, 2004, between the Agent and the Company. The Agent will distribute to the Banks their respective portions of upfront fees paid by the Company to the Agent, as agreed between the Agent and each Bank.
   Termination or Reduction of Commitments
The Company shall have the right, upon not less than five Business Days' notice to the Agent, to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce ratably the amount of the Commitments, provided that no such termination or reduction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Loans made on the effective date thereof, the then outstanding principal amount of the Loans, when added to the then L/C Obligations, would exceed the amount of the Commitments then in effect. Any such reduction shall be in an amount of $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and shall reduce permanently the amount of the Commitments then in effect.
   Optional Prepayments
The Company may at any time and from time to time, prepay the Revolving Credit Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (subject to the provisions of subsection 2.16), upon at least three Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Agent in the case of Eurodollar Loans and one Business Day's irrevocable notice to the Agent in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans or Alternate Base Rate Loans or a combination thereof, and if of a combination thereof, the amount of prepayment allocable to each. Upon receipt of such notice the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. If such notice is given, the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000, or a whole multiple thereof, and may only be made if, after giv ing effect thereto, subsection 2.7(c) shall not have been contravened.
   Conversion Options; Minimum Amount of Loans
.
The Company may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to Alternate Base Rate Loans by giving the Agent at least two Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election (given before 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the date on which such notice is required), that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans shall, subject to the fourth following sentence, only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Company may elect from time to time to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Agent at least three Working Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election (given before 11:30 A.M., New York City time, on the date on which such notice is required). Upon receipt of such notice, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Promptly following the date on which such conversion is being made each Bank shall take such action as is necessary to transfer its portion of such Revolving Credit Loans to its Domestic Lend ing Office or its Eurodollar Lending Office, as the case may be. All or any part of outstanding Eurodollar Loans and Alternate Base Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein, that, unless the Required Banks otherwise agree, (i) no Revolving Credit Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) partial conversions shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof, and (iii) any such conversion may only be made if, after giving effect thereto, subsection 2.7(c) shall not have been contravened.
provided
provided
Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by the Company with the notice provisions contained in subsection 2.7(a); that, unless the Required Banks otherwise agree, no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, but shall be automatically converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto. The Agent shall notify the Banks promptly that such automatic conversion contemplated by this subsection 2.7(b) will occur.
provided
All borrowings, conversions, payments, prepayments and selection of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Loans comprising any Eurodollar Tranche shall not be less than $10,000,000. At no time shall there be more than six Eurodollar Tranches.
   Interest Rate and Payment Dates for Loans
The Eurodollar Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
Alternate Base Rate Loans shall bear interest for each day from and including the date thereof on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
CAF Loans shall bear interest from the Borrowing Date to the maturity date therefor as set forth in the CAF Loan Request for such CAF Loan on the unpaid principal amount thereof at the rate of interest determined pursuant to subsection 2.2(b).
If all or a portion of the (i) principal amount of any Loans, (ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is 2% above the Alternate Base Rate from the date of such non-payment until paid in full (after as well as before judgment). If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loans shall not be paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), each Eurodollar Loan shall, unless the Required Banks otherwise agree, be converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan at the end of the last Interest Period with respect thereto.
Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.
   Computation of Interest and Fees
Interest in respect of Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a (i) 365-day (or 366-day, as the case may be) year for the actual days elapsed when such Alternate Base Rate Loans are based on the Prime Rate, and (ii) a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed when based on the Base CD Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate. Interest in respect of Eurodollar Loans and CAF Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. The Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Company and the Banks of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Revolving Credit Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate Base Rate or the Applicable Margin or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate is announced, such Applicable Margin changes as provided herein or such change in the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall be come effective, as the case may be. The Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Company and the Banks of the effective date and the amount of each such change.
Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Agent shall, at the request of the Company, deliver to the Company a statement showing the quotations used by the Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 2.8.
If any Reference Bank's Commitment shall terminate (otherwise than on termination of all the Commitments), or its Revolving Credit Loans shall be assigned for any reason whatsoever, such Reference Bank shall thereupon cease to be a Reference Bank, and if, as a result of the foregoing, there shall only be one Reference Bank remaining, then the Agent (after consultation with the Company and the Banks) shall, by notice to the Company and the Banks, designate another Bank as a Reference Bank so that there shall at all times be at least two Reference Banks.
Each Reference Bank shall use its best efforts to furnish quotations of rates to the Agent as contemplated hereby. If any of the Reference Banks shall be unable or otherwise fails to supply such rates to the Agent upon its request, the rate of interest shall be determined on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Reference Banks or Reference Bank.
Facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year for the actual days elapsed.
  Inability to Determine Interest Rate
In the event that:
the Agent shall have determined in its reasonable judgment (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market generally, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period;
only one of the Reference Banks is able to obtain bids for its Dollar deposits for such Interest Period in the manner contemplated by the term "Eurodollar Rate"; or
the Agent shall have received notice prior to the first day of such Interest Period from Banks constituting the Required Banks that the interest rate determined pursuant to subsection 2.8(a) for such Interest Period does not accurately reflect the cost to such Banks (as conclusively certified by such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period;
with respect to (A) proposed Revolving Credit Loans that the Company has requested be made as Eurodollar Loans, (B) Eurodollar Loans that will result from the requested conversion of Alternate Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans or (C) the continuation of Eurodollar Loans beyond the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Agent shall forthwith give facsimile or telephonic notice of such determination to the Company and the Banks at least one day prior to, as the case may be, the requested Borrowing Date for such Eurodollar Loans, the conversion date of such Loans or the last day of such Interest Period. If such notice is given (x) any requested Eurodollar Loans shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans, (y) any Alternate Base Rate Loans that were to have been converted to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as Alternate Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, t o Alternate Base Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made, nor shall the Company have the right to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans. The Agent shall withdraw such notice upon its determination that the event or events which gave rise to such notice no longer exist.
  Pro Rata Borrowings and Payments
Each borrowing by the Company of Revolving Credit Loans shall be made ratably from the Banks in accordance with their Commitment Percentages.
Whenever any payment received by the Agent under this Agreement or any Note is insufficient to pay in full all amounts then due and payable to the Agent and the Banks under this Agreement and the Notes, and the Agent has not received a Payment Sharing Notice (or if the Agent has received a Payment Sharing Notice but the Event of Default specified in such Payment Sharing Notice has been cured or waived), such payment shall be distributed and applied by the Agent and the Banks in the following order: , to the payment of fees and expenses due and payable to the Agent under and in connection with this Agreement; , to the payment of all expenses due and payable under subsection 10.5(a), ratably among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate amount of such payments owed to each such Bank; , to the payment of fees due and payable under (i) subsection 2.4, ratably among the Banks in accordance with their Commitment Percentages, (ii) the first sentence of subsection 3.3(a) r atably among the L/C Participants in accordance with their Commitment Percentage and (iii) the second sentence of subsection 3.3(a) to the Issuing Bank; , to the payment of interest then due and payable on the Loans, ratably among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate amount of interest owed to each such Bank; and , to the payment of the principal amount of the Loans which is then due and payable, ratably among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate principal amount owed to each such Bank.

All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Company on account of principal, interest and fees shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and shall be made to the Agent, for the account of the Banks, at the Agent's office set forth in subsection 10.2, in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds. The Agent shall distribute such payments to the Banks promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the CAF Loans made pursuant to a LIBOR Auction Advance Request) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a CAF Loan made pursuant to a LIBOR Auction Advance Request becomes due and payable on a day other than a Working Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeedi ng Working Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Working Day.
Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Bank prior to a Borrowing Date that such Bank will not make the amount which would constitute its Commitment Percentage of the borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans on such date available to the Agent, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such amount available to the Agent on such Borrowing Date, and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Agent on a date after such Borrowing Date, such Bank shall pay to the Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such period as quoted by the Agent, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Borrowing Date to the date on which such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing shall have become immedi ately available to the Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection 2.11(e) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing is not in fact made available to the Agent by such Bank within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Company.
  Illegality
. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if after the date hereof the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the Bank shall, within 30 Working Days after it becomes aware of such fact, notify the Company, through the Agent, of such fact, (b) the commitment of such Bank hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans or convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be cancelled and (c) such Bank's Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Alternate Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods for such Revolving Credit Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. Each Bank shall take such action as may be reasonably available to it without material legal or financial disadvantage (including changing its Eurod ollar Lending Office) to prevent the adoption of or any change in any such Requirement of Law from becoming applicable to it.
  Requirements of Law
. If after the date hereof the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date hereof from any central bank or other Governmental Authority:
shall subject any Bank to any tax of any kind whatsoever (other than a withholding tax) with respect to this Agreement, any Revolving Credit Note, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Eurodollar Loans made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Bank of principal, facility fee, interest or any other amount payable hereunder in respect of Revolving Credit Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank);
shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank which are not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate hereunder; or
shall impose on such Bank any other condition;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank, by any amount which such Bank reasonably deems to be material, of making, renewing or maintaining advances or extensions of credit (including, without limitation, issuing or participating in Letters of Credit) or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder, in each case, in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Company shall promptly pay such Bank, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable; , however, that notwithstanding anything contained in this subsection 2.13(a) to the contrary, such Bank shall not be entitled to receive any amounts pursuant to this subsection 2.13(a) that it is also entitled to pursuant to subsection 2.15(a). If a Bank becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection 2.13(a), it shall, within 30 Business Days after it becomes aware of such fact, notify the Company, through th e Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by such Bank, through the Agent, to the Company shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Each Bank shall take such action as may be reasonably available to it without legal or financial disadvantage (including changing its Eurodollar Lending Office) to prevent any such Requirement of Law or change from becoming applicable to it. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and payment of the outstanding Revolving Credit Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.
provided
In the event that after the date hereof a Bank is required to maintain reserves of the type contemplated by the definition of "Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements", such Bank may require the Company to pay, promptly after receiving notice of the amount due, additional interest on the related Eurodollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per annum determined by such Bank up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable Eurodollar Rate divided by (B) one the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements over (ii) the applicable Eurodollar Rate. Any Bank wishing to require payment of any such additional interest on account of any of its Eurodollar Loans shall notify the Company no more than 30 Working Days after each date on which interest is payable on such Eurodollar Loan of the amount then due it under this subsection 2.13(b), in which case such additional interest on such Eurodollar Loan shall be payable to such Bank at the place indicated in such notice. Each such notification shall be accompanied by such information as the Company may reasonably request.

  Capital Adequacy
. If any Bank shall have determined that after the date hereof the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank with any request or directive after the date hereof regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or Governmental Authority, does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Bank or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount which is reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, promptly after submission by such Bank, through the Agent, to the Company of a writt en request therefor (such request shall include details reasonably sufficient to establish the basis for such additional amounts payable and shall be submitted to the Company within 30 Working Days after it becomes aware of such fact), the Company shall promptly pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such reduction.

If any Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Agent or any Bank hereunder or under the Notes, the amounts so payable to the Agent or such Bank shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Agent or such Bank (after payment of all Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the Notes. Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Company, as promptly as possible thereafter, the Company shall send to the Agent for its own account or for the account of such Bank, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt that is received by the Company showing payment thereof (or, if no official receipt is received by the Company, a statement of the Company indicating payment thereof). If the Company fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Company shall indemnify the Agent and the Banks for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Bank as a result of any such failure, except to the extent such failure is attributable to a failure by a Non-U.S. Bank to comply with the form delivery and notice requirements of paragraph (b) below.
Each Bank (or Transferee) that is not a citizen or resident of the United States of America, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States of America (or any jurisdiction thereof), or any estate or trust that is subject to federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income (a "") shall deliver to the Company and the Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Bank from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Bank claiming complete exemption from, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Company under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Bank on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Bank shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Bank. Each Non-U.S. Bank shall promptly notify the Company at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Company (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Bank shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Bank is not legally able to deliver, , , that in the event that the failure to be able to deliver such form is not attributable to a change in law, the Company shall be relieved of the obligation to make additional payments under subsection 2.15(a) above.

Any Bank claiming any amount under this subsection 2.16 shall provide calculations, in reasonable detail, of the amount of its loss or expense. This covenant shall survive termination of this Agreement and payment of the outstanding Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
  Application of Proceeds of Loans
. Subject to the provisions of the following sentence, the Company may use the proceeds of the Loans for any lawful general corporate purpose, including acquisitions. The Company will not, directly or indirectly, apply any part of the proceeds of any such Loan for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any Margin Stock within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U, or to refund any indebtedness incurred for such purpose, provided that the Company may use the proceeds of Loans for such purposes, if such usage does not violate Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.
  Notice of Certain Circumstances; Assignment of Commitments Under Certain Circumstances
. Any Bank claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to subsections 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 or exercising its rights under subsection 2.12, shall, in accordance with the respective provisions thereof, provide notice to the Company and the Agent.

In the event that the Company shall be required to make any additional payments to any Bank pursuant to subsections 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 or any Bank shall exercise its rights under subsection 2.12, the Company shall have the right at its own expense, upon notice to such Bank and the Agent, to require such Bank to transfer and to assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the terms of subsection 10.6) all its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to another financial institution (including any Bank) acceptable to the Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) which shall assume such obligations; that (i) no such assignment shall conflict with any Requirement of Law and (ii) such assuming financial institution shall pay to such Bank in immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the outstanding principal amount of such Bank's Loans together with accrued interest thereon and all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it he reunder, including, but not limited to additional amounts payable under subsections 2.4, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16.

Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Bank that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Bank is not reimbursed in full by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Bank upon demand at the Issuing Bank's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participa nt's Commitment Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed.

  Changes in Condition
. Since December 31, 2003, there has been no development or event nor any prospective development or event, which has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.
   Assets
. The Company and each Subsidiary have good and marketable title to all material assets carried on their books and reflected in the financial statements referred to in subsection 4.6 or furnished pursuant to subsection 6.4, except for assets held on Financing Leases or purchased subject to security devices providing for retention of title in the vendor, and except for assets disposed of as permitted by this Agreement.
   Tax Returns
. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid, or made adequate provision for the payment of, all taxes which have or may become due pursuant to said returns or to assessments received.

The Company knows of no material additional assessments since said date for which adequate reserves have not been established.
   Contracts, etc
. Attached hereto as Schedule III is a statement of outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries for borrowed money in excess of $2,000,000 as of the date set forth therein, and a complete and correct list of all agreements, contracts, indentures, instruments, documents and amendments thereto to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound pursuant to which any such Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries is outstanding on the date hereof.

. As of the date hereof, the Company has only the Subsidiaries set forth in Schedule IV, all of the outstanding capital stock of each of which is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned as set forth in said Schedule IV.

  Burdensome Obligations
.

The Company and its Subsidiaries have met all of the funding standards applicable to all Plans that are not Multiemployer Plans, except where failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and there exists no event or condition which would permit the institution of proceedings to terminate any Plan that is not a Multiemployer Plan which could reason ably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The current value of the benefits guaranteed under Title IV of ERISA of each Plan that is not a Multiemployer Plan does not exceed the current value of such Plan's assets allocable to such benefits by an amount greater than $50,000,000 at any one time.

. The Company and each Subsidiary has complied with all applicable Federal, state, and other laws, rules and regulations relating to environmental pollution or to environmental regulation or control or to public or employee health or safety, except to the extent that the failure to so comply would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

The Company is aware of no events, conditions or circumstances involving environmental pollution or contamination or public or employee health or safety, in each case applicable to it or its Subsidiaries, that would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
  Federal Regulations

  Business Activity
. Except as set forth on Schedule VIII, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged in any line of business that is not related to the healthcare industry other than the sale of life insurance in connection with the sale of medical insurance or other healthcare services, sale of long term care insurance, or any business or activity which is immaterial to the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
  Purpose of Loans
. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used to repay any amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreements and to finance any other lawful general corporate purpose, including commercial paper backup and acquisitions, that no part of the proceeds of any Loans will be used in any transaction or for any purpose which violates the provisions of Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.
