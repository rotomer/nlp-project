Diluted earnings per common share increased 37 percent
Government segment earnings up 32 percent; Commercial segment earnings up 49 percent
Year-to-date operating cash flows increased 167 percent
Earnings and cash flow guidance raised
 
     LOUISVILLE, KY (November 1, 2004) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported a 37 percent rise in diluted earnings per common share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004 (3Q04), with $0.52 in diluted earnings per common share in 3Q04 compared to $0.38 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 (3Q03). Results for 3Q04 reflect the combination of several positive elements: solid performance by the company's Medicare business, a more profitable Commercial segment customer risk mix, the continuation of a smooth transition to the company's new TRICARE contract, TRICARE bid price adjustments coming in higher than expected, and on-going administrative cost discipline.
     "Humana's diversification strategy is playing out very well, as evidenced by this quarter's results," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "We've exceeded our previous expectations for this quarter as a result of higher contributions from our Government segment, while our Commercial segment continues to show great improvement over the prior year. Our broad portfolio of traditional and consumer-choice Commercial products and Medicare offerings, together with our TRICARE business, have created numerous earnings opportunities while mitigating risks associated with any one particular line of business."
     Humana is raising its earnings guidance for 2004 to a range of $1.66 to $1.69 per diluted share and expects that momentum to continue into 2005 when the company forecasts diluted earnings per common share of between $1.90 and $1.95, with higher year-over-year earnings anticipated in each of its business segments.
     Diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 (the 2004 Period) increased 42 percent to $1.43 compared to $1.01 diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 (the 2003 Period). This year-to-date increase in earnings includes higher contributions from each of the company's business segments. The 2003 Period includes $0.05 in net expenses per diluted share for the write-down in building and equipment, gain on the sale of a venture capital investment, and software abandonment charges.
     Projected earnings for the full year 2004 include estimated fourth quarter diluted earnings per common share of $0.23 to $0.26. To further enhance the company's 2005 MedicareAdvantage sales prospects, it anticipates higher 4Q04 investment spending in the related sales support processes than previously planned.
     As discussed in the company's second quarter 2004 earnings release dated July 26, 2004, 2004 unusual items are anticipated to offset each other. No related earnings impact on the full year is expected. The company's earnings guidance for 2005 does not include any unusual items.
     
Commercial Segment Results
     Commercial segment pretax earnings rose 49 percent versus 3Q03 to $38.7 million in 3Q04, reflecting a more profitable business mix with the lapse of certain under-performing at-risk accounts and significant increases in self-funded and Individual-product members.
     Pretax earnings for the 2004 Period in the Commercial segment of $114.7 million rose 7 percent compared to those for the 2003 Period, the combined effect of operating improvements from the previously discussed changes in Commercial membership, together with the beneficial effect of $5.4 million in unusual net pretax expenses in the 2003 Period.
     The company continues to forecast Commercial segment pretax earnings of approximately $140 million for the full year 2004 and expects the related 2005 earnings to increase between 10 and 15 percent. The projected 2005 beneficial effect from the lapse of a large unprofitable account and growth in self-funded and Individual product membership is expected to be partially offset by reduced income associated with lower average membership in the 3-to-300 case size fully insured customers.
     
Commercial Segment Enrollment
     Commercial segment medical membership of 3,315,200 at September 30, 2004 increased 9 percent from the prior year, driven by membership added through the April 2004 acquisition of Ochsner Health Plan as well as significant gains in the company's self-funded and Individual product lines. As expected, during 3Q04 certain under-performing accounts lapsed, with total membership in these accounts approximating 94,000 members. These non-renewals contributed to a net sequential decline in commercial medical membership of approximately 89,200.
     Membership in the company's consumer-choice Smart plans increased to 241,400 at September 30, 2004, up 121 percent from a year ago and up 6,800 members versus June 30, 2004.
     The company anticipates total Commercial medical enrollment growth for 2004 to approximate 220,000 to 230,000 members, including 152,600 members acquired through the April 2004 Ochsner Health Plan acquisition. Significant year-to-date membership gains in self-funded and Individual product lines are anticipated to be partially offset by continued attrition in the company's fully insured business lines due to the ongoing competitive environment within the 3-to-300 case size fully insured customers.
     The company has received notice that it will not retain an 89,000-member fully insured account effective January 1, 2005. This account had not been profitable for the company during 2004. Excluding the impact of this one account, Humana is forecasting its commercial segment medical membership to be slightly higher in 2005 versus 2004.
     
Commercial Segment Premiums and Medical Costs
     Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial segment increased 7 percent to $1.8 billion in 3Q04 compared to the prior year's quarter. For the 2004 Period, Commercial segment premiums and administrative services fees increased 8 percent to $5.4 billion versus $5.0 billion in the 2003 Period.
     Commercial segment premiums for fully insured medical membership increased in the range of 6 to 8 percent on a per-member basis during 3Q04 compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase reflects the same changes in business mix discussed by the company in prior 2004 quarters (primarily a shift towards more Individual product membership).
     The company anticipates its full year 2004 commercial premiums for fully insured membership to increase in the range of 6 to 8 percent on a per-member basis. This range includes the estimated impact of an increasing mix of fully insured membership in the company's Individual product, the premium for which lowers Humana's overall average per-member premium increase by approximately 150 to 200 basis points as this product has a correspondingly lower benefit than other fully insured Commercial medical products.
     In 3Q04, the Commercial segment medical expense ratio (medical expenses divided by premium revenues) of 83.6 percent was 10 basis points lower than in 3Q03, despite the 2004 impact of the large unprofitable account, due in large part to the 3Q04 lapses of the underperforming accounts previously described. For the 2004 Period, the medical expense ratio of 83.9 percent increased 120 basis points year over year, due to a combination of the effect of this unprofitable account and strategically planned pricing actions.
     Per-member medical costs for the Commercial fully insured business are now forecast to rise in the range of 6.5 percent to 8.5 percent, including the lowering effect of approximately 200 basis points from a higher mix of Individual membership year over year.
     For 2005, increases in Commercial fully insured medical product per-member premiums and medical costs are both anticipated to be in the 6.5 to 8.5 percent range, including similar effects related to the Individual product as experienced in 2004.
     
Government Segment Results
     Government segment pretax earnings increased 32 percent versus 3Q03 to $88.8 million in 3Q04. Results reflected the combination of lower medical and SG&A expense ratios for its Medicare products and higher earnings associated with TRICARE bid price adjustments accrued and collected in 3Q04.
     For the 2004 Period, Government segment pretax earnings of $237.9 million increased 72 percent versus the 2003 Period driven by similar improved performance for its MedicareAdvantage products, changes in TRICARE quarterly earnings patterns, and the net negative impact upon the 2003 Period of $10.1 million in pretax expense for unusual items.
     For 2005, the company expects a continuing increase in earnings in its Government segment, driven by increases in results from both Medicare and TRICARE operations.
     
TRICARE South Region Contract
     On November 1, 2004, the company's subsidiary, Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc., added approximately 1 million TRICARE members in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana to its South Region contract with the Department of Defense. The addition of these members completes the membership transition associated with the implementation of this contract, which began on August 1, 2004.
     
Government Segment Enrollment
     MedicareAdvantage membership continued to increase in 3Q04, totaling 371,300 at September 30, 2004, up 46,700 members year over year and up 3,400 members sequentially. The previously described Ochsner Health Plan transaction resulted in the addition of 33,100 MedicareAdvantage members.
     The company expects total MedicareAdvantage membership growth (including the previously described acquisition) for 2004 to approximate 15 percent.
     For 2005, investments in sales support processes, continued growth in the company's Medicare HMO products, expanded participation in the Private Fee for Service program and expected participation in local PPOs are together anticipated to result in year-over-year organic growth in MedicareAdvantage membership of approximately 10 to 15 percent.
     TRICARE membership of 1,813,300 at September 30, 2004 declined by 990,000 members year over year. As expected, on July 1, 2004, approximately 1.1 million members transitioned to another contractor in connection with the new TRICARE contracts being implemented by the Department of Defense, resulting in the sequential decline in membership for the quarter.
     As described above, on November 1, 2004, Humana added approximately 1 million TRICARE members as the final membership transition associated with its new South Region contract with the Department of Defense became effective, increasing total TRICARE membership to approximately 2.8 million.
     The company anticipates its TRICARE membership to remain at this higher level through the end of 2004, with no material changes forecast for 2005.
     
Government Segment Premiums and Medical Costs
     MedicareAdvantage premiums per member increased substantially year over year during 3Q04 as a result of changes enacted into law during 2003. Per-member premiums for the company's MedicareAdvantage business increased in the range of 12 to 14 percent during 3Q04 primarily driven by results of the company's efforts to ensure its premium allocations from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") accurately reflect the risk profile of its membership.
     Inclusive of the run-rate effect of the higher 3Q04 risk-adjustment premium, the company continues to anticipate MedicareAdvantage per-member premium increases to be in the range of 9 to 11 percent for the full year 2004, with a range of 5 to 7 percent forecast for 2005.
     Increases in year-over-year MedicareAdvantage medical costs per member are forecast to be in the range of 9 to 11 percent for all of 2004, with a range of 5 to 7 percent anticipated for 2005.
      TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees during 3Q04 of $405.0 million reflect the implementation of the new South Region contract with the Department of Defense, which included a reduction in the benefits and services previously provided, and thus, lower revenues. On a year-over-year basis, TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees declined approximately 38 percent in 3Q04 and increased less than 1 percent for the 2004 Period, as expected.
      The company forecasts TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees for the full year 2004 will approximate $2.2 billion, including the effect of higher 3Q04 bid price adjustment premium.
      
Impact of Hurricanes
     During 3Q04, the company's operations in Florida and Louisiana experienced an unusually strong hurricane season. However, the company estimates that aggregated medical expenses associated with claims for these regions were not significantly affected during the quarter. The company indicated that the expected reduction or deferral of planned elective procedures and physician office visits was offset by higher hospital admissions resulting from limited access to more efficient care during the temporary closure of physician offices and nursing homes.
    
 
Selling, General & Administrative Expenses
     Continued discipline in operational spending resulted in a 30 basis point year-over-year decline in the company's consolidated Selling, General, & Administrative ("SG&A") ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) of 14.6 percent for 3Q04.
     Each of the segments also saw improvement in the SG&A ratio during 3Q04, with the Commercial segment's ratio declining by 30 basis points and the Government segment's ratio down by 40 basis points. For the 2004 Period, the year-over-year declines were even more substantial with the consolidated SG&A ratio of 14.5 percent declining 80 basis points, the combined effect of a 50 basis point decline in the Commercial segment SG&A ratio and a 110 basis point decline in the Government segment ratio.
     For the full year 2004, the company expects its consolidated SG&A ratio to range between 14 and 15 percent, with a forecasted range of 16 to 17 percent for the Commercial segment and 11 to 12 percent for the Government segment. The company's 2005 consolidated SG&A ratio is projected to be in the range of 13.5 to 14.5 percent.
     
Cash Flows from Operations
     Cash flows provided by operations for 3Q04 of $303.5 million compares favorably to cash flows provided by operations for 3Q03 of $69.7 million as the rise in net income combined with the timing of the collection of TRICARE bid price adjustment receivables in the current year versus the prior year more than offset the negative effect of timing associated with TRICARE members that transitioned to the new contract on August 1, 2004. For the 2004 Period, cash flows from operations increased over that for the prior year's period by 167 percent to $328.3 million.
     For the full year 2004, cash flows from operations under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") are anticipated to be in the range of $288 million to $338 million, an average increase of approximately $25 million from the company's cash flow guidance issued on September 30, 2004. This revised forecast includes the negative impact of $211.9 million related to the December 2003 receipt of the January 2004 MedicareAdvantage premium payment from CMS. The full year 2004 projected cash flows from operations also gives consideration to the negative effect of timing associated with TRICARE members that transitioned to the new contract on November 1, 2004.
     During 3Q04 CMS published its 2005 monthly Medicare premium payment schedule, which included a change from its previous practice. As a result of this change, the payment originally scheduled to be made to health plans on Friday, December 31, 2004, has been changed to Monday, January 3, 2005, or one business day later, resulting in the anticipated receipt of only 11 monthly Medicare premium payments from CMS during 2004.
     
Non-GAAP Cash Flows from Operations
     When reviewing and analyzing Humana's cash flow position, company management apportions the CMS premium payment in each month to match disbursements. To do otherwise distorts meaningful analysis of our operating cash flow. Therefore, decisions such as management's forecasting and business plans regarding cash flow use this non-GAAP financial measure.
     For 3Q04 and 3Q03, the non-GAAP cash flows from operations were the same as the cash flows from operations under GAAP due to the timing of the premium payments received from CMS.
     The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable historical and projected financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, to the historical and projected non-GAAP financial measures:
 
     
Balance Sheet
     The company's financial liquidity remained strong in 3Q04 with 56 percent of total assets in cash and investment securities at September 30, 2004 versus 55 percent at December 31, 2003.
     Debt as a percent of total capitalization (debt plus stockholders' equity) of 23.8 percent was down 210 basis points from December 31, 2003 and 80 basis points sequentially.
     Days in claims payable increased sequentially to 51.8 at September 30, 2004 from 47.4 days at June 30, 2004, primarily as a result of the temporary effect upon this statistic of the transition between TRICARE contracts. Components of Humana's medical claims reserves and historical trends in the related operational statistics are disclosed in detail in the statistics pages included with this earnings press release.
     
Share Repurchase Program
     During 3Q04, the company acquired 782,500 of its common shares for an aggregate price of $13.6 million, or an average cost of $17.35 per share. During the 2004 Period, the company acquired 3,636,000 of its common shares for an aggregate price of $63.6 million, or an average cost of $17.49 per share. As of October 31, 2004 the company had approximately $36 million remaining on its currently authorized $100 million share repurchase program.
