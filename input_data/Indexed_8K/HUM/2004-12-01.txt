     LOUISVILLE, KY (December 1, 2004) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today announced that its management team will be hosting an Investor Day in New York City on Thursday, December 2, 2004. The company's Investor Day will include presentations by various members of management regarding Humana's strategic, operational and financial progress to date and future earnings guidance. Humana's event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 a.m. eastern.
     In conjunction with the meeting, the company is raising its guidance for diluted earnings per common share for 2004 to approximately $1.69, at the higher-end of its previous guidance range of $1.66 to $1.69, with 2005 expected to be a 15 percent increase over the current 2004 estimate. Other earnings guidance points anticipated to be discussed at the Investor Day are detailed in this release.
     The attached guidance points include projections for cash flows from operations that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). When reviewing and analyzing Humana's cash flow position, company management apportions the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") premium payment in each month to match disbursements. To do otherwise distorts meaningful analysis of the company's operating cash flow. Therefore, decisions such as management's forecasting and business plans regarding cash flow use this non-GAAP measurement.
     Humana invites the investing public and the media to listen to its Investor Day via the Internet. A live virtual presentation (audio with slides) will be available and may be accessed via Humana's Investor Relations page at www.humana.com. The company suggests web participants sign on approximately 15 minutes in advance of the meeting. The company also suggests web participants visit the site well in advance of the call to run a system test and to download any free software needed to view the presentation.
