2004 earnings per share up 22 percent
4Q04 pretax results consistent with company's recently raised guidance
Year-over-year growth in Medicare membership of 15 percent
2004 Commercial segment pretax earnings of $142 million, up 17 percent
Cash flows from operations (non-GAAP) of $560 million, up 38 percent for the year
     LOUISVILLE, KY (February 7, 2005) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported a 22 percent increase in diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the year ended December 31, 2004 (FY 2004), with $1.72 EPS compared to $1.41 EPS for the year ended December 31, 2003 (FY 2003). Factors contributing to the rise in the company's performance for the year include improvement in each of the company's business segments, with strong results from Medicare and further progress in commercial operations.
     The company earned $0.29 per diluted common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 (4Q04), with pretax results consistent with the company's guidance raised in early December 2004.
     "Our Medicare results confirmed how our commitment to this market enhanced our position both financially and strategically as we increased our already robust experience with the senior consumer. Additionally, our leadership in consumer-oriented health plans and an improving product mix fueled further progress in our commercial business," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "The fourth quarter was a solid finish to a great year. As strong as 2004 was for us, emerging opportunities in both the Government and Commercial segments make our prospects for 2005 and beyond even stronger."
     The company now expects EPS for the year ending December 31, 2005 (FY 2005) to approximate $2.05, an increase from its previous guidance of $1.95 EPS. The $0.10 increase in estimated EPS results primarily from the anticipated positive impact of a federal income tax gain contingency to be realized in the first quarter of 2005, partially offset by an increase in estimated average diluted shares outstanding for 2005 driven by recent share price appreciation. The company's estimate for pretax income in 2005 remains an increase in excess of 15 percent over 2004, with increases anticipated from both of the company's business segments.
     FY 2004 EPS included net income of $0.03 per share from the gain on the sale of a venture capital investment, the adjustment of estimated federal income taxes payable, accelerated depreciation for software abandonment, and expenses primarily related to severance costs associated with corporate rightsizing. A favorable adjustment of estimated federal income taxes payable, totaling $0.03 per share, occurred during 4Q04 in connection with the company's assessment of income tax contingencies.
     FY 2003 EPS included net expenses of $0.05 per share from the write-down of building and equipment, gain on the sale of a venture capital investment, and accelerated depreciation for software abandonment.
     Results for 4Q04 of $0.29 EPS compare to $0.41 EPS for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 (4Q03). As previously discussed, this reduction resulted from the company entering into a new TRICARE contract in the latter half of 2004. The prior contracts resulted in a concentration of TRICARE earnings in the calendar fourth quarter of each year while the current contract results in more ratable earnings throughout the year. The 4Q04 effect of this TRICARE change was partially offset by improved fourth quarter performance in the company's Medicare and commercial operations.
     
Commercial Segment Results
     Commercial segment pretax earnings rose to $27.3 million in 4Q04 from $14.1 million in 4Q03, reflecting a more profitable business mix with significant increases in administrative services only (ASO) and individual product (HumanaOne) members.
     Pretax earnings for FY 2004 in the Commercial segment of $142.0 million rose 17 percent compared to those for FY 2003, driven by operating improvements from the previously discussed changes in commercial membership.
     The company expects FY 2005 Commercial segment pretax earnings to increase between 10 and 15 percent over FY 2004. The projected 2005 beneficial effect from the lapse of a large unprofitable account and growth in ASO and HumanaOne product membership is expected to be partially offset by reduced income associated with lower average membership in the 3-to-300 case size fully insured customers.
     
Commercial Segment Enrollment
     Commercial segment medical membership of 3,305,100 at December 31, 2004 increased 8 percent from the prior year, driven by net organic growth of 306,200 members in the company's ASO business, 152,600 members added through the April 2004 acquisition of Ochsner Health Plan, and nearly 59,000 new HumanaOne product members, partially offset by continued attrition in the company's fully insured business lines due to the ongoing competitive environment within the 3-to-300 case size fully insured customers. The company was successful in achieving organic commercial medical membership growth in excess of 87,000, or approximately 2.8 percent in FY 2004.
     The company's leadership in engaging consumers continues to be evidenced through growth in both its Smart offerings and other consumer-focused high deductible plans. At December 31, 2004, 9 percent of the company's commercial medical membership was in these plans, up from 4 percent at December 31, 2003.
     Effective January 1, 2005, an 89,000-member fully insured account, which had been unprofitable during FY 2004, lapsed. Excluding the impact of this account, Humana is forecasting its Commercial segment medical membership to be slightly higher for 2005 versus 2004.
     
Commercial Segment Premiums and Medical Costs
     Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial segment increased 4 percent to $1.8 billion in 4Q04 compared to the prior year's quarter. For FY 2004, Commercial segment premiums and administrative services fees increased 7 percent to $7.1 billion versus $6.7 billion in FY 2003.
     Commercial segment premiums for fully insured medical membership increased in the range of 5.5 to 7.5 percent on a per-member basis during 4Q04 compared to the same period in the prior year. FY 2004 commercial premiums for fully insured membership increased in the range of 6 to 8 percent on a per-member basis.
     The ranges of per-member premium increase for both 4Q04 and FY 2004 include the estimated impact of an increasing mix of fully insured membership in the company's HumanaOne product, the premium for which lowered Humana's overall average per-member premium increase by approximately 150 to 200 basis points as this product has a correspondingly lower benefit than other fully insured commercial medical products.
     In 4Q04, the Commercial segment medical expense ratio (medical expenses divided by premium revenues) of 83.9 percent was 30 basis points higher than in 4Q03, driven by the 2004 impact of the large unprofitable account. For FY 2004, the medical expense ratio of 83.9 percent increased 100 basis points year over year, in line with previous company guidance. This increase was driven by a combination of the effect of the unprofitable 89,000-member account and strategically planned pricing actions.
     Per-member medical costs for the commercial fully insured business are forecast to rise in the range of 6.5 to 8.5 percent in 2005, including the lowering effect of approximately 200 basis points from a higher mix of HumanaOne membership year over year. These estimates are consistent with per-member increases in commercial medical costs experienced in FY 2004.
     
Government Segment Results
     As expected, Government segment pretax earnings were $35.9 million in 4Q04 compared to $85.7 million in 4Q03. The profitability effect of the previously discussed TRICARE contract change in 4Q04 was partially offset by improvements in the performance of the segment's MedicareAdvantage business. Results for 4Q04 also include additional investment spending to position the company to take advantage of the substantial Medicare opportunities in 2005 and beyond.
     For FY 2004, Government segment pretax earnings of $273.8 million increased 22 percent versus FY 2003, primarily from improved performance in its MedicareAdvantage products.
For 2005, the company expects a continuing increase in earnings in its Government segment, driven by improvements in results from both Medicare and TRICARE operations.
     
Government Segment Enrollment
     MedicareAdvantage membership continued to increase in 4Q04, totaling 377,200 at December 31, 2004, up 48,600 members year over year and up 5,900 members sequentially. The previously described Ochsner Health Plan transaction resulted in the addition of 33,100 MedicareAdvantage members during the second quarter of 2004.
     For 2005, year-over-year organic growth in MedicareAdvantage membership is anticipated to approximate 10 to 15 percent as a result of investments in sales and marketing, continued growth in the company's Medicare HMO products and expanded participation in Private-Fee-for-Service and local PPO programs. Humana's pending acquisition of CarePlus Health Plans of Florida (CarePlus) is expected to add approximately 50,000 more MedicareAdvantage members upon the completion of the transaction.
     On November 1, 2004, Humana added approximately 1 million TRICARE members as the final membership transition associated with its new South Region contract with the Department of Defense became effective. TRICARE membership of 2,871,800 at December 31, 2004 compares to 2,906,900 at December 31, 2003. The company anticipates no material changes to its TRICARE membership levels in 2005.
     
Government Segment Premiums and Medical Costs
     MedicareAdvantage premiums per member increased in the range of 8 to 10 percent year over year during 4Q04, reflecting higher reimbursement associated with the Medicare Modernization Act .
     FY 2004 MedicareAdvantage premiums per member increased in the range of 9 to 11 percent. The company anticipates a range of 9 to 11 percent for 2005 as per-member premium continues to benefit from the processes the company has established to ensure its premiums from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) accurately reflect the risk profile of its membership.
     MedicareAdvantage medical costs per member increased year over year in the range of 9 to 11 percent for FY 2004, with a range of 9 to 11 percent anticipated for 2005.
     TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees during 4Q04 of $486.9 million reflect the implementation of the new South Region contract with the Department of Defense, which included a reduction in the benefits and services previously provided, and thus, lower revenues. Additionally, the timing of revenue recognition within each option period under the South Region contract differs from that under prior TRICARE contracts. Due to the South Region contract transition period, 4Q04 did not experience a full complement of revenues and membership. These differences accounted for the expected year-over-year decline in TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees of approximately 27 percent in 4Q04 and 7 percent for FY 2004.
     For 2005, the company anticipates TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees to approximate $2.5 billion as the company experiences a full year under the new South Region contract with the second option period scheduled to begin April 1, 2005.
     
Selling, General & Administrative Expenses
     The company's consolidated Selling, General, & Administrative (SG&A) expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) was 14.5 percent for 4Q04, with continued discipline in administrative spending producing a 110 basis point year-over-year decline. Each of the segments also saw improvement in the SG&A expense ratio during 4Q04, with the Commercial segment's ratio declining by 70 basis points and the Government segment's ratio down by 160 basis points.
     For FY 2004, the year-over-year decline was also substantial, resulting in a consolidated SG&A expense ratio of 14.5 percent, a decline of 90 basis points. This was the combined effect of a 50 basis point decline in the Commercial segment expense ratio and a 120 basis point decline in the Government segment ratio.
     The company's 2005 consolidated SG&A expense ratio is projected to be in the range of 13.5 to 14.5 percent. The expected lower SG&A expense ratio should result from the beneficial effect of both growth in membership leveraging fixed costs and management's continued focus on streamlining administrative costs through process design and technology improvements.
     
Cash Flows from Operations
     Cash flows provided by operations for FY 2004 of $347.8 million exceeded the company's expectations, but decreased 16 percent from $413.1 million in FY 2003 due to a change implemented by CMS in the timing of its January premium remittance. This change resulted in the company receiving only 11 monthly CMS premium payments in FY 2004.
     Cash flows provided by operations during 4Q04 were $19.5 million compared to $290.2 million in 4Q03 and reflect the CMS revenue and TRICARE contract timing changes described above.
     Cash flows from operations under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for FY 2004 include the negative impact of $211.9 million related to the December 2003 receipt of the January 2004 MedicareAdvantage premium payment from CMS.
     The company anticipates cash flows from operations for FY 2005 will be in the range of $600 million to $650 million driven by expected higher earnings.
     
Non-GAAP Cash Flows from Operations
     When reviewing and analyzing Humana's cash flow position, company management applies the CMS premium payment in each month to match the corresponding disbursements. To do otherwise distorts meaningful analysis of the company's operating cash flow. Therefore, decisions such as management's forecasting and business plans regarding cash flow use this non-GAAP financial measure.
     The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable historical and projected financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, to the historical and projected non-GAAP financial measures:
     
Balance Sheet
     The company's financial liquidity remained strong in 4Q04 with 54 percent of total assets in cash and investment securities at December 31, 2004, unchanged from December 31, 2003.
     Debt as a percent of total capitalization (debt plus stockholders' equity) of 23.3 percent declined 260 basis points from December 31, 2003 and 50 basis points sequentially.
     Cash and investment securities at the parent company of $439.3 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $399.4 million at December 31, 2003, an increase of 10 percent.
 
     
Acquisition of CarePlus
     On December 14, 2004, the company announced an agreement to acquire CarePlus as well as its affiliated ten CAC-Florida Medical Centers, and PrescibIT Rx pharmacy management company. CarePlus provides MedicareAdvantage HMO plans and benefits to approximately 50,000 Medicare eligibles in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is currently expected to close in the latter part of 1Q05.
     The acquisition is anticipated to be immediately accretive to earnings, adding EPS of $0.15 to $0.18 during the initial 12 months, net of acquisition integration costs.
