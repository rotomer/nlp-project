Item 1.01   Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
Two Amendments of Solicitation/Modification of Contract ("Amendments") to the contract between Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc. ("HMHS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana Inc., and the United States Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity ("TMA") concerning Humana's contract with TMA for administration of the TRICARE program in TMA's South Region became effective as of April 1, 2005. A copy of each of the Amendments is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
                  
                  One Amendment extends the term of the contract through Option Period II, which runs from April 1, 2005 to March 31, 2006. The other Amendment incorporates into the contract the parties' negotiated target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee for Option Period II.
                  Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc. ("HMHS"), headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, has been a TMA contractor for the TRICARE program since July 1, 1996. In August 2003, HMHS was awarded the contract to provide health benefits support and services to approximately 2.8 million active duty and retired military and their eligible family members in the ten state South Region. HMHS was also awarded the Department's contract to provide health care services and support for active duty service members and their families located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in February 2004.
                  Revenues associated with the contract and the earnings thereon are included in Humana's 2005 consolidated guidance.
