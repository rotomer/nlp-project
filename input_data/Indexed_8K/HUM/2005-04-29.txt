1Q05 pretax earnings up 18 percent
1Q05 EPS exceeds upper end of guided range
Medicare membership up 19 percent year to date
Commercial pretax margin increases 70 basis points
2005 EPS guidance raised
LOUISVILLE, KY (May 2, 2005) - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported $0.67 diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 (1Q05) compared to $0.41 EPS for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 (1Q04). First quarter results exceeded the upper end of company expectations primarily due to quicker than anticipated response to the company's new Medicare products and markets.
Pretax income rose 18 percent to $121.7 million in 1Q05 due to significant growth in Humana's Medicare programs and improved Commercial segment margins. After-tax income for 1Q05 included a $0.14 per share benefit from the realization of a federal income tax gain contingency.
 
"Our Medicare team continually optimizes the performance of this business through the application of industry-leading capabilities, strategic planning, and expertise built over 20 years as a successful CMS contractor," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "This quarter's results reflect senior consumers' early acceptance of both our new products and our entrance into new markets. Our 1Q05 results also reflect the continuation of our targeted shift to a mix of members in higher-margin individual, ASO, and consumer-choice products. More importantly, our progress this quarter positions Humana to achieve substantial earnings growth throughout 2005 and longer term."
The company now anticipates EPS for the year ending December 31, 2005 (FY 2005) of $2.23 to $2.25, up from the company's prior guidance of approximately $2.20 per share.
Commercial Segment Results
Commercial segment pretax earnings rose to $49.5 million in 1Q05 from $39.1 million in 1Q04, an increase of 27 percent, reflecting a more profitable business mix with significant increases in administrative services only (ASO), individual and consumer-choice product members. Pretax margin for the Commercial segment increased 70 basis points year over year to 2.9 percent in 1Q05.
,
The company continues to expect FY 2005 Commercial segment pretax earnings to increase between 10 and 15 percent over those for the year ended December 31, 2004 (FY 2004).
Commercial Segment Enrollment
Commercial segment medical membership of 3,219,400 at March 31, 2005 decreased 3 percent from December 31, 2004, driven by the January 1 relinquishment of an 89,000-member unprofitable account. The company's ASO and individual membership grew sequentially by 16 percent and 6 percent, respectively, as the company continued to improve the risk profile of its commercial book.
The company's leadership in product innovation continues to be shown through growth in its consumer-choice plans. At March 31, 2005, 12 percent of the company's commercial medical membership was in these plans, up from 9 percent at December 31, 2004.
Commercial Segment Premiums and Medical Costs
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial segment decreased 5 percent to $1.7 billion in 1Q05 compared to the prior year's quarter, driven by a 7 percent reduction in average organic membership for 1Q05 versus 1Q04 and a shift to a higher percentage of ASO business.
Commercial segment medical premiums for fully insured group membership increased approximately 8 percent on a per-member basis during 1Q05 compared to the same period in the prior year, including an approximately 50 basis point lowering effect from a higher mix of fully insured consumer-choice members. FY 2005 commercial premiums for fully insured group membership are projected to increase in the range of 8 to 10 percent on a per-member basis.
In 1Q05, the Commercial segment medical expense ratio (medical expenses divided by premium revenues) of 82.2 percent was 130 basis points lower than in 1Q04, reflecting thecompany's improving risk profile in its commercial portfolio.
Per-member medical costs for the commercial fully insured group business are forecast to rise in the range of 8 to 10 percent for FY 2005.
Government Segment Results
Government segment pretax earnings were $72.2 million in 1Q05 compared to $63.7 million in 1Q04, an increase of 13 percent, the result of significant growth in the company's Medicare membership along with an improved Medicare medical expense ratio.
For FY 2005, the company expects another year-over-year increase in earnings in its Government segment, driven by improvements in results from both Medicare and TRICARE operations.
Government Segment Enrollment
Organic growth in Medicare Advantage membership accelerated during 1Q05 due primarily to expanded participation in various Medicare programs combined withmarketing and other investment spending in these programs by the company. Medicare membership of 449,900 at March 31, 2005 increased 72,700 members or 19 percent from the December 31, 2004 level of 377,200, including 50,400 members acquired through the company's acquisition of CarePlus Health Plans of Florida in mid-February 2005.
Medicare Advantage membership is anticipated to experience continued growth throughout
FY 2005, with projected membership in the range of 480,000 to 500,000 by the end of the year.
As expected, TRICARE membership of 2,871,800 at March 31, 2005 was unchanged from December 31, 2004.
Government Segment Premiums and Medical Costs
Medicare Advantage premiums per member increased in the range of 10 to 12 percent year over year during 1Q05, including the partial-quarter impact of higher reimbursement associated with the acquired CarePlus membership.
For FY2005, the company anticipates Medicare per-member premiums to increase in the range of 11 to 13 percent. Medicare Advantage medical costs per member are projected to experience a corresponding increase of 11 to 13 percent for FY 2005.
TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees during 1Q05 of $574.0 million reflect the implementation of the new South Region contract with the Department of Defense, which included a reduction in the benefits and services provided under previous contracts, and thus, lower revenues. This accounted for the expected year-over-year decline in TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees of approximately 16 percent in 1Q05.
For 2005, the company anticipates TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees to approximate $2.5 billion as the company experiences a full year under the new South Region contract.
Selling, General & Administrative Expenses
The company's consolidated Selling, General, & Administrative (SG&A) expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) was 14.1 percent for 1Q05, a 30 basis point improvement versus the prior year. The Commercial segment's SG&A expense ratio was 17.6 percent in 1Q05 versus 16.4 percent in 1Q04, primarily the result of a higher percentage of ASO business in 1Q05. The Government segment's SG&A expense ratio for 1Q05 of 10.8 percent was 130 basis points lower than that for 1Q04, as higher Medicare and TRICARE revenues outpaced the increases in related SG&A expenses during the quarter.
The company's 2005 consolidated SG&A expense ratio is projected to be in the range of 13.5 to 14.5 percent. The expected lower SG&A expense ratio should result from the beneficial effect of both growth in membership and revenues leveraging fixed costs and management's continued focus on streamlining administrative costs through process design and technology adoption.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 1Q05 of $99.2 million were in line with the company's expectations, and compared favorably to $40.1 million cash flows used in operations in 1Q04. The substantial increase in cash flows resulted from a difference in the timing of the January CMS premium payment receipt for 2005 versus 2004. The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis, as described below.
The company anticipates that cash flows from operations for FY 2005 will be in the range of $625 million to $675 million driven by expected higher earnings.
Non-GAAP Cash Flows from Operations
The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable historical and projected cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), to the historical and projected non-GAAP financial measures. When reviewing and analyzing Humana's operating cash flows, company management applies the CMS premium payment in each month to match the corresponding disbursements. To do otherwise distorts meaningful analysis of the company's operating cash flow. Therefore, decisions such as management's forecasting and business plans regarding cash flow use this non-GAAP financial measure.
============== ================ =========
Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations during 1Q05 declined versus 1Q04 primarily as a result of the change in the company's commercial portfolio to a heavier mix of ASO customers on January 1, 2005 and the corresponding payment of runoff claims on fully-insured customers that either migrated to its ASO products or terminated their coverage with the company, including the large unprofitable, fully-insured account discussed during 2004.
Balance Sheet
At March 31, 2005, cash and investment securities comprised 49 percent of the company's total assets compared to 54 percent at December 31, 2004. Debt as a percent of total capitalization (debt plus stockholders' equity) increased to 28.7 percent from 23.3 percent at December 31, 2004. Changes in both of these metrics reflect the February 2005 closing of the accretive CarePlus transaction.
Acquisition of CarePlus
On February 16, 2005, the company completed its acquisition of CarePlus as well as its affiliated ten CAC-Florida Medical Centers, and PrescibIT Rx pharmacy company, adding 50,400 Medicare Advantage members in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.
