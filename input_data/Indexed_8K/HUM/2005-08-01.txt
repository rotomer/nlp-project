2005 earnings guidance reaffirmed
2006 EPS expected to grow at least 25 percent
Medicare membership up 5 percent sequentially, related guidance raised
Consolidated medical expense ratio improved 60 basis points versus 2Q04
1H05 cash flows from operations up significantly year over year
- Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported $0.51 diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 (2Q05) compared to $0.50 EPS for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 (2Q04). Results for 2Q05 were slightly better than the company anticipated due to higher-than-expected enrollment gains in the company's Medicare operations. (2Q04 EPS included $0.04 per share net benefit from unusual items.)
LOUISVILLE, KY (August 1, 2005)
"This quarter's results reflect the increasing momentum we are seeing in our Medicare operations, together with solid execution in our other diversified lines of business," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "Humana's dedication to the consumer, supported by both innovation and operational diligence, has us well positioned for future growth."
The company continues to anticipate EPS for the year ending December 31, 2005 (FY 2005) in the range of $2.23 to $2.25. The company also announced that it further anticipates growth in EPS of at least 25 percent for 2006, or $2.80 per share.
"Given the magnitude of our Medicare opportunity for 2006 and our thorough preparation to take advantage of it, we are comfortable with our ability to achieve the results we are forecasting today," McCallister said.
Consolidated Results Summary
2Q05 EPS of $0.51 compares to $0.50 for 2Q04. 2Q04 included a $0.04 per share unusual benefit, the net effect of a gain on the sale of a venture capital investment and unusual expenses for severance and other costs. The increase in operating earnings year over year was driven by improved performance in the company's Government segment.
First half 2005 (1H05) EPS of $1.18 rose 30 percent from $0.91 EPS in the first half of 2004 (1H04). Unusual items recorded in each of these periods increased 1H05 EPS by $0.14 per share and 1H04 EPS by $0.04 per share. Year-over-year operating improvements during 1H05 were also driven by results from the Government segment.
2Q05 consolidated revenues rose 3 percent to $3.55 billion from $3.43 billion in 2Q04, with total premium and administrative services fees up 4 percent compared to the prior year's quarter. Increases in Medicare premium revenues more than offset the enrollment-driven decline in Commercial segment revenues and lower TRICARE revenues year over year associated with the implementation of the South Region contract in the second half of 2004.
1H05 consolidated revenues of $6.93 billion increased 3 percent over 1H04 revenues of $6.72 billion, also driven by higher Government segment premiums. Continued growth in Medicare enrollment together with a more significant year-over-year increase in TRICARE revenues in the latter half of 2005 should result in forecasted revenue growth for FY 2005 of more than 10 percent.
The company's medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenue or MER) of 83.8 percent improved 60 basis points from 2Q04, with year over year MER declines in both of the company's business segments.
The company's consolidated Selling, General, & Administrative (SG&A) expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) was 13.9 percent for 2Q05, a 50 basis point improvement versus the prior year.
The company achieved a pretax margin of 3.6 percent in 2Q05, in line with that for 2Q04 despite a 30-basis-point benefit from unusual items in the prior year. The 1H05 pretax margin of 3.6 percent also compares favorably to 3.4 percent in 1H04, including the 20-basis-point-benefit from unusual items in 1H04.
The company continues to anticipate EPS for the second half of 2005 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.07. Third quarter 2005 EPS expectations reflect revised timing by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to complete their Medicare risk adjustment premium process, resulting in $0.16 EPS moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.
Government Segment Results Summary
Pretax earnings:
Government segment pretax income was $104.1 million in 2Q05 compared to $85.4 million in 2Q04, an increase of 22 percent, the result of significant growth in the company's Medicare membership combined with a slight improvement in the performance of the company's TRICARE operations year over year.
For 1H05, Government segment pretax income of $176.3 million increased 18 percent versus 1H04, with a significant increase in Medicare operations performance together with slightly improved results in the company's TRICARE business year over year.
Enrollment:
Organic growth in Medicare Advantage membership increased during 2Q05 due primarily to expanded participation in various Medicare programs and markets combined with marketing and other related spending in these programs by the company. Medicare membership of 474,300 at June 30, 2005 increased 24,400 members or 5 percent from 449,900 at March 31, 2005 and 106,400 members or 29 percent from June 30, 2004.
Medicare Advantage geographic expansions approved by CMS during 2Q05 are anticipated to contribute to continued enrollment growth, with projected membership in the range of 540,000 to 550,000 by the end of 2005.
As expected, TRICARE membership of 2,876,400 at June 30, 2005 was essentially unchanged from March 31, 2005. The company also anticipates no material change in TRICARE membership for the remainder of 2005.
Revenues:
Medicare Advantage premiums of $1.09 billion in 2Q05 increased 41 percent compared to $775 million in 2Q04, the result of substantially higher enrollment and increases in per-member premiums.
Medicare Advantage premiums per member increased 11 percent year over year during both 2Q05 and 1H05. Given the company's diligence in demonstrating the risk profile of its membership, premium yields are anticipated to increase in the latter half of 2005, with full-year per-member premiums projected to increase in the range of 11 to 13 percent.
TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees during 2Q05 of $624.8 million reflect the implementation of the new South Region contract with the Department of Defense, which included a reduction in the benefits and services provided under previous contracts, and thus, lower revenues. This contractual change accounted for the expected year-over-year decline in TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees of approximately 5 percent in 2Q05.
For 2005, the company anticipates TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees to approximate $2.5 billion as the company experiences a full year under the new South Region contract.
Government segment investment income for 2Q04 included $3.0 million related to the gain from the sale of a venture capital investment.
Government Segment Results Summary, continued
Medical Expenses:
The Government segment MER declined 40 basis points in 2Q05 compared to the prior year, driven by lower increases in Medicare medical costs per member.
Medicare Advantage medical costs per member are now anticipated to increase in the range of 9 to 11 percent for FY 2005 due to a lower percentage of the company's Medicare Advantage members being enrolled in capitated HMO plans.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government segment's SG&A expense ratio for 2Q05 of 10.6 percent was 170 basis points lower than that for 2Q04, as higher Medicare revenues outpaced the increases in the segment's SG&A expenses during the quarter. Results were similar for 1H05, with a 150 basis point decline in the Government segment's SG&A expense ratio.
Government segment SG&A expenses (both incurred to date and forecast for 2005) include the impact of significant investment spending to prepare for 2006 Medicare Advantage opportunities. Government segment SG&A expenses for 2Q04 included $1.5 million in severance and other unusual costs.
Commercial Segment Results Summary
Pretax earnings:
Commercial segment pretax income decreased to $25.2 million in 2Q05 from $36.9 million in 2Q04, or 32 percent. Results for 2Q04 included a $6.9 million net benefit from unusual items. Commercial segment earnings declined as the result of lower commercial medical membership in the 2 to 300 case-size accounts and a modest increase in the related medical expense ratio, both primarily resulting from the competitive price environment which had the largest impact for groups of this size.
Pretax margin for the Commercial segment decreased 50 basis points year over year to 1.5 percent in 2Q05 versus 2.0 percent in 2Q04. The unusual items recorded in 2Q04 increased the segment's pretax margin by 40 basis points. The 1H05 pretax margin for the segment of 2.2 percent was slightly improved from 2.1 percent for 1H04, despite the 20-basis-point benefit in 1H04 from the effect of unusual items.
Commercial segment earnings for FY 2005 are forecast to exceed FY 2004 earnings by 10 to 15 percent.
Enrollment:
Commercial segment medical membership of 3,199,700 at June 30, 2005 decreased less than 1 percent or 19,700 from March 31, 2005, driven by a decrease in fully-insured accounts.
The company's HumanaOne product demonstrated continuing progress during 2Q05, growing individual membership sequentially by 8 percent. Consumer-choice plan membership grew by 2 percent on a sequential basis, totaling 358,500 members at June 30, 2005. As expected, enrollment in administrative services only (ASO) products was relatively unchanged from the first quarter 2005 since this business generally renews at the beginning of the year.
Revenues:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial segment decreased 9 percent to $1.66 billion in 2Q05 compared to $1.83 billion in the prior year's quarter, as administrative services fees from an 18 percent increase in ASO membership were more than offset by lower premiums due to declines in at-risk enrollment.
Commercial segment premiums and administrative services fees for 1H05 decreased 7 percent to $3.32 billion versus $3.57 billion in 1H04, similarly impacted by substantial growth in ASO membership and reductions in at-risk commercial medical enrollment.
Commercial segment medical premiums for fully insured groups increased approximately 8 percent on a per-member basis during 2Q05. The company continues to anticipate FY 2005 commercial premiums for fully insured group membership to increase in the range of 8 to 10 percent on a per-member basis.
Commercial segment investment income for 2Q04 included $13.0 million related to the gain from the sale of the venture capital investment.
Commercial Segment Results Summary, continued
Medical Expenses:
In 2Q05, the Commercial segment MER of 83.8 percent was 80 basis points lower than the 2Q04 MER of 84.6 percent, reflecting the company's improving risk profile in its commercial portfolio. For 1H05, the Commercial segment MER of 83.0 percent decreased 110 basis points from 84.1 percent in 1H04, further reflecting the progress made in improving the risk of its commercial book of business.
Per-member medical costs for commercial fully insured group accounts continue to be forecast to rise in the range of 8 to 10 percent for FY 2005.
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial segment's SG&A expenses declined $5.0 million or 2 percent in 2Q05 compared to the prior year. Commercial segment SG&A expenses for 2Q04 included $6.1 million in severance and other unusual costs. The segment's SG&A expense ratio was 17.5 percent in 2Q05 versus 16.2 percent in 2Q04, the result of lower average fully-insured medical enrollment and a significantly higher percentage of ASO business in 2Q05 than in the prior year.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 2Q05 of $181.9 million compared favorably to $63.5 million cash flows provided by operations in 2Q04. Cash flows provided by operations for 1H05 of $281.1 million increased substantially from $24.9 million in 1H04 as a result of the timing of premium payments received from CMS. The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis, as described below.
The company continues to anticipate that cash flows from operations for FY 2005 will be in the range of $625 million to $675 million driven by expected higher earnings.
Non-GAAP Cash Flows from Operations
The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable historical and projected cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), to the historical and projected non-GAAP financial measures. When reviewing and analyzing Humana's operating cash flows, company management applies the CMS premium payment in each month to match the corresponding disbursements. To do otherwise distorts meaningful analysis of the company's operating cash flow. Therefore, decisions such as management's forecasting and business plans regarding cash flow use this non-GAAP financial measure.
                                                                             
      
      
       
       
              
Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations for 2Q05 and 2Q04 were the same as those determined under GAAP. The substantial increase in 1H05 non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations versus that for 1H04 is attributable to higher earnings year to date.
Balance Sheet
At June 30, 2005, cash and investment securities comprised 51 percent of the company's total assets compared to 49 percent at March 31, 2005. Debt as a percent of total capitalization (debt plus stockholders' equity) decreased 120 basis points to 27.5 percent from 28.7 percent at March 31, 2005 as the company paid down certain of its outstanding debt obligations during the quarter.
