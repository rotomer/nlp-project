Item 7.01   Regulation FD Disclosure
                 In meetings with investors and analysts between September 12, 2005 and September 30, 2005, Humana management will disclose that it was successful in bidding below each Regional benchmark for all of its Prescription Drug Plan bids submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on June 6, 2005.
                  Additionally, company management will be reaffirming its guidance for diluted earnings per common share of $2.23 to $2.25 for 2005 and at least $2.80 for 2006. These projections exclude any potential impact from Hurricane Katrina since the net financial impact associated with this event can not yet be determined.
                  The forward-looking statements contained herein are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be significantly impacted by certain risks and uncertainties described in the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and its Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005, as filed by Humana with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
