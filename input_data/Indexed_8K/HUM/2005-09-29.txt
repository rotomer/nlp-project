- Sept. 23, 2005 - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) announced today that it has received approval from The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to offer the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (PDP) to the more than 42 million Medicare eligible beneficiaries residing in 46 states and the District of Columbia, representing all of the states in which Humana applied. Humana had previously announced that it was successful in bidding below each regional benchmark for all of its Prescription Drug Plan bids submitted to CMS.
LOUISVILLE, Ky.
Starting Jan. 1, 2006, new Medicare prescription drug coverage will be available to everyone with Medicare. The Medicare Part D Benefit is designed to lower prescription drug costs and help protect against higher costs in the future. Enrollment, which is voluntary, occurs from Nov. 15, 2005, through May 15, 2006.
"This award represents an unprecedented opportunity for Humana to provide people with Medicare a broad selection of prescription drug coverage that meets their individual needs," said Stefen Brueckner, Humana's vice president for senior products. "The Medicare Part D prescription drug plan will provide access to affordable pharmaceutical care to Medicare beneficiaries. It is especially significant to the more than 12 million Medicare beneficiaries living in areas of the nation where access to affordable health care insurance may not have been available until now," he added.
Humana will offer Medicare prescription drug coverage through its Medicare Advantage HMO, PPO and private fee-for-service (PFFS) health plans, and as a stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP) to those enrolled in Original Medicare. As a result of the CMS award, Humana will now offer up to five Medicare products in many states. Humana currently offers Medicare Advantage HMO and PPO plans in more than 40 markets nationwide, and Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plans (PFFS) in more than thirty states.

- Sept. 23, 2005 - Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) announced today that it has received approval from The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to offer a regional PPO, a new type of Medicare Advantage health plan, in 23 states. This plan is a direct result of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, and will be offered by Humana to Medicare beneficiaries in 14 recently created Medicare Advantage regions.**
LOUISVILLE, Ky.
 
Beginning Jan. 1, 2006, more than 42 million Medicare eligible beneficiaries throughout the United States will have access to the Medicare Advantage regional preferred provider organization (MA-PPOs) health plans. These plans differ from Medicare Advantage HMOs in that there is no referral necessary to see a physician or specialist of choice. MA-PPOs also differ from Original Medicare in that they feature a prescription drug benefit and have been designed by CMS to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries living in all areas of the country have ready access to affordable, comprehensive health insurance.
Humana currently offers Medicare Advantage HMO and local PPO plans in more than 40 markets nationwide, and Medicare Advantage private fee for-service (PFFS) plans statewide in more than thirty states.
* See table on page 3 for listing of states where Humana's MA-PPOs are offered
"This award by CMS is significant in that it allows Humana to better meet the needs of people with Medicare who live in areas that have not previously had access to alternative Medicare plans," said Stefen Brueckner, Humana vice president of senior products. "Until recently, many Medicare beneficiaries residing in areas other than metropolitan hubs had little, if any, health care insurance plans to choose from other than Original Medicare or Medicare supplement (Medigap) plans."
Brueckner added, "Congress has taken a historical step in modernizing the Medicare program, and we are taking action to make healthcare coverage more affordable and accessible by expanding our product offerings into new markets. All 14 regions where Humana will offer the regional PPO will have two plan options that will include the prescription drug benefit. In some regions, a third PPO will have a zero premium but will not include the prescription drug benefit. Those options, coupled with membership in the SilverSneakers Fitness Program at no additional cost to our members makes this approach very attractive to Medicare beneficiaries around the country."
