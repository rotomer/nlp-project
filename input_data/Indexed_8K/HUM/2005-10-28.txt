2005 EPS guidance reaffirmed excluding litigation settlement and hurricane impact
Medicare membership surpasses 500,000
2006 EPS guidance reaffirmed
 
 
- Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported $0.30 in diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 (3Q05) compared to EPS of $0.52 for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 (3Q04). Results for 3Q05 include $0.27 per share in expenses resulting from the settlement of the company's multi-district class action litigation and $0.03 per share for expenses associated with Hurricane Katrina. Excluding these expenses, non-GAAP 3Q05 results of $0.60 per share increased 15 percent over the prior year's quarter.
LOUISVILLE, KY (October 31, 2005)
"Humana's third quarter produced robust expansion of our current Medicare membership with on-track performance in our higher-margin areas of commercial focus - ASO, individual and consumer plans," said Michael B. McCallister, president and chief executive officer of Humana. "The third quarter also produced significant progress in our preparations for the unprecedented Medicare opportunity in 2006 and 2007."
The company's previous EPS guidance for the year ending December 31, 2005 (FY05) of $2.23 to $2.25 has been updated to include expenses of $0.37 per share for the 3Q05 litigation settlement and costs associated with Hurricane Katrina during the second half of the year. Accordingly, the company now anticipates FY05 EPS in the range of $1.86 to $1.88.
The company continues to expect EPS for the year ending December 31, 2006 (FY06) of at least $2.70, which includes approximately $0.10 per share resulting from expensing stock options in connection with new accounting rules to be implemented on January 1, 2006. The company anticipates restating FY05 during 2006 to facilitate comparability for this accounting change. The estimated options expense restatement impact on FY05 EPS is expected to be approximately $0.08 per share.
Compared to our estimate of FY05 EPS of $1.86 to $1.88, this FY06 earnings guidance represents an increase in EPS in excess of 40 percent. Compared to our non-GAAP estimate of FY05 EPS of $2.09 to $2.11, and adjusting for the estimated $0.08 per share impact on FY05 for stock options accounting, this FY06 guidance represents an increase in non-GAAP EPS of over 30 percent.
This news release includes reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures on both a historical and projected basis as well as management's explanation for the use of non-GAAP financial metrics. See the "GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations" section within this news release.
 
Settlement of Class Action Litigation
On October 18, 2005, the company announced it had reached an agreement to settle a nationwide class action suit that has been pending in U.S. District Court in Miami for more than six years. The agreement has received preliminary approval from U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno, with final approval anticipated in the first quarter of 2006.
Pursuant to the settlement, Humana has agreed to pay $40 million to the plaintiffs. In addition, the company has agreed to pay up to $18 million in legal fees to be determined by the court. Humana's 3Q05 financial results include pretax expenses of $71.9 million ($44.8 million after tax or $0.27 per share) in connection with the settlement and other related litigation costs.
Hurricane Katrina
During the third quarter of 2005, certain of Humana's operations were affected by the impact of Hurricane Katrina. Given the unusually harsh circumstances associated with this storm, it is also anticipated to impact results for the fourth quarter of 2005. Expenses related to Hurricane Katrina primarily stem from the company's efforts, in close cooperation with Departments of Insurance in the affected states, to help our members by offering participating-provider benefits at non-participating providers, paying claims for members who are unable at this time to meet their premium obligations and similar measures.
The company recorded $6.7 million in pretax expenses ($4.2 million after taxes or $0.03 per share) in hurricane
-
related medical and administrative costs during 3Q05 and anticipates recording an additional approximately $20 million pretax (approximately $12.5 million after taxes or $0.07 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2005. Expenses related to Hurricane Katrina are not expected to significantly impact results for FY06.
Consolidated Results Summary
The Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in its summary of financial results below. See the "GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations" section of this news release.
EPS:
3Q05 EPS of $0.30 compares to $0.52 for 3Q04. Excluding the $0.30 in litigation and hurricane-related expenses during 3Q05, non-GAAP results for the quarter of $0.60 per share increased $0.08 or 15 percent, primarily driven by increases in Medicare membership and improved Medicare underwriting results.
3Q05 EPS varied from the company's prior expectations due to the receipt of Medicare risk adjustment payments originally anticipated during the fourth quarter and acceleration in the timing of Medicare investment spending.
EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 (YTD05) of $1.48 compares to $1.43 in EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 (YTD04). Excluding the expenses of $0.30 per share in litigation and hurricane expenses during 3Q05 and the $0.14 per share tax benefit from the realization of a gain contingency in the first quarter 2005, non-GAAP per share results of $1.64 per share increased $0.21 or 15 percent. Improved earnings from the company's Government Segment drove the increase.
The company now anticipates EPS for the quarter ending December 31, 2005 (4Q05) to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.40. Excluding anticipated expenses of approximately $0.07 per share related to Hurricane Katrina, the company's 4Q05 non-GAAP estimate would range from $0.45 to $0.47 per share. Additional factors affecting the updated EPS projection for 4Q05 include (1) a change in the timing between 3Q05 and 4Q05 for both the receipt of Medicare risk adjustment revenue and Medicare investment spending, (2) revised expectations for Commercial Segment performance, and (3) updated projections for Government Segment earnings.
Other components of earnings:
3Q05 consolidated revenues rose 20 percent to $3.82 billion from $3.18 billion in 3Q04, with total premium and administrative services fees also up 20 percent compared to the prior year's quarter.
YTD05 consolidated revenues were up 9 percent to $10.76 billion versus $9.89 billion for YTD04. Continued increases in membership in the company's higher-premium Medicare plans more than offset reduced revenues from its Commercial Segment membership.
Consolidated Results Summary, continued
The company's medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenue or MER) of 83.4 percent increased 70 basis points from an MER of 82.7 in 3Q04. Excluding the 20 basis point increase to the MER associated with the hurricane, the related consolidated non-GAAP ratio of 83.2 percent rose 50 basis points - the combined effect of an unusually low MER in 3Q04 associated with the TRICARE contract transition during that period and less favorable results for the Commercial Segment.
The company's consolidated selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees or SG&A expense ratio) increased to 16.2 percent for 3Q05 from 14.6 percent in 3Q04. Excluding litigation and hurricane expenses during 3Q05, the related non-GAAP ratio of 14.2 percent declined 40 basis points from 3Q04 as operational leverage from higher Medicare membership more than offset expenses during 3Q05 to prepare for 2006 Medicare opportunities.
Government Segment Results Summary
The Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in its summary of pretax financial results below. See the "GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations" section of this news release.
Pretax results:
Government Segment pretax earnings were $89.5 million in 3Q05 compared to $88.8 million in 3Q04. Excluding $34.9 million of litigation and hurricane expenses in 3Q05, non-GAAP pretax income for the segment of $124.4 million improved year over year by $35.6 million or 40 percent as a result of higher Medicare membership and the resulting operational leverage.
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership reached 503,100 at September 30, 2005, an increase of 131,800 (35 percent) from September 30, 2004 and 28,800 (6 percent) from June 30, 2005. The company's expanded participation in various Medicare programs and markets during the quarter combined with the company's increased marketing efforts for these programs led to the higher membership level.
Medicare Advantage geographic expansions are anticipated to continue to contribute to organic enrollment growth, with projected membership in the range of 540,000 to 550,000 by the end of FY05.
As expected, TRICARE membership of 2,874,400 at September 30, 2005 was essentially unchanged from June 30, 2005. The company also anticipates no material change in TRICARE membership for the remainder of 2005.
Revenues:
Medicare Advantage premiums of $1.30 billion in 3Q05 increased 59 percent compared to $814.6 million in 3Q04, the result of substantially higher enrollment and increases in per-member premiums.
Medicare Advantage premiums per member increased 20 percent year over year during 3Q05 due primarily to higher per-member standard reimbursement rates from the government, the company's diligence in demonstrating the risk profile of its membership and the acquisition of CarePlus Health Plans of Florida in February 2005. Per-member premiums for FY05 are now projected to increase in the range of 12 to 14 percent.
TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees during 3Q05 of $667.8 million reflect a full quarter under the South Region contract. Related revenues for the prior year's quarter of $405.0 million reflected the contract transition taking effect during that period.
For 2005, the company anticipates TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees to approximate $2.5 billion as the company experiences a full year under the new South Region contract.
Government Segment Results Summary, continued
Medical Expenses:
The Government Segment MER increased 90 basis points to 82.5 percent in 3Q05 compared to 81.6 percent in the prior year's quarter, driven by an unusually low MER in 3Q04 associated with TRICARE contract transition timing.
Medicare Advantage medical costs per member continue to be expected to increase in the range of 9 to 11 percent for FY05.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segment's SG&A expense ratio for 3Q05 of 13.2 percent was 70 basis points higher than that for 3Q04 of 12.5 percent. Excluding expenses related to the litigation settlement and Hurricane Katrina, the related non-GAAP ratio of 11.5 percent declined 100 basis points, as planned expenses to prepare for 2006 Medicare opportunities were more than offset by operational leverage associated with higher Medicare membership.
Commercial Segment Results Summary
The Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in its summary of pretax financial results below. See the "GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations" section of this news release.
Pretax results:
Results for the Commercial Segment during 3Q05 reflect a pretax loss of $18.1 million compared to pretax income of $38.7 million in 3Q04. Excluding $43.7 million of litigation and hurricane expenses in 3Q05, non-GAAP pretax income for the segment of $25.6 million declined $13.1 million compared to 3Q04. Commercial segment operating earnings were negatively affected year over year by continued medical membership attrition driven by the pricing environment in the 2 to 300 case-size accounts and an increase in the segment's MER.
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership of 3,177,900 at September 30, 2005 decreased approximately 1 percent or 21,800 from June 30, 2005, driven by a decrease in fully-insured accounts.
The company's HumanaOne product demonstrated continued growth during 3Q05, increasing individual medical membership by 6 percent sequentially with a year-to-date growth rate of 21 percent. As expected, September 30, 2005 ASO membership of 1,170,500 and consumer-choice membership of 350,600 were essentially unchanged from June 30, 2005. On a year-to-date basis, ASO membership grew 15 percent while consumer-choice membership increased 43 percent.
Revenues:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment decreased 7 percent to $1.67 billion in 3Q05 compared to $1.79 billion in the prior year's quarter, as an increase in administrative services fees resulting from a 15 percent increase in ASO membership were more than offset by lower premiums due to declines in at-risk enrollment.
Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully insured groups increased approximately 7 percent on a per-member basis during 3Q05. The company anticipates FY05 commercial premiums for fully insured group membership to increase in the range of 7 to 9 percent on a per-member basis.
Medical Expenses:
In 3Q05, the Commercial Segment MER of 84.4 percent was 80 basis points higher than the 3Q04 MER of 83.6 percent. Excluding the 30 basis point increase in the MER from Hurricane Katrina, the related non-GAAP ratio of 84.1 percent rose 50 basis points reflecting higher inpatient utilization trends in its commercial portfolio.
Per-member medical costs for commercial fully insured group accounts are now forecasted to rise in the range of 7 to 9 percent for FY05.
Commercial Segment Results Summary, continued
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio of 20.0 percent for 3Q05 compares to 16.3 percent in 3Q04. Excluding litigation and hurricane-related expenses, the related non-GAAP ratio of 17.7 percent increased 140 basis points, the result of lower average fully-insured medical enrollment and a significantly higher percentage of ASO business in 3Q05 than in the prior year.
 
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 3Q05 of $591.0 million compared to $303.5 million cash flows provided by operations in 3Q04. The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis, as described in the "GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations" section of this news release.
Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations declined to $206.3 million in 3Q05 from $303.5 million in 3Q04 due to the collection of substantial TRICARE bid price adjustment receivables in 3Q04.
The company continues to anticipate that cash flows from operations for FY05 will be in the range of $625 million to $675 million driven by expected higher earnings.
Balance Sheet
At September 30, 2005, cash and investment securities comprised 52 percent of the company's total assets compared to 51 percent at June 30, 2005. Debt as a percent of total capitalization (debt plus stockholders' equity) decreased 670 basis points to 20.8 percent from 27.5 percent at June 30, 2005 as the company paid down certain of its outstanding debt obligations during the quarter.
