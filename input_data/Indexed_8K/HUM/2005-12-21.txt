Item 1.01    Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
                   At the December 15, 2005 meeting of the Company's Organization & Compensation Committee and Board of Directors, the following items were approved:
                   a)    2006 Management Incentive Compensation Measurements and Targets.
For the Chief Executive Officer, the sole measurement will be attainment of an Earnings Per Share (EPS) target for 2006.
For the other executive officers, the measurements will consist of 80% EPS, 10% membership goals and 10% attainment of specific strategic initiatives.
Consistent with 2005, the target annual incentive awards for the executive officers will generally be in the range of 100% to 150% of base salary, with a maximum potential payment in the rate of 150% to 175%. The actual awards will reflect adjustments to those targets based on Company and individual performance.
                    b)    Increase in Base Salaries for the Named Executive Officers.
An increase in the base salary for the Company's Named Executive Officers (as defined in Regulation S-K item 402(a)(3)), with the following base salaries for 2006, effective December 25, 2005:
                    c)    Establishment of a Financial Planning Program for eight executive officers.
                    The Company will provide a financial planning program for eight executive officers under which each may engage a third party to provide financial planning services and receive reimbursement from the Company of up to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) annually.
 
 
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
