2005 consolidated revenues of $14.4 billion
4Q05 EPS up 34 percent
2005 cash flows from operations of more than $625 million
Medical membership of 7.1 million at December 31, 2005
 
- Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported $0.39 in diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 (4Q05) compared to EPS of $0.29 for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 (4Q04), an increase of 34 percent.
LOUISVILLE, KY (February 6, 2006)
For the year ended December 31, 2005 (FY05), the company reported EPS of $1.87 versus $1.72 for the year ended December 31, 2004 (FY04), an increase of 9 percent.
"Humana achieved record levels of revenues, net income and membership in 2005, as our Medicare business grew significantly and our Commercial profits improved," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "But the real story of 2005 was our successful preparation for unprecedented Medicare expansion in 2006 and beyond. We are now superbly positioned to take advantage of this multi-year growth opportunity."
The company also evaluates its earnings performance on a non-GAAP basis. See management's explanation under item (a) of the "Footnotes" section of this news release. Below is a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results for 4Q05 and FY05. There were no non-GAAP reconciling items for 4Q04 or FY04.
 
 
The company now expects EPS for the year ending December 31, 2006 (FY06) of at least $2.81, including expenses of $0.10 per share resulting from new stock option accounting rules implemented on January 1, 2006. Below is an analysis of the company's projected earnings for FY06 on a non-GAAP basis, as well as the anticipated stock options comparability restatement for FY05.
Increases in Medicare membership and improved Government Segment underwriting results combined with improved Commercial Segment earnings drove the year-over-year increases in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS during 4Q05 and FY05.
Revenues - 4Q05 consolidated revenues rose 14 percent to $3.66 billion from $3.21 billion in 4Q04, with total premium and administrative services fees also up 14 percent compared to the prior year's quarter. FY05 consolidated revenues were up 10 percent to $14.42 billion versus $13.10 billion for FY04. Continued increases in membership in the company's higher-premium Medicare plans more than offset reduced revenues from its Commercial Segment membership on a year-over-year basis for both the quarter and the full year.
Medical costs - the company's medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenue or MER) of 82.1 percent in 4Q05 decreased 260 basis points from an MER of 84.7 in 4Q04. Excluding the 60 basis point increase to the MER associated with the hurricane, the related consolidated non-GAAP ratio of 81.5 percent declined 320 basis points with improvements in both the Government and Commercial Segment MERs.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses - the company's consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees or SG&A expense ratio) increased to 16.7 percent for 4Q05 from 14.5 percent in 4Q04, the result of significant Medicare investment spending during 4Q05 to prepare for 2006 Medicare opportunities.
Government Segment Results Summary
 
 
 
Pretax results:
Government Segment pretax earnings were $57.4 million in 4Q05 compared to $35.9 million in 4Q04. Non-GAAP pretax income for the segment of $61.8 million improved year over year by $25.9 million or 72 percent, the result of higher Medicare membership and the related operational leverage during 4Q05 as well as improved TRICARE earnings performance.
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership rose to 557,800 at December 31, 2005, an increase of 180,600 (48 percent) from December 31, 2004 and 54,700 (11 percent) from September 30, 2005. The company's expanded participation in various Medicare programs and markets during the quarter combined with the company's increased marketing efforts for these programs led to the higher membership level.
The company continues to expect Medicare Advantage geographic expansions to contribute to organic enrollment growth primarily during the first six months of 2006, with projected Medicare Advantage membership in the range of 900,000 to 1.1 million by the end of FY06. Membership in the company's stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) are anticipated to approximate 1.9 million to 2.2 million members by the end of 2006 with enrollment also primarily occurring during the first half of 2006.
As expected, TRICARE membership of 2,889,100 at December 31, 2005 was essentially unchanged from September 30, 2005. The company also anticipates no material change in TRICARE membership during FY06.
Revenues:
Medicare Advantage premiums of $1.22 billion in 4Q05 increased 54 percent compared to $791.1 million in 4Q04, the result of substantially higher enrollment and increases in per-member premiums.
Medicare Advantage premiums per member increased 7 percent year over year during 4Q05 due primarily to higher per-member standard reimbursement rates from the government, the company's effectiveness in demonstrating the risk profile of its membership and the acquisition of CarePlus Health Plans of Florida in February 2005.
TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees during 4Q05 of $585.3 million compare to $486.9 million in 4Q04. The year-over-year increase reflects a higher negotiated premium for the second option period as well as a full complement of membership under the new contract for the full quarter in 2005.
Medical Expenses:
The Government Segment MER decreased 440 basis points to 81.3 percent in 4Q05 compared to 85.7 percent in the prior year's quarter, with improvements in the MERs for each of the lines of business within this segment. Excluding the 20 basis point increase in the MER from Hurricane Katrina, the related non-GAAP ratio of 81.1 percent declined 460 basis points reflecting lower inpatient utilization trends in its government portfolio.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segment's SG&A expense ratio for 4Q05 of 15.5 percent was 360 basis points higher than that for 4Q04 of 11.9 percent driven by expenses associated with the 2006 Medicare opportunity incurred during 4Q05.
Commercial Segment Results Summary
 
 
Pretax results:
Results for the Commercial Segment during 4Q05 reflect pretax income of $41.8 million compared to $27.3 million in 4Q04. Non-GAAP pretax income for the segment of $57.7 million increased $30.4 million compared to 4Q04. Commercial Segment operating earnings in 4Q05 reflect improvements in utilization trends experienced primarily during the second half of 2005.
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership of 3,170,800 at December 31, 2005 decreased approximately 4 percent or 134,300 from the prior year end, driven by a decrease in fully-insured accounts.
The company's HumanaOne product demonstrated continued growth during 4Q05, increasing individual medical membership by 3 percent sequentially with a year-to-date growth rate of 25 percent. ASO membership of 1,171,000 and consumer-choice membership of 371,100 at December 31, 2005 reflect the company's expanded presence in each of these sectors. ASO membership grew 15 percent during FY05 while consumer choice membership grew 52 percent during the same period.
Revenues:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment decreased 5 percent to $1.67 billion in 4Q05 compared to $1.77 billion in the prior year's quarter, as an increase in administrative services fees resulting from a 15 percent increase in ASO membership were more than offset by lower premiums due to declines in at-risk enrollment.
Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully insured groups increased approximately 8 percent on a per-member basis during 4Q05 compared to 4Q04. The company anticipates FY06 commercial premiums for fully insured group membership to increase at least equal to the expected rise in per-member medical costs.
 
Medical Expenses:
In 4Q05, the Commercial Segment MER of 82.9 percent was 100 basis points lower than the 4Q04 MER of 83.9 percent. Excluding the 100 basis point increase in the MER from Hurricane Katrina, the related non-GAAP ratio of 81.9 percent declined 200 basis points reflecting lower inpatient utilization trends in its commercial portfolio.
Per-member medical costs for commercial fully insured group accounts are forecasted to rise in the range of 7 to 9 percent for FY06.
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio of 18.1 percent for 4Q05 compares to 16.6 percent in 4Q04, the result of lower average fully-insured medical enrollment and an increase in the percentage of ASO commercial membership to 37 percent in 4Q05 versus 31 percent in the prior year.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows used in operations for 4Q05 of $246.5 million compared to $19.5 million cash flows provided by operations in 4Q04. The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis, as described in footnote (g) of the "Footnotes" section of this news release.
 
Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations increased to $138.3 million in 4Q05 from $19.5 million in 4Q04 driven by improved operating performance in 4Q05 and the negative impact upon cash flows of the final phase of the TRICARE contract transition in 4Q04.
The company now anticipates that cash flows from operations for FY06 will be in the range of $750 million to $850 million driven by expected higher earnings.
Balance Sheet
At December 31, 2005, cash and investment securities comprised 51 percent of the company's total assets compared to 52 percent at September 30, 2005. Debt as a percent of total capitalization (debt plus stockholders' equity) increased 400 basis points to 24.8 percent from 20.8 percent at September 30, 2005 as the company increased its borrowings during 4Q05 primarily in anticipation of funding additional capital into certain subsidiaries during FY06 in conjunction with anticipated growth in revenues.
Cash and investments at the parent company at December 31, 2005 of $419.6 million compared to $439.3 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting the company's use of parent company cash for acquisition activity during FY05.
 
Footnotes
The Company has included certain financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in its summary of financial results and earnings projections within this news release. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
During the latter half of 2005, certain of Humana's operations were affected by the unusually harsh impact of Hurricane Katrina. Expenses related to Hurricane Katrina primarily stem from the company's efforts, in close cooperation with Departments of Insurance in the affected states, to help our members by offering participating-provider benefits at non-participating providers, paying claims for members who were unable at that time to meet their premium obligations and similar measures. Expenses related to Hurricane Katrina are not expected to have a material impact upon the company's results for FY06.
On October 18, 2005, the company announced it had reached an agreement to settle a nationwide class action suit that has been pending in U.S. District Court in Miami for more than six years. The agreement has received preliminary court approval with final approval anticipated in 1Q06.
In the first quarter of 2005 the company realized a federal income tax benefit from a contingency item that was resolved in February 2005.
On January 1, 2006, the company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" using the retrospective transition model outlined therein. Thus, the company anticipates restating its FY05 results during FY06 to allow for comparability.
During 1Q06 the company realized a gain on the sale of an investment totaling approximately $52 million (pretax) or $0.20 in EPS, which is $34 million (pretax) or $0.13 per share higher than the capital gains assumed in the company's 2006 non-GAAP EPS guidance of at least $2.70, and $34 million (pretax) higher than the capital gains realized in 2005. The company, in turn, donated $0.02 per share of the excess gains to the Humana Foundation.
When reviewing and analyzing Humana's operating cash flows, company management applies the CMS premium payment in each month to match the corresponding disbursements. To do otherwise distorts meaningful analysis of the company's operating cash flow. Therefore, decisions such as management's forecasting and business plans regarding cash flow use this non-GAAP financial measure.
