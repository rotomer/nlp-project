2006 EPS outlook raised to $2.82 to $2.88
Consolidated revenues increase $1.32 billion, or 39 percent year over year
Medical membership up 32 percent year over year and 31 percent sequentially
New Medicare PDP business impacts quarterly earnings pattern
GAAP cash flows from operations of $1.01 billion
Non-GAAP cash flows from operations of $233.3 million
 
- Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported $0.50 in diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 (1Q06), within the range of the company's guidance for 1Q06 EPS of $0.50 to $0.55. As expected, the change in the quarterly pattern of 2006 earnings resulting from the introduction of the company's stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs), combined with higher Medicare sales, marketing, and service infrastructure costs versus a year ago, resulted in a year-over-year decline in 1Q06 EPS, while driving an increase in Medicare revenues of over $1.25 billion, or 127 percent. EPS for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 (1Q05) of $0.65 was $0.15 higher than 1Q06 EPS.
LOUISVILLE, KY (May 1, 2006)
(a)
The company estimates EPS for the year ending December 31, 2006 (FY06E) will be in the range of $2.82 to $2.88 versus $1.79 for the year ended December 31, 2005 (FY05), a growth rate of approximately 60 percent.
(a)
"This is a transformative year for Humana, and we're on track to achieve the objectives that will produce 2006 growth in both earnings and revenues of more than 50 percent," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "Better-than-expected Medicare membership growth and good progress in our Commercial business during the first quarter has led us to raise our guidance this morning for full-year earnings per share. By maximizing this year's opportunities, we're also establishing a strong foundation for robust growth in 2007 and beyond."
The company also evaluates its earnings performance on a non-GAAP basis. See management's explanation under item (b) of the "Footnotes" section of this news release. Below is a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results for 1Q06 and FY06E.
 
- 1Q06 consolidated revenues rose 39 percent to $4.70 billion from $3.39 billion in 1Q05, with total premium and administrative services fees up 37 percent compared to the prior year's quarter. These substantial increases are primarily the result of significantly higher enrollment in the company's Medicare Advantage plans and the implementation of stand-alone PDPs for Medicare beneficiaries on January 1, 2006.
Revenues
- The company's medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenue or MER) of 83.7 percent in 1Q06 was unchanged from that for 1Q05 as significant year-over-year improvement in this metric for the Commercial Segment was offset by a higher Government Segment MER. The higher MER in the Government Segment results from the inclusion of stand-alone PDP results in the current period.
Medical costs
- As expected, the company's consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees or SG&A expense ratio) increased to 16.1 percent for 1Q06 from 14.3 percent in 1Q05 due to the increase in SG&A expenses associated with the Medicare expansion coupled with a substantial increase in the percentage of Commercial medical members in ASO accounts. The increase in SG&A related to Medicare results from the build out of infrastructure and support functions in advance of the anticipated escalation in enrollment and from sales and marketing costs associated with the more concentrated 2006 Medicare selling season.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
(a)
- Effective May 1, 2006, the company completed its acquisition of CHA Health, a Kentucky-based health plan, adding approximately 92,500 Commercial medical members for cash consideration of approximately $65.0 million.
Acquisition
Government Segment Results Summary
Pretax results:
Government Segment pretax earnings were $21.6 million in 1Q06 compared to $70.5 million in 1Q05. This decline was anticipated as the company's Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings change its quarterly pattern of earnings for 2006.
(a)
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership rose to 741,200 at March 31, 2006, an increase of 291,300 (65 percent) from March 31, 2005 and 183,400 (33 percent) from December 31, 2005. The company's expanded participation in various Medicare programs and markets combined with the company's increased sales and marketing efforts for these programs led to the higher membership level.
Membership in the company's Medicare Advantage plans continued to rise in the second quarter and approximated 800,000 in April 2006 with May 2006 expected to approximate 860,000 upon completion of the standard monthly enrollment reconciliations with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The company continues to expect Medicare Advantage membership in the range of 900,000 to 1.1 million by December 31, 2006.
Membership in the company's stand-alone PDPs totaled 1,959,000 at March 31, 2006. PDP sales momentum continues to be strong with April 2006 membership of approximately 2.2 million and May 2006 expected to approximate 2.6 million. The company now anticipates PDP membership in the range of 2.7 million to 2.9 million by the end of 2006.
As expected, TRICARE membership of 2,874,000 at March 31, 2006 was essentially unchanged from December 31, 2005. The company also anticipates no material change in TRICARE membership during 2006.
Medicaid membership of 427,000 at March 31, 2006 declined 50,200 from March 31, 2005 and 30,900 from December 31, 2005 due to the non-renewal of the Illinois Medicaid contract in the third quarter of 2005 and a shift of eligible Puerto Rico Medicaid members to the Medicare program.
Revenues:
Medicare Advantage premiums of $1.72 billion in 1Q06 increased 75 percent compared to $983.1 million in 1Q05, the result of substantially higher enrollment, increases in per-member premiums, and the impact of changes in the geographic mix of the related membership. Medicare Advantage premiums per member increased 6 percent year over year during 1Q06.
Medicare PDP premiums added $515.2 million in new revenues in 1Q06.
TRICARE premiums and administrative services fees during 1Q06 of $611.9 million compare to $575.7 million in 1Q05. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects a higher premium for the second option period which began April 1, 2005.
Investment income for the quarter included a capital gain of approximately $6.4 million associated with the sale of a venture capital investment.
Medical Expenses:
The Government Segment MER increased 50 basis points to 85.6 percent in 1Q06 compared to 85.1 percent in the prior year's quarter. The increase is primarily the result of the establishment of the stand-alone PDPs in January 2006 (MER of 96.4 percent in 1Q06) partially offset by improvement in the MER for Medicare Advantage plans year over year during 1Q06.
The MER for stand-alone PDP offerings over each of the interim reporting periods is impacted by the recognition of benefit costs as incurred under each plan's provisions. Different PDP designs offered by the company result in varying levels of coverage through each of the different layers of beneficiary cost responsibility as specified under the Standard PDP, as defined by statute. The company anticipates an MER for the full year for its stand-alone PDPs in the range of 85 percent to 88 percent, with MER improvement expected in each sequential quarter throughout the year. Variables that may impact the quarterly MER for the stand-alone PDPs include: (1) the timing of member enrollment, (2) the PDP offering chosen by the member, and (3) the speed with which members move through their deductibles.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segment's SG&A expense ratio for 1Q06 of 13.8 percent was 290 basis points higher than that for 1Q05 of 10.9 percent driven by expenses associated with the infrastructure build out of the company's expanded Medicare offerings. In particular, marketing expenses and service costs per member were significantly higher year over year. The company anticipates that its SG&A expense ratio will improve as marketing expenses decline substantially during the Medicare Advantage lock-in period beginning July 1, 2006 and the average membership associated with the Medicare expansion increases throughout the year, providing more leverage against administrative costs.
(a)
Commercial Segment Results Summary
 
Pretax results:
Results for the Commercial Segment during 1Q06 reflect pretax income of $109.6 million compared to $46.2 million in 1Q05. Non-GAAP pretax income for the segment of $82.4 million increased $36.2 million compared to 1Q05. Commercial Segment operating earnings in 1Q06 reflect year-over-year improvements in utilization trends and the timing of the benefit of capital gains.
(a)
The company now projects 2006 pretax earnings in its Commercial Segment of between $180 million and $220 million, driven by improving medical costs trends combined with disciplined pricing.
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership of 3,259,400 at March 31, 2006 increased approximately 40,000 (1 percent) from March 31, 2005 and 88,600 (3 percent) from December 31, 2005. The sequential increase in Commercial Segment medical membership was attributable to higher administrative services only (ASO) membership partially offset by a decline in fully insured group membership.
ASO medical membership of 1,395,200 at March 31, 2006 accounted for approximately 43 percent of the company's Commercial medical membership, a growth rate in enrollment of 18 percent year over year and 19 percent since December 31, 2005.
Membership in the company's Smart plans and other consumer offerings increased to 421,200 at March 31, 2006, representing approximately 13 percent of Commercial medical membership compared to 12 percent at March 31, 2005.
Revenues:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment decreased 2 percent to $1.62 billion in 1Q06 compared to $1.66 billion in the prior year's quarter, as an increase in administrative services fees resulting from an 18 percent increase in ASO membership was more than offset by lower premiums due to declines in at-risk enrollment.
Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully insured groups increased approximately 7 percent on a per-member basis during 1Q06 compared to 1Q05. This increase includes the effect of a greater percentage of the company's fully-insured group block being weighted towards small groups, as its large group business becomes more weighted towards ASO. Premium yield and medical cost trends for small group business currently include a higher level of benefit buydowns versus larger employers. The company anticipates FY06 commercial premiums for fully insured group membership to increase at least equal to the expected rise in per-member medical costs.
As disclosed in the company's fourth quarter 2005 earnings press release, investment income for 1Q06 included a capital gain of approximately $45.3 million associated with the sale of a venture capital investment. The company has historically recorded substantial capital gains from such investments each year, though the timing has not been historically consistent as to the quarters in which such gains occur.
Medical Expenses:
In 1Q06, the Commercial Segment MER of 80.1 percent was 210 basis points lower than the 1Q05 MER of 82.2 percent, reflecting improving medical cost utilization trends and an improving customer risk profile.
Per-member medical costs for commercial fully insured group accounts are now forecasted to rise in the range of 6 to 7 percent during 2006, including the effect of a greater percentage of our fully-insured groups being weighted towards small employers, as discussed above. Commercial group "same store" medical cost trends are now expected to be approximately 50 to 75 basis points lower than the company's previous forecast.
Individual components of Commercial medical cost trend for 2006 are anticipated to approximate as follows: inpatient hospital utilization - flat to 1 percent; inpatient and outpatient hospital rates - upper single digits; outpatient hospital utilization - low to mid single digits; physician - mid single digits; and pharmacy - high single digits to low double digits.
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio of 20.4 percent for 1Q06 compares to 17.8 percent in 1Q05, the result of lower average fully-insured medical enrollment and an increase in the percentage of commercial medical membership related to ASO to 43 percent in 1Q06 versus 37 percent in the prior year.
(a)
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 1Q06 of $1.01 billion compared to $95.6 million in 1Q05. The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis, as described in footnote (d) of the "Footnotes" section of this news release.
(a)
 
Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations increased to $233.3 million in 1Q06 from $115.4 million in 1Q05 driven by growth in the company's Medicare operations. The company continues to expect that cash flows from operations for 2006 will be in the range of $750 million to $850 million driven by expected higher earnings.
(a)
Footnotes
In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Humana adopted the retrospective method for implementing new stock option accounting rules on January 1, 2006. Consequently, prior period results in this news release reflect the restatement for the expensing of stock options.
The Company has included certain financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP in its summary of financial results and earnings projections within this news release. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
During 1Q06 the company realized a gain on the sale of an investment totaling approximately $52 million (pretax) or $0.19 in EPS, which is $34 million (pretax) or $0.13 per share higher than the capital gains assumed in the company's 2006 non-GAAP EPS guidance and $34 million (pretax) higher than the capital gains realized in 2005. The company, in turn, donated $0.02 per share of the excess gains to the Humana Foundation.
When reviewing and analyzing Humana's operating cash flows, company management applies the CMS premium payment in each month to match the corresponding disbursements. To do otherwise distorts meaningful analysis of the company's operating cash flow. Therefore, decisions such as management's forecasting and business plans regarding cash flow use this non-GAAP financial measure.
Computed by comparing 1Q06 non-GAAP EPS to 1Q05 non-GAAP EPS of $0.51. 1Q05 GAAP EPS of $0.65 included the realization of a tax gain contingency of $0.14 per share.
Computed by comparing FY06E non-GAAP EPS to FY05 non-GAAP EPS of $2.02. FY05 GAAP EPS of $1.79 included expenses associated with a class action litigation settlement of $0.27 per share, expenses related to Hurricane Katrina of $0.10 per share, and the benefit from the realization of a tax gain contingency of $0.14 per share.
