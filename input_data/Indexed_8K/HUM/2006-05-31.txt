The terms of other series of Securities issued under the Base Indenture may vary with respect to interest rates or interest rate formulas, issue dates, maturity, redemption, repayment, currency of payment and otherwise as provided in the Base Indenture. The Base Indenture further provides that Securities of a single series may be issued at various times, with different maturity dates and may bear interest at different rates. All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture, with respect to the Company) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series then Outstanding may declare the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest thereon shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.

This Note may be redeemed at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at the option of the Company (such date of redemption, the "Optional Redemption Date") at the
4
Redemption Price (as defined below) together with interest accrued thereon to the Optional Redemption Date.
The "Redemption Price" shall equal to the greater of:
                 
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and
                 
the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the Notes to be redeemed consisting of principal and interest, exclusive of interest accrued to the Optional Redemption Date, discounted to the Optional Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Yield plus 30 basis points plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.
The Notes called for redemption become due on the Optional Redemption Date. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Optional Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Notes will state the amount to be redeemed. On and after the Optional Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on any Notes that are redeemed.

For purposes of determining the Redemption Price, the following definitions are applicable:
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining terms of the Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date:
the average of the bid and the asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, at 4:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding that Optional Redemption Date, as set forth on "Telerate Page 500," or such other page as may replace Telerate Page 500; or
if Telerate Page 500, or any successor page, is not displayed or does not contain bid and/or asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue at that time, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Company for that Optional Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or, if the Company is unable to obtain at least four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Company.
5
"Independent Investment Banker" means either Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, as selected by the Company or, if both such firms are unwilling or unable to select the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and its successors and four other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer") selected by the Independent Investment Banker; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Optional Redemption Date for the Notes, an average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue for the Notes, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Trustee by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Optional Redemption Date.
"Treasury Yield" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity, computed as of the third business day immediately preceding the Optional Redemption Date, of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, equal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for the Optional Redemption Date.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of that series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series, except a default in the payment of principal of or

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provisions of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
