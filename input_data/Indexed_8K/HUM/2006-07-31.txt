LOUISVILLE, KY (July 31, 2006)
- Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) today reported $0.53 in diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 (2Q06), $0.19 per share higher than the mid-point of the companys prior guidance. On a year-over-year basis, the 2Q06 EPS is 8 percent higher than the companys EPS for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 (2Q05) of $0.49
(a)
. The upside in the quarter was a combination of better-than-expected performance in the companys Medicare Advantage, commercial and TRICARE business lines, partially offset by profit margins in its Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) moving to the low end of the projected range.
The company continues to estimate EPS for the year ending December 31, 2006 (FY06E) in the range of $2.82 to $2.88 versus $1.79
(a)
for the year ended December 31, 2005 (FY05), a growth rate of approximately 60 percent. In addition to the impact of changes associated with second quarter performance, this forecast has been revised to reflect managements updated expectations for Medicare marketing costs in the latter half of 2006. In order to maximize 2007 Medicare growth opportunities, the company now anticipates its second-half 2006 Medicare marketing costs to be approximately $0.15 per share higher than it had previously forecast.
 
Strong results in our Medicare Advantage, Commercial and TRICARE businesses combined to produce second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed our expectations, said Michael B. McCallister, Humanas president and chief executive officer. Were on track to grow revenues by 50 percent this year as we enhance our reputation as the consumer leader in health benefits and expand our Medicare business into a long-term growth engine.
 
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2006 (1H06) the company reported $1.03 in EPS compared to $1.14
(a)
for the six months ended June 30, 2005 (1H05). The year-over-year decline in year-to-date results was expected given the change in the quarterly pattern of 2006 earnings primarily driven by the introduction of the companys stand-alone Medicare PDPs in January 2006. Higher Medicare administrative costs in 1H06 versus 1H05 also contributed to the decline in earnings from the 2005 period. Given these factors, earnings are expected to increase in the second half of the year compared to the same period in 2005.
Revenues
- 2Q06 consolidated revenues rose 52 percent to $5.41 billion from $3.55 billion in 2Q05, with total premium and administrative services fees also up 52 percent compared to the prior years quarter. These increases were primarily the result of higher enrollment in the companys Medicare Advantage plans and new 2006 revenues from stand-alone PDPs for Medicare beneficiaries.
1H06 consolidated revenues rose 46 percent to $10.11 billion from $6.93 billion in 1H05 with total premium and administrative services fees up 45 percent compared to the prior years period, also primarily driven by enrollment in the companys Medicare Advantage plans and stand-alone PDPs.
Medical costs
- The companys medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenue or MER) of 85.1 percent in 2Q06 was 130 basis points higher than that for 2Q05 as year-over-year improvement in this metric for the Commercial Segment was offset by a higher Government Segment MER. The higher MER in the Government Segment primarily results from the introduction of the stand-alone PDP results in 2006, as described more fully in the Government Segment results discussion below.
The consolidated MER for 1H06 of 84.4 percent was 60 basis points higher than the 1H05 consolidated MER of 83.8 percent, driven by the same factors affecting the 2Q06 MER.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
- The companys consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees or SG&A expense ratio) decreased to 13.7 percent for 2Q06 from 14.0 percent
(a)
in 2Q05. This resulted primarily from growth in revenues which began to outpace the related increase in administrative spending on a consolidated basis during the quarter. The consolidated SG&A ratio improved 240 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2006 for this reason.
The SG&A expense ratio for 1H06 of 14.8 percent was 70 basis points higher than the 1H05 ratio of 14.1 percent
(a)
due to the increase in SG&A expenses associated with the Medicare expansion in the first quarter of 2006 coupled with an increase in the percentage of Commercial medical members in ASO accounts. The increase in the Medicare administrative costs results from the build out of infrastructure and support functions in advance of the anticipated continued escalation in enrollment as well as sales and marketing spending occurring in a more concentrated 2006 Medicare selling season.

Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 2Q06 of $534.9 million compared to $179.3 million
(a)
in 2Q05. The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis
(b)(c)
.
Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations rose to $277.7 million in 2Q06 from $179.3 million in 2Q05 driven by growth in the companys Medicare operations. The company now expects that cash flows from operations for 2006 will be in the range of $850 million to $950 million driven by expected higher earnings over the prior year together with anticipated changes in working capital.
