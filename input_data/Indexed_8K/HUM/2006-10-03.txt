Item 8.01  Other Events
          On September 29, 2006, Humana Inc. (the "Company" or "Humana") received approval from The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) of its Medicare benefit plans for 2007. The related 2006 written agreements between the Company and CMS have been renewed for another one year term, and two new contracts allowing the Company to offer benefit plans in New York and Puerto Rico are now effective. The renewed 2006 contracts and the two new agreements are collectively referred to herein as the "CMS Contracts."
          Humana will offer the following plans for its Medicare members effective beginning January 1, 2007:
Medicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans, statewide in 40 states, select counties in the remaining 10 states, and Puerto Rico;
Regional Medicare Advantage Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans in 23 states across 14 Medicare Advantage regions;
Local Medicare Advantage PPO plans in 117 counties across 14 states;
Medicare Advantage Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans in 60 counties across 7 states and Puerto Rico; and
Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) statewide in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
          Humana will offer several different PDP plans. In all areas except Puerto Rico, Humana will include a PDP option for generic drug coverage through the coverage gap. For 2007, as was the case for 2006, Humana was successful in bidding below each Regional benchmark. Accordingly, the Company will avoid reassignment of all current PDP members who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage (also known as "dual eligible" members) that were automatically allocated to Humana in 2006, and further, the Company may benefit from the reallocation to it of other dual eligible members previously assigned to other non-Humana plans.
          The marketing process for the Company's 2007 Medicare offerings began on October 1, 2006, with enrollment beginning November 15, 2006.
          Each of the CMS Contracts was effective when signed, has a termination date of December 31, 2007, and may be renewed for successive one-year terms subject to the consent of the parties and their agreement on a bid as submitted by Humana or its subsidiaries. Each of the CMS Contracts may be terminated by either party in the event of the failure by the other to substantially carry out its obligations under the CMS Contracts, and by CMS in the event of a violation by Humana of relevant CMS regulations. The above summary is qualified by reference to the CMS Contracts, forms of which were attached as exhibits to Humana's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated:    October 3, 2006
