LOUISVILLE, KY (October 30, 2006)
- Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) today reported $0.95 in diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 (3Q06), within the range of the companys previous guidance of $0.95 to $1.00. The 3Q06 EPS compares to $0.28
(a)(d)(e)
EPS for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 (3Q05). Excluding 3Q05 expenses related to the settlement of class action litigation
(d)
and Hurricane Katrina
(e)
, EPS for 3Q06 is up 64 percent
(b)
versus the prior year. The year-over-year improvement in the quarter results from substantial earnings increases in both of the companys business segments.
The company continues to estimate EPS for the year ending December 31, 2006 (FY06E) in the range of $2.82 to $2.88
(f)
versus $1.79
(a)(d)(e)(g)
for the year ended December 31, 2005 (FY05), a growth rate of approximately 60 percent. The company also anticipates significant growth in its earnings for the year ending December 31, 2007 (FY07E) with EPS projected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10, a growth rate of 35 to 45 percent.
 
Our third-quarter results kept us on track to increase earnings per share by approximately 60 percent over 2005, said Michael B. McCallister, Humanas president and chief executive officer. With year-to-date revenues up nearly 50 percent, 2006 is playing out as planned and positioning us for another year of robust earnings and revenue growth in 2007.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2006 (YTD06) the company reported $1.98
(f)
in EPS compared to $1.42
(a)(d)(e)(g)
for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 (YTD05), a growth rate of 39 percent. Excluding 1Q06 excess net investment gains
(f)
, the first quarter 2005 favorable tax contingency
(g)
and 3Q05 expenses related to the settlement of class action litigation
(d)
and Hurricane Katrina
(e)
, EPS for YTD06 is up 18 percent
(b)
versus the prior year driven by improvement in operating results in both of the companys business segments.
Revenues
- 3Q06 consolidated revenues rose 48 percent to $5.65 billion from $3.82 billion in 3Q05, with total premium and administrative services fees up 47 percent compared to the prior years quarter. These increases were primarily the result of higher enrollment in the companys Medicare Advantage plans and new 2006 revenues from stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) for Medicare beneficiaries.
YTD06 consolidated revenues rose 47 percent to $15.76 billion from $10.76 billion YTD05 with total premium and administrative services fees up 46 percent compared to the prior years period, also primarily driven by enrollment in the companys Medicare Advantage plans and stand-alone PDPs.
Medical costs
- The companys medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenue or MER) of 84.1 percent in 3Q06 was 70 basis points higher than the 3Q05 MER of 83.4 percent
(e)
due to an increase in the Government Segment MER outweighing an improvement in that for the Commercial Segment. The change in MER in the Government Segment primarily results from the introduction of the stand-alone PDP results in 2006, as described more fully in the Government Segment results discussion below.
The consolidated MER for YTD06 of 84.3 percent was 70 basis points higher than the YTD05 consolidated MER of 83.6 percent
(e)
, driven by the same factors impacting the third quarter year-over-year comparison.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
- The companys consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) decreased to 13.1 percent for 3Q06 from 16.3 percent
(a)(d)(e)
in 3Q05. This resulted primarily from litigation
(d)
and hurricane charges
(e)
incurred in 3Q05 that did not recur in 3Q06. Further, the 3Q06 growth in revenues continued to outpace the related increase in administrative spending on a consolidated basis leading to a 60 basis-point improvement in the SG&A expense ratio compared to the second quarter of 2006.
The SG&A expense ratio for YTD06 of 14.2 percent was 70 basis points lower than the YTD05 ratio of 14.9 percent
(a)(d)(e)
, primarily due to the benefit of administrative costs YTD05 for the settlement of class action litigation
(d)
and Hurricane Katrina
(e)
which did not recur in YTD06. Partially offsetting that benefit was the increase in the YTD06 Medicare administrative costs associated with the build out of infrastructure and support functions in advance of the escalation in enrollment during the first half of 2006, as well as sales and marketing spending occurring in a more concentrated 2006 Medicare selling season.
