Exhibit 99
 
 
 
LOUISVILLE, KY (February 5, 2007)
- Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported $0.92 in diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 (4Q06), above the companys previous guidance for EPS of $0.84 to $0.90. The 4Q06 EPS compares to $0.37
(a)(e)
EPS for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 (4Q05). Excluding 4Q05 expenses of $0.07 per share related to Hurricane Katrina
(e)
, EPS for 4Q06 is up 109 percent
(b)
versus the prior year. The year-over-year improvement in the quarter results from substantial earnings increases from membership growth in the companys Government segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2006 (FY06), the company reported EPS of $2.90
(f)
versus $1.79
(a)(d)(e)(g)
for the year ended December 31, 2005 (FY05), an increase of 62 percent.
Humana now estimates EPS for the year ending December 31, 2007 (FY07E) in the range of $4.00 to $4.20
 
versus the companys previous estimate of $3.90 to $4.10. The companys revised outlook for 2007 equates to a growth rate of 38 to 45 percent over the FY06 EPS of $2.90
(f)
.
Strong fourth quarter results capped off a record-breaking year in which Medicare membership growth dramatically increased Humanas size, geographic reach and brand awareness
, said Michael B. McCallister, Humanas president and chief executive officer. This enabled us to exceed our EPS estimates for the quarter and the year. Just as importantly, it positioned us for further progress in 2007, as shown by our raising full-year EPS guidance this morning.

Revenues
- 4Q06 consolidated revenues rose 54 percent to $5.66 billion from $3.66 billion in 4Q05, with total premium and administrative services fees up 53 percent compared to the prior years quarter. Investment income increased by 87 percent year over year in 4Q06 to $79.9 million driven by higher invested balances during 4Q06 and the timing of venture capital investment gains in FY06 versus FY05. Other income increased to $25.9 million in 4Q06 from $4.6 million in 4Q05 primarily because of operations of the companys mail order pharmacy facility which opened during the first half of FY06.
FY06 consolidated revenues rose 49 percent to $21.42 billion from $14.42 billion in FY05 with total premium and administrative services fees up 48 percent compared to the prior years period. Both the quarter and full year increases were primarily the result of higher enrollment in the companys Medicare Advantage plans and new 2006 revenues from stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) for Medicare beneficiaries.
Medical costs
- The companys consolidated medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenue or MER) of 83.2 percent in 4Q06 was 110 basis points higher than the 4Q05 MER of 82.1 percent
(e)
due to an increase in the Government Segment MER outweighing an improvement in that for the Commercial Segment. The change in MER in the Government Segment was primarily due to the stand-alone PDP results in 2006, as described more fully in the Government Segment results discussion below.
The consolidated MER for FY06 of 84.0 percent was 80 basis points higher than the FY05 consolidated MER of 83.2 percent
(e)
, driven by the same factors impacting the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
- The companys consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) decreased to 14.7 percent for 4Q06 from 16.9 percent
(a)
in 4Q05. The year-over-year decline of 220 basis points was primarily the result of administrative cost leverage associated with revenues from higher average medical membership. Administrative spending associated with the 2007 open enrollment period for Medicare primarily led to a 160 basis-point increase in the consolidated SG&A expense ratio in 4Q06 compared to the third quarter of 2006.
The SG&A expense ratio for FY06 of 14.3 percent was 110 basis points lower than the FY05 ratio of 15.4 percent
(a)(d)(e)
, primarily due to the administrative cost leverage provided by revenues from higher average medical membership. Additionally, the FY06 ratio improved year-over-year as a result of administrative costs in FY05 for the settlement of class action litigation
(d)
which did not recur in FY06.

.
 
Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations rose to $534.9 million in 4Q06 from $134.0 million
