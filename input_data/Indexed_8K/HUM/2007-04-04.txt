Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
                  An Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract ("Amendment") to the contract between Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc. ("HMHS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana Inc., and the United States Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity ("TMA") concerning Humana's contract with TMA for administration of the TRICARE program in TMA's South Region became effective as of April 1, 2007. A copy of the Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.
                  The Amendment (i) extends the term of the contract through Option Period IV, which runs from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008, and (ii) incorporates into the contract the parties' negotiated target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee for Option Period IV.
                  HMHS, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, has been a Department of Defense contractor for the TRICARE program since July 1, 1996. In August 2003, HMHS was awarded the contract to provide health benefits support and services to approximately 2.8 million active duty and retired military and their eligible family members in the ten-state South Region.
                  Revenues associated with the anticipated contract amendment and the related earnings thereon were included in Humana's 2007 consolidated guidance in the Company's earnings press release dated February 5, 2007.
