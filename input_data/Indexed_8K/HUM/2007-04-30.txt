- Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported $0.42 in diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 (1Q07), above the companys previous guidance for 1Q07 EPS of $0.35 to $0.40. The company earned $0.50per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 (1Q06), including a $0.19 per share benefit from the sale of a venture capital investment. Excluding the venture capital gain, the significant year-over-year increase in quarterly earnings resulted primarily from higher operating earnings in the companys Commercial Segment.
LOUISVILLE, KY (April 30, 2007)
 
Humana now estimates EPS for the year ending December 31, 2007 (FY07E) will be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25versus $2.90 for the year ended December 31, 2006 (FY06), a growth rate of 41 to 47 percent.
 
 
We were well prepared in the first quarter to execute successfully on another year's Medicare open enrollment while simultaneously improving Commercial results," said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. "Based on our first quarter results, we feel comfortable raising our 2007 EPS guidance to a range that represents an increase of more than 40 percent over our record-breaking 2006 results.
- 1Q07 consolidated revenues rose 32 percent to $6.20 billion from $4.70 billion in 1Q06, with total premium and administrative services fees up 33 percent compared to the prior years quarter primarily driven by higher average Medicare membership than in 1Q06.
Revenues
1
Investment income of $73.5 million in 1Q07 compared to $98.9 million for 1Q06. The change in investment income resulted from the $51.7 million venture capital gain in 1Q06 that did not recur in 1Q07, partially offset by the ongoing investment income derived from higher average invested balances in 1Q07. Higher invested balances have resulted primarily from the companys substantial growth in operations.
Other revenue of $30.9 million for 1Q07 compares favorably to $5.3 million for 1Q06. The increase was primarily driven by higher specialty product revenue associated with Source, the companys mail order pharmacy.

- The companys consolidated medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenue or MER) of 86.8 percent in 1Q07 was 310 basis points higher than the 1Q06 MER of 83.7 percent due to an expected increase in the Government Segment MER outweighing significant improvement in that for the Commercial Segment.
Medical costs
- The companys consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums plus administrative services fees) decreased 260 basis points to 13.5 percent for 1Q07 from 16.1 percent in 1Q06. The year-over-year decline was primarily the result of administrative cost leverage associated with increased revenues from higher average medical membership.
