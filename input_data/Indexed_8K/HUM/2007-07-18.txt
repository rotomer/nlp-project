Full year 2007 EPS now anticipated to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.50
Improved consolidated administrative expense ratio
Better-than-expected operating performance in both business segments
Detailed 2Q07 financial results to be released on July 30, 2007
- Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 (2Q07) of $1.28, significantly above the company's previous guidance for 2Q07 EPS of $1.15 to $1.20. The company earned $0.53 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 (2Q06).
LOUISVILLE, KY (July 18, 2007)
The company's 2Q07 EPS was better than expected for the quarter primarily due to an improving consolidated selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense ratio combined with improving medical expense ratios in its Medicare and Commercial businesses. These same factors also drove the year-over-year improvement in EPS and are anticipated to positively impact operating performance for the full year. Consequently, the company is raising its estimate for EPS for the year ending December 31, 2007 to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 versus its prior expectation of at least $4.25 per share. The company earned $2.90 per share for the year ended December 31, 2006.
The company will issue its detailed 2Q07 earnings press release on July 30, 2007 at 6:00 a.m. eastern time and will be hosting a conference call, as well as a virtual slide presentation, at 9:00 a.m. eastern time that same day to discuss its detailed financial results for the quarter and the company's expectations for future performance.
The live virtual presentation (audio with slides) may be accessed via Humana's Investor Relations page at www.humana.com. The company suggests web participants sign on approximately 15 minutes in advance of the call. An Adobe version of the slide presentation will also be posted to Humana's web site to ensure access for those listeners with Internet firewall issues. The company also suggests web participants visit the site well in advance of the call to run a system test and to download any free software needed to view the presentation.
