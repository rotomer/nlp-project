LOUISVILLE, KY (July 30, 2007)
announced in the companys July 18, 2007 press release.  The company earned $0.53
 
per share
for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 (2Q06).  The year-over-year improvement in second quarter results reflected higher operating earnings in both of the companys business segments, primarily driven by efficiency gains in its consolidated administrative costs as well as medical expense ratio improvement.
As
also announced on July 18, 2007, the company estimates EPS for the year ending December 31, 2007 (FY07E) will be in the range of $4.40 to $4.50 versus $2.90 for the year ended December 31, 2006 (FY06).
An across-the-board focus on operational excellence led to an extremely strong second quarter, said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer. These same dynamics are expected to fuel Humanas performance for the remainder of the year and position us well for growth into the future.
in EPS compared to $1.03 for the six months ended June 30, 2006 (1H06).  Results for 1H06 included approximately $0.19 per share of venture capital gains that did not recur in 1H07.  The year-over-year increase in 1H07 financial results was primarily due to better operating performance in both business segments.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007 (1H07) the company reported $1.70

 2Q07 consolidated revenues rose 19 percent to $6.43 billion from $5.41 billion in 2Q06, with total premium and administrative services fees up 18 percent compared to the prior years quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher average Medicare membership versus 2Q06.
Revenues
1H07 consolidated revenues rose 25 percent to $12.63 billion from $10.11 billion in 1H06 with total premium and administrative services fees up 25 percent compared to the prior years period, also primarily driven by higher average enrollment in the companys Medicare plans.
 The 2Q07 consolidated medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenues or MER) of 83.4 percent was 170 basis points lower than the 2Q06 MER of 85.1 percent as a result of MER improvement in both the Government and Commercial segments.
Medical costs
The consolidated MER for 1H07 of 85.1 percent was 70 basis points higher than the 1H06 consolidated MER of 84.4 percent, as the year-over-year increase in the Government Segment MER resulting from the Medicare Part D claims pattern outweighed the improvement in the Commercial Segment MER.
 The 2Q07 consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums, administrative services fees and other revenue) decreased 70 basis points to 13.0 percent for 2Q07 from 13.7 percent in 2Q06.  The year-over-year decline was primarily the result of improving administrative cost efficiency and productivity gains associated with servicing the companys 11.3 million medical members.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
The SG&A expense ratio for 1H07 of 13.2 percent was 160 basis points lower than that for 1H06 of 14.8 percent also primarily driven by efficiency and productivity gains.
