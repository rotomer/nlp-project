Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
On September 27, 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") made public the detailed results of its open-market bidding process for 2008 stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans ("PDPs") by plan and geography (the "CMS Release").
Humana Inc. (the "Company") priced its 2008 PDP bids based upon its full-year 2006 claims experience which, together with an average target pretax margin in the 4 to 5 percent range, resulted in the Company exceeding the benchmarks for the assignment of low-income beneficiaries in several states. Those actions are expected to result in CMS automatically reassigning approximately 265,000 beneficiaries to other health plans. Additionally, approximately 180,000 low-income beneficiaries who electively joined Humana, and who reside in areas where Humana is no longer below the benchmark, will be notified of the incremental monthly premium above the benchmark they must pay to remain with Humana. Should any member choose not to pay that premium, the member may opt for another PDP below the benchmark in the member's geography of residence. After completing an initial analysis of competitor positioning with respect to low-income PDP membership pricing pursuant to the CMS Release, the Company bel ieves it will gain approximately 25,000 to 50,000 PDP members when low-income beneficiaries from other plans exceeding the benchmarks are reallocated.
The net change in low-income PDP membership is not expected to have a negative impact upon the Company's earnings for 2008.
The Company intends to provide consolidated earnings guidance for 2008 (including membership expectations by line of business) in its third quarter 2007 earnings release scheduled for Monday, October 29, 2007.
