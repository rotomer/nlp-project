Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
On October 5, 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") provided Humana Inc. (the "Company") with detailed support for CMS's calculations of amounts for the 2006 plan year in accordance with provisions for the Medicare Part D program risk-share corridors, low-income cost subsidies, and reinsurance subsidies.
Amounts due in connection with risk-sharing result from CMS and plan sponsors sharing in variances between actual costs and targeted costs for prescription drugs utilized by beneficiaries during the plan year. As disclosed in footnote 4 of its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, Humana has recorded a current liability of approximately $728 million in connection with the Medicare Part D risk sharing provisions for the 2006 plan year. This amount is not materially different from the $726 million included in the detailed calculation the Company received from CMS on October 5, 2007.
The Medicare Part D program also provides for CMS subsidies, whereby CMS assumes responsibility for the reimbursement of individual cost-sharing amounts for low-income beneficiaries, as well as responsibility for the reimbursement of the majority of catastrophic claim expenses, such that plans are substantially not at risk for catastrophic claim amounts. CMS generally pays plans monthly estimates for these low-income cost subsidies and reinsurance subsidies, with the final transfer of funds occurring concurrent with the settlement of the risk sharing for the plan year. Funds exchanged in connection with these subsidies generally do not impact a plan's income from operations or operating cash flows. The amounts recently disclosed by CMS for amounts due to and from Humana in connection with these subsidies were also in line with Humana's estimates.
The Company has also been advised by CMS that the net payable due to CMS for the items noted above will be withheld from the Company's monthly payment for November 2007, as previously anticipated in the Company's guidance for operating cash flows for 2007.
