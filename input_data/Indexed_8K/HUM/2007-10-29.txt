 Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 (3Q07) including diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $1.78
LOUISVILLE, KY (October 29, 2007)
, significantly above the companys previous guidance for 3Q07 EPS of $1.45 to $1.50.  The company earned $0.95 per share for the quarter ended
September 30, 2006
(3Q06).  The companys 3Q07 EPS included earnings of $0.25 per share
(a)
that are not anticipated to recur in future periods. The companys 3Q07 performance was also $0.05 per share better than expected due to ongoing improvements in the companys Commercial operations and stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) that are expected to positively impact fourth quarter 2007 and full-year 2008 results.
The company now estimates EPS
for the year ending
December 31, 2007
(FY07E) will be
in the range of $4.75 to $4.8
0 versus $2.90 for the year ended
December 31, 2006
(FY06).
  The company also projects its EPS for the year ending
December 31, 2008
(FY08E) to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.50, an increase
of 10 to 16 percent over FY07E EPS, or 16 to 22 percent
(a)(

)
versus
the
non-GAAP EPS for FY07E.
Strong performance in both our business segments fueled a successful third quarter,Most importantly, the quarter positioned us well to extend our industry-leading growth in both revenues and earnings through 2008 and beyond.
said Michael B. McCallister, Humana's president and chief executive officer.
in EPS compared to $1.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 (YTD06).  Results for YTD07 on a non-GAAP basisshare.  Results for YTD06 included approximately $0.19 per share of venture capital gains that did not recur in YTD07.  The year-over-year increase in YTD07 financial results was primarily due to better operating performance in both business segments.
For the nine months ended
September 30, 2007
(YTD07) the company reported $3.48
 
were $3.23 per diluted

 3Q07 consolidated revenues rose 12 percent to $6.32 billion from $5.65 billion in 3Q06, with total premium and administrative services fees up 11 percent compared to the prior years quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher average Medicare membership versus 3Q06.
Revenues
YTD07 consolidated revenues rose 20 percent to $18.95 billion from $15.76 billion in YTD06 with total premium and administrative services fees up 20 percent compared to the prior years period, also primarily driven by higher average enrollment in the companys Medicare plans.
 The 3Q07 consolidated medical expense ratio (medical expenses as a percent of premium revenues or MER) of 81.3 percent was 280 basis points lower than the 3Q06 MER of 84.1 percent, the combined result of a 360 basis point decline in the Government Segment MER (including a 150 basis point benefit from favorable prior year claims development) and a 70 basis point decline in the Commercial Segment MER.
Medical costs
(a)
The consolidated MER for YTD07 of 83.8 percent was 50 basis points lower than the YTD06 consolidated MER of 84.3 percent, substantially due to the same factors driving the year-over-year improvement in 3Q07.
 The 3Q07 consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums, administrative services fees and other revenue) increased 20 basis points to 13.3 percent for 3Q07 from 13.1 percent in 3Q06.  The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of a higher SG&A expense ratio in both of the companys business segments.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
The SG&A expense ratio for YTD07 of 13.2 percent was 100 basis points lower than that for YTD06 of 14.2 percent primarily driven by efficiency and productivity gains associated with higher average medical membership year to date.

Balance Sheet
 
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows used in operations for 3Q07 of $637.7 million compared to cash flows used in operations of $391.0 million in 3Q06.
 
 
The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis.  Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations declined to $537.6 million in 3Q07 from $640.8 million in 3Q06 driven primarily by changes in working capital more than offsetting the impact of higher operating earnings.
