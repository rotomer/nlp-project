On January 9, 2008, officers of Humana Inc. (the "Company") will be meeting with investors and analysts at an industry conference. During the meetings, the Company intends to address its prospects and performance and will reaffirm the Company's earnings per share guidance for the full year 2008 of $5.30 to $5.50 as well as reiterating the Company's Medicare Advantage enrollment guidance for net membership additions in the range of 200,000 to 250,000 for the full year 2008. Gross sales for Medicare Advantage to date for 2008 are on track with the Company's expectations, while gross sales for stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans are somewhat ahead of expectations. The Company is continuing to receive January 2008 disenrollment data for all Medicare plans from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), consistent with historical disenrollment reporting patterns from CMS.
The Company has entered its quiet period before reporting fourth quarter 2007 earnings on February 4, 2008 and will not be commenting on financial results for that period in its discussions at this industry conference.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Dated: January 9, 2008
