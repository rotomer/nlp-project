Humana Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Financial Results
2007 EPS of $4.91, ahead of company expectations
Raising projected 2008 EPS to a range of $5.35 to $5.55
Revenues of $25.3 billion in 2007
Medical membership of 11.5 million at December 31, 2007
Specialty membership of 6.8 million at December 31, 2007
January 2008 Medicare Advantage membership of 1,243,000
2007 operating cash flows of $1.2 billion
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 (4Q07) including diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $1.43, significantly above the companys previous guidance for 4Q07 EPS of $1.27 to $1.32 primarily due to a lower income tax rate for 2007 than previously anticipated and a gain from the sale of a venture capital investment during 4Q07. The company earned $0.92 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 (4Q06).
For the year ended December 31, 2007 (FY07), the company reported EPS of $4.91 versus $2.90 for the year ended December 31, 2006 (FY06). The companys FY07 EPS included earnings of $0.25 per share that are not anticipated to recur in future periods.
(a)(b)
(a)
The company has raised its EPS projection for the year ending December 31, 2008 (FY08E) to reflect a lower tax rate than previously anticipated, with EPS now expected to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, an increase of 9 to 13 percent over FY07 EPS, or 15 to 19 percent versus the non-GAAP EPS for FY07.
(a)(b)
Our 2007 results show that Humanas unique value proposition resonates deeply with Americas seniors, said Michael B. McCallister, the company's president and chief executive officer. Treating members as actively engaged health-care consumers instead of passive health-care users is what we do across all our lines of business, and accounts for Humanas across-the-board growth and success.
 4Q07 consolidated revenues rose 12 percent to $6.34 billion from $5.66 billion in 4Q06, with total premium and administrative services fees up 12 percent compared to the prior years quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher average Medicare Advantage membership versus 4Q06.
Revenues
FY07 consolidated revenues rose 18 percent to $25.29 billion from $21.42 billion in FY06 with total premium and administrative services fees up 18 percent compared to the prior years period, also primarily driven by higher average enrollment in the companys Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs).
 The 4Q07 consolidated benefits ratio (benefit expenses as a percent of premium revenues) of 80.3 percent was 290 basis points lower than the 4Q06 benefit ratio of 83.2 percent, the combined result of a 360 basis point decline in the Government Segment benefits ratio and a 110 basis point decline in the Commercial Segment benefits ratio.
Benefit expenses
(c)
(c)
The consolidated benefits ratio for FY07 of 83.0 percent was 100 basis points lower than the FY06 consolidated benefits ratio of 84.0 percent, substantially due to a 120 basis point decline in the Government Segment benefits ratio (including a 40 basis point benefit from favorable prior year claims development) and a 120 basis point improvement in the benefits ratio for the Commercial Segment.
(a)
 The 4Q07 consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums, administrative services fees and other revenue) increased 130 basis points to 16.0 percent for 4Q07 from 14.7 percent in 4Q06. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher marketing and other administrative expenses associated with the Medicare selling season for 2008 enrollment, which began during 4Q07, as well as the acquisition of two specialty products companies in 4Q07.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
The SG&A expense ratio for FY07 of 13.9 percent was 40 basis points lower than that for FY06 of 14.3 percent primarily driven by efficiency and productivity gains associated with higher average medical membership year to date, partially offset by the companys expanding mail-order pharmacy business as well as differences in the composition of the companys medical membership portfolio for 2007 versus 2006.
 The effective income tax rate for 4Q07 of 32.2 percent was significantly lower than the September 30, 2007 year-to-date rate of 36.5 percent reflecting a revised estimate for the companys state tax rate and the favorable resolution of an Internal Revenue Service audit item.
Income taxes
The effective income tax rate for FY07 declined 70 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the benefit from a lower state tax rate as the companys earnings became more geographically diverse in FY07.
Government Segment Results
Pretax results:
Government Segment pretax earnings were $304.6 million in 4Q07 compared to $187.3 millionin 4Q06. As expected, the year-over-year improvement in fourth quarter pretax earnings for this segment primarily reflects a more normal benefits ratio pattern for the Part D benefit for 2007 as well as administrative cost efficiency associated with higher average Medicare Advantage membership. The extended enrollment period for the Part D benefit during 2006 distorted the claims pattern associated with the beneficiaries progression through the Part D benefit stages in that year.
For FY07, pretax earnings for the Government Segment of $1.03 billion increased by $513.7 million, or 100 percent versus FY06 pretax earnings for the segment of $513.8 million, primarily reflecting the same factors impacting the year-over-year comparison for the fourth quarter. This segments pretax earnings for FY07 on a non-GAAP basis were $958.7 million.
(a)(b)
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership grew to 1,143,000 at December 31, 2007, an increase of 140,400, or 14 percent, from December 31, 2006 and was essentially unchanged versus September 30, 2007. Average Medicare Advantage membership for 4Q07 was up 14 percent compared to that for 4Q06. The companys expanded participation in various Medicare products and markets combined with the companys increased sales and marketing efforts for these programs led to the higher membership level year over year.
Membership in the companys stand-alone PDPs totaled 3,442,000 at December 31, 2007 compared to 3,536,600 at December 31, 2006 and 3,459,700 at September 30, 2007.
January 2008 membership in the companys Medicare Advantage plans approximated 1,243,000.
January 2008 Medicare stand-alone PDP membership approximated 3,180,000.
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Medicare Advantage premiums of $2.80 billion in 4Q07 increased 22 percent compared to $2.30 billion in 4Q06, primarily the result of higher average membership.
Medicare stand-alone PDP premiums of $820.3 million in 4Q07 decreased 7 percent compared to $882.0 million in 4Q06, primarily the result of a 2 percent decline in average membership versus that for 4Q06.
Military services premiums and administrative services fees during 4Q07 increased $30.6 million to $691.0 million compared to $660.4 million in 4Q06.
(d)
Benefit Expenses:
(c)
The Government Segment benefits ratio decreased 360 basis points to 80.1 percent in 4Q07 compared to 83.7 percent in the prior years quarter. This decrease reflects a more normalized benefits ratio pattern for the Medicare Part D benefit for 2007. The extended enrollment period for this benefit during the prior year distorted the claims pattern associated with the beneficiaries progression through the Part D benefit stages in 2006.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segments SG&A expense ratio for 4Q07 of 13.7 percent was 140 basis points higher than that for 4Q06 of 12.3 percent and increased 350 basis points from the third quarter of 2007. Each of these changes was primarily the result of higher marketing and other administrative expenses associated with the Medicare selling season for 2008 enrollment which began during 4Q07.
Commercial Segment Results
Pretax results:
Commercial Segment pretax earnings were $54.4 million in 4Q07 compared to $53.9 million in 4Q06. Commercial Segment operating earnings in 4Q07 continue to reflect the companys commitment to underwriting discipline and strategic growth in select lines of business.
For FY07, pretax earnings for the Commercial Segment of $261.8 million were $13.5 million, or 5 percent higher than FY06 pretax earnings for the segment of $248.2 million. Operating earnings for this segment excluding venture capital gains reflect a full year of the companys commitment to underwriting discipline and strategic line-of-business growth. Venture capital gains included in this segments results were $6.3 million in FY07 versus $56.0 million in FY06.
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership grew 167,800 members to 3,451,600 at December 31, 2007, an increase of 5 percent from December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2007. Approximately 95,900 of the increase in medical members related to members acquired via an acquisition completed during 4Q07 (primarily ASO members).
Membership in strategic areas of commercial growth rose organically as follows during 4Q07 compared to 4Q06: Individual product membership increased 35 percent, Smart plans and other consumer offerings membership grew 29 percent, Small Group business membership was up 2 percent, and total ASO members were 1 percent higher than the prior year.
Membership in Commercial Segment specialty products at December 31, 2007 rose to 6,783,800 compared to 1,902,800 at December 31, 2006, primarily driven by the addition of membership from two specialty-product companies acquired during 4Q07.
(e)
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment increased 11 percent to $1.74 billion in 4Q07 compared to $1.57 billion in the prior years quarter, primarily due to commitment to underwriting discipline, strategic line-of-business growth and the acquisition of two specialty products companies in 4Q07.
Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully-insured groups increased approximately 5 percent on a per-member basis during 4Q07 compared to 4Q06.
Benefit Expenses:
In 4Q07, the Commercial Segment benefits ratio of 81.0 percent was 110 basis points lower than the 4Q06 benefits ratio of 82.1 percent, primarily reflecting the acquisition of two specialty products companies in 4Q07, continued underwriting discipline and strategic medical membership line-of-business growth.
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio of 21.8 percent for 4Q07 compares to 20.4 percent in 4Q06, primarily the combined result of higher average Individual and ASO membership, costs associated with increased business for the companys mail order pharmacy, and the acquisition of two specialty products companies in 4Q07. Average Individual product membership rose 32 percent and average ASO membership increased 3 percent versus the prior years quarter.
Balance Sheet
Cash and cash equivalents declined $545.2 million or 21 percent sequentially due to the payment of Part D risk-share payable of approximately $726 million.
Parent company cash and investments increased $111.3 million to $535.7 million at December 31, 2007 from $424.4 million at December 31, 2006.
Debt-to-total capitalization at December 31, 2007 was 29.5 percent, up 380 basis points from September 30, 2007 due primarily to the completion of two acquisitions during 4Q07. This ratio was up 10 basis points compared to December 31, 2006.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows used in operations for 4Q07 of $189.8 million compared to cash flows provided by operations of $534.9 million in 4Q06 primarily reflects the payment of Part D risk-share payable for the 2006 plan year of approximately $726 million.
FY07 cash flows from operations of $1.22 billion versus $1.69 billion for FY06 also reflect the same factors impacting 4Q07 year-over-year comparisons.
Acquisitions
During 4Q07, the company completed the acquisitions of CompBenefits Corporation and KMG America Corporation (KMG) for total cash consideration of approximately $525 million plus the assumption of approximately $36 million of debt. CompBenefits is a leading full-service provider of dental and vision benefit plans and increased Humanas specialty membership by approximately 4.4 million. KMG offers supplemental life and health insurance products and services and increased Humanas specialty membership approximately 427,500 and the companys medical membership by 95,900.

Footnotes
During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the company realized pretax income of approximately $68.9 million ($0.25 per share after tax) related to favorable prior-year claims development that it does not anticipate recurring in future periods, with approximately $54.0 million related to 2006 Medicare Part D claims and the remainder related to Military services claims. The Medicare Part D development primarily related to the resolution of first-year Part D implementation matters including enrollment discrepancies and the related impact on claim estimates. The claims development related to Military services resulted from the settlement of certain claims payment accuracy provisions for prior option periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts related to this favorable development is included in the statistical pages of this earnings press release.
(a)
The company believes that the non-GAAP measures included in this release, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
(b)
The company has renamed medical expenses as benefit expenses and the related medical expense ratio as benefits ratio reflecting the expansion of its specialty offerings in 4Q07.
(c)
The company has renamed TRICARE as military services reflecting the addition of contracts with the Department of Veteran Affairs in 4Q07.
(d)
The Commercial Segment provides a full range of insured specialty products including dental, vision and other supplemental products. Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products.
(e)
Approximately 500,000 members in stand-alone stop loss, long-term care, and network access products previously reported by KMG have been excluded from Humanas membership statistics since the related business is not material to Humanas operations.
(f)
