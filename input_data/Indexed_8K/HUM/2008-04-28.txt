Humana Reports First Quarter Financial Results
1Q08 diluted earnings per common share of $0.47
Revenues and net income up 12 percent over prior years quarter
Medicare Advantage net membership gains effective through April 2008 of 153,000
PDP benefit expense for 1Q08 and full year 2008 estimates in line with March 12, 2008 guidance
Commercial Segment benefit expense ratio improves 260 basis points versus prior year
Improvement in claims cycle time impacts days in claims payable and operating cash flow
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 (1Q08) including diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $0.47, ahead of managements previous guidance for EPS of $0.44 to $0.46, primarily due to a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate. The company earned $0.42 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 (1Q07).
The company also announced that it had raised its EPS projection for the year ending December 31, 2008 to a range of $4.10 to $4.35 to reflect a lower diluted share count and effective tax rate for the full year.
Our Medicare Advantage and Commercial progress was particularly strong in the first quarter, said Michael B. McCallister, the company's president and chief executive officer. Our first quarter earnings, and our success in achieving targeted Medicare Advantage membership gains year to date, give us confidence that well continue to see solid improvement in all non-Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) lines of business through 2008 and beyond. We expect to return our stand-alone PDPs to profitability in 2009.
 1Q08 consolidated revenues rose 12 percent to $6.96 billion from $6.20 billion in 1Q07, with total premium and administrative services fees also up 12 percent compared to the prior years quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher average Medicare Advantage membership in 1Q08 versus 1Q07.
Revenues
 The 1Q08 consolidated benefits ratio (benefit expenses as a percent of premium revenues) of 86.7 percent was 10 basis points lower than the 1Q07 benefit ratio of 86.8 percent, the combined result of a 70 basis point increase in the Government Segment benefits ratio and a 260 basis point decline in the Commercial Segment benefits ratio.
Benefit expenses
 The 1Q08 consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums, administrative services fees and other revenue) increased 40 basis points to 13.8 percent for 1Q08 from 13.4 percent in 1Q07. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of two specialty products companies in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
Government Segment Results
Pretax results:
As expected, the Government Segment experienced a pretax loss of $3.2 million in 1Q08 compared to pretax income of $17.9 millionin 1Q07. The year-over-year decline in operating performance primarily reflected approximately $100 million in incremental expense for 1Q08 associated with the companys stand-alone PDPs, as described in the companys news release on March 12, 2008. Also as expected, that incremental expense was substantially offset by improved operating performance in the companys Medicare Advantage and military services businesses.
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership grew to 1,267,700 at March 31, 2008, an increase of 154,300, or 14 percent, from March 31, 2007 and up 124,700, or 11 percent versus December 31, 2007. Approximately 45 percent of the net Medicare Advantage membership increase year over year was in the companys Medicare Advantage PPO products.
Membership in the companys stand-alone PDPs totaled 3,150,200 at March 31, 2008 compared to 3,473,700 at March 31, 2007 and 3,442,000 at December 31, 2007.
April 2008 membership in the companys Medicare Advantage plans approximated 1,296,000.
April 2008 Medicare stand-alone PDP membership approximated 3,130,000.
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Medicare Advantage premiums of $3.17 billion in 1Q08 increased 15 percent compared to $2.74 billion in 1Q07, primarily the result of a 14 percent increase in average membership.
Medicare stand-alone PDP premiums of $875.0 million in 1Q08 decreased 3 percent compared to $906.4 million in 1Q07, primarily the result of a 10 percent decline in average membership versus that for 1Q07.
Military services premiums and administrative services fees during 1Q08 increased $89.7 million to $831.2 million compared to $741.5 million in 1Q07.
Benefit Expenses:
The Government Segment benefits ratio increased 70 basis points to 90.0 percent in 1Q08 compared to 89.3 percent in the prior years quarter. Improved operating performance year over year in the companys Medicare Advantage and military services businesses was more than offset by the combined effect of significantly higher stand-alone PDP claims, the extra day for leap year, and a minimal impact from the 1Q08 flu season.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segments SG&A expense ratio for 1Q08 of 10.7 percent was 10 basis points lower than that for 1Q07 of 10.8 percent and declined 300 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2007. The declines were primarily driven by leverage associated with higher average Medicare Advantage membership. The sequential decline also reflects lower marketing and other administrative expenses associated with the Medicare selling season for 2008 enrollment which began during 4Q07.
Commercial Segment Results
Pretax results:
Commercial Segment pretax earnings were $127.2 million in 1Q08 compared to $94.4 million in 1Q07. Commercial Segment operating earnings in 1Q07 continue to reflect the companys commitment to underwriting discipline, strategic growth in select medical lines of business, and expanded specialty product offerings.
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership grew 201,200 members to 3,458,700 at March 31, 2008, an increase of 6 percent from March 31, 2007 and essentially unchanged from December 31, 2007. Approximately 95,900 of the year-over-year increase in medical members related to members acquired via an acquisition completed during 4Q07 (primarily ASO members).
Membership in strategic areas of commercial growth rose organically as follows during 1Q08 compared to 1Q07: Individual product membership increased 42 percent, Smart plans and other consumer offerings membership grew 27 percent, and Small Group business membership was up 4 percent.
Membership in Commercial Segment specialty products at March 31, 2008 rose to 6,916,200 compared to 1,935,200 at March 31, 2007, primarily driven by the addition of membership from two specialty-product companies acquired during 4Q07.
(a)
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment increased 14 percent to $1.80 billion in 1Q08 compared to $1.58 billion in the prior years quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of two specialty products companies in 4Q07 and growth in strategic lines of business.
Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully-insured groups increased approximately 2 percent on a per-member basis during 1Q08 compared to 1Q07 reflecting a shift in the mix of fully insured group business from the prior years quarter.
Benefit Expenses:
In 1Q08, the Commercial Segment benefits ratio of 76.8 percent was 260 basis points lower than the 1Q07 benefits ratio of 79.4 percent, primarily reflecting the acquisition of two specialty products companies in 4Q07, continued underwriting discipline and growth in strategic lines of business, partially offset by the extra day for leap year.
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio of 22.3 percent for 1Q08 compares to 20.6 percent in 1Q07, primarily the combined result of a significant year-over-year increase in specialty businesses (including the acquisition of two specialty products companies in 4Q07) together with higher average Individual product membership. Average Individual product membership rose 40 percent versus the prior years quarter.
Balance Sheet
Cash and cash equivalents declined $352.2 million or 17 percent from December 31, 2007 primarily due to the purchase of investments, the repayment of borrowings, and common stock repurchases during 1Q08.
Debt-to-total capitalization at March 31, 2008 was 28.3 percent, down 120 basis points from December 31, 2007.
Days in claims payable of 56.9 at March 31, 2008 reflect a decline of 3.3 days from 60.2 at December 31, 2007, primarily driven by:
An increase in Medicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service claims administered internally in lieu of outsourced to a Medicare fiscal intermediary where claims processing cycles are elongated. (Reduced days in claims payable approximately 1.7 days.)
The impact of benefit levels resetting on January 1 for the Part D component of the companys Medicare Advantage products. This results in benefit expenses increasing sequentially while the corresponding benefits payable generally is unchanged, thus lowering the calculated days in claims payable. (Reduced days in claims payable approximately 1.5 days.)
A sequential increase in the percentage of Medicare Advantage membership in PPO products. Network providers generally submit claims faster than non-network providers, shortening the claims receipt cycle time and allowing for reduced claims processing time overall. (Reduced days in claims payable approximately 0.6 of a day.)
Other factors detailed in the statistical supplement to this release increased days in claims payable by approximately 0.5 of a day.
Share Repurchase Program
On February 22, 2008, the company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the use of up to $150 million for a share repurchase program. As of April 25, 2008, the company had repurchased approximately 1.5 million of its outstanding shares at an average price per share of $45.18.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 1Q08 of $4.4 million compared to cash flows provided by operations of $1.57 billion in 1Q07 primarily reflecting the timing of premium payments from CMS as well as improvements in claims processing cycle times and timing-related changes in other working capital accounts. The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis.
(b)
Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations declined to $4.4 million in 1Q08 from $444.7 million in 1Q07 driven primarily by improvements in claims processing cycle times and timing-related changes in other working capital accounts.
(b)
(b)
Footnotes
The Commercial Segment provides a full range of insured specialty products including dental, vision and other supplemental products. Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products. Other supplemental benefits include life, disability, and fixed-benefit products including cancer and critical illness policies.
(a)
The company believes that the non-GAAP measures included in this release, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
