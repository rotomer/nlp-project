Humana Inc. ("Humana") and certain of its officers and directors (collectively, the " Defendants") have been named as defendants in , Case No. 3:08cv-236-JBC (the " Complaint"), a class action lawsuit filed on May 1, 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, asserting violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). The Complaint asserts claims and allegations similar to those set forth in , Case No. 3:08cv-211-H, a class action filed on April 22, 2008 in the Western District of Kentucky, which is disclosed in note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements of Humana included in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29, 2008. The Complaint is brought on behalf of a purported class of participants in and beneficiaries of the Humana Retirement and Savings Plan and the Humana Puerto Rico 1165(e) Retirement Plan (collectively, the "Plans"). The Complaint alleges, among other things, that, from September 1, 2007 through May 1, 2008, some or all of the Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Plans by: (i) offering Humana common stock as an investment option for the Plans and invested the Plans' assets in Humana common stock, even though they knew or should have known that Humana common stock was not a suitable and appropriate investment option; (ii) providing participants with misleading information and failed to provide complete and accurate information regarding Humana common stock, including information regarding Humana's stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans; (iii) failing to properly monitor the Plans' fiduciaries; and (iv) failing to avoid conflicts of interest and to serve the interests of the Plans' participants and beneficiaries. The Complaint also alleges that certain Defendants are liable for those breaches as co-fiduciaries because they enabled, knowingly participated in, and/or knew of and failed to remedy those breaches. The Complaint seeks the following relief, among other things: (i) repayment of alleged losses to the Plans, restoration of profits that the Defendants allegedly made using Plan assets, and restoration of Plan participants' lost profits; (ii) an injunction prohibiting future violations of the Defendants' fiduciary obligations under ERISA; (iii) actual damages; (iv) allocation of the Plans' recovery to any participants' accounts that invested in Humana common stock in proportion to the accounts' losses caused by the decline in the Humana common stock; (v) an award of plaintiffs' legal fees and costs; and (vi) equitable restitution and other equitable and injunctive relief, including modifying the Plans to prevent further violations of ERISA.

In addition, Humana and certain other companies in the health insurance industry (collectively, the " Defendants") have been named as defendants in , Case No. 3:08-cv-00654-CFD (the "Complaint"), a class action lawsuit filed on April 29, 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut asserting violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") (18 U.S.C.  1962(c)), Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C.  1), and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (C.G.S.  42-110b). The Complaint alleges, among other things, that, during the period beginning at least as early as January 1, 2004 through April 29, 2008, the Defendants conspired to fix the rates at which they reimbursed their health plan members for costs of services received from out-of-network health care providers by, among

other things, (i) manipulating the "reasonable and customary rates" that they used to calculate reimbursement rates, (ii) using data supplied by Ingenix, Inc. regarding reasonable and customary rates that they knew was flawed and had been manipulated, and (iii) concealing these facts from their plan members. The Complaint alleges that, as a result of these actions, the Defendants artificially depressed their reimbursement rates for out-of-network services and caused their members to pay a greater share of the costs of those services than they otherwise would have paid. The Complaint seeks, among other things, the following relief: (i) an award of monetary damages, including disgorgement, and treble and punitive damages; (ii) an injunction prohibiting the Defendants from continuing the alleged unlawful activities; (iii) an award of plaintiff's legal fees and costs; and (iv) other relief that the court deems just and proper.
