Item 1.01.   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 2, 2008, Humana Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. as representatives of the several underwriters (together, the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7.20% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "2018 Senior Notes") at a purchase price of 99.891% of the aggregate principal amount thereof and $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 8.15% Senior Notes due 2038 (the "2038 Senior Notes" and, together with the 2018 Senior Notes, the "Senior Notes") at a purchase price of 99.917% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
The sale of the Senior Notes has been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in a registration statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-132878 (the "Registration Statement"). The terms of the Senior Notes are described in the Company's Prospectus dated March 31, 2006, as supplemented by a final Prospectus Supplement dated June 2, 2008, as filed with the Commission on June 3, 2008, pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The closing of the sale of the Senior Notes is expected to occur on or about June 5, 2008, subject to customary closing conditions. The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes, after deducting the Underwriters' discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $741.8 million.
The Underwriters have performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and expenses. The Underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business. In addition, affiliates of certain of the Underwriters are lenders under our credit facility, and thus will receive a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes that are used to repay borrowings under the credit facility.
A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein. The description of the material terms of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.
Item 8.01.   Other Events.
The Company is also filing as Exhibit 12.1 the computation of its ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each of the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and for the three months ended March 31, 2008, and the pro forma calculation of its ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and the three months ended March 31, 2008 after giving effect to the issuance of the Senior Notes and the use of the proceeds from this issuance.

(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of the Notes), to which that Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing
 
Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Notes or the offering contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (that the Company shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent that it is determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by such Underwriter through its negligence or willful misconduct), and shall reimburse each Underwriter and each such director, officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any such amendment or supplement, or in such Blue Sky Application in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriters' Information. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any director, officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter.
provided
provided, however
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Underwriters' Information, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer, employee or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend
 
against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure; and, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , that the Representatives shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Representatives and those other Underwriters and their respective directors, officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under this Section 8 if, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, it is advisable for the Representatives and those Underwriters, directors, officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

provided, however
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Notes purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company acknowledges that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Notes by the Underwriters set forth in the last paragraph on the cover page of, and the fifth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (the "Underwriters' Information").
9. . If, on the Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on the Delivery Date in the respective proportions which the aggregate principal amount of Notes set opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto bears to the total aggregate principal amount of Notes set opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto; , that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes on the Delivery Date if the total aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on the Delivery Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes which it agreed to purchase on the Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 2. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Notes to be purchased on the Delivery Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives do not elect to purchase Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on the Delivery Date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses of the non-defaulting Underwriters to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 11. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule 1 hereto who, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases the Notes which a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriters
provided, however
Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company for damages caused by its default. If other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Notes of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Company may postpone the Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.
 
10. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes if, prior to that time, (i) any of the events described in Sections 7(j), 7(k) and 7(l) shall have occurred, (ii) the representation in Section 1(g) is incorrect in any respect, or (iii) the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement.
Termination.
11. If the Company shall fail to tender the Notes for delivery to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed (other than with respect to a termination pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 10 if the Company and the Underwriters subsequently enter into another agreement for the Underwriters to underwrite the same or substantially similar securities of the Company), or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Notes, and upon demand the Company shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representatives. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.
