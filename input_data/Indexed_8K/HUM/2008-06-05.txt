"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a related Rating Event.
"Common Stock" means, with respect to any Principal Subsidiary, Capital Stock of any class, however designated, except Capital Stock which is non-participating beyond fixed dividend and liquidation preferences and the holders of which have either no voting rights or limited voting rights entitling them, only in the case of certain contingencies, to elect less than a majority of the directors (or persons

"Rating Event" means (i) the rating of the 2018 Senior Notes is lowered by both Rating Agencies during the related Trigger Period and (ii) the 2018 Senior Notes are rated below an Investment Grade rating by both Rating Agencies on any day during such Trigger Period. If either Rating Agency is not providing a rating of the 2018 Senior Notes on any day during such Trigger Period for any reason, the rating of such Rating Agency shall be deemed to be below Investment Grade on such day and such Rating Agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the 2018 Senior Notes during the Trigger Period.
"Standard & Poor's" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or any successor thereto.

Section 314. .
Interest Rate Adjustment
Interest on the 2018 Senior Notes shall be subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 314.
(a) If the rating from Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof of the 2018 Senior Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the table in this Section 314(a), the interest rate on 2018 Senior Notes shall increase from the interest rate payable on the 2018 Senior Notes on the Issue Date by the percentage points set forth opposite that rating:
 
(b) If the rating from Standard & Poor's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof of the 2018 Senior Notes is decreased to a rating set forth in the table in this Section 314(b), the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes shall increase from the interest rate payable on the 2018 Senior Notes on the Issue Date by the percentage points set forth opposite that rating:
 
 
(c) If at any time the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes has been adjusted upward pursuant to Section 314(a) or 314(b) and either Moody's or Standard & Poor's (or, in either case, a Substitute Rating Agency thereof), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the 2018 Senior Notes to any of the ratings set forth in the table in either Section 314(a) or 314(b), as applicable, the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate for the 2018 Senior Notes equals the interest rate payable on the 2018 Senior Notes on the Issue Date plus the applicable percentage points set forth opposite the ratings in the tables in either 314(a) or 314(b), as applicable, in effect immediately following the increase.
(d) If Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof subsequently increases its rating of the 2018 Senior Notes to Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and Standard & Poor's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes shall be decreased to the interest rate payable on the 2018 Senior Notes on the Issue Date.
(e) Each adjustment required by Section 314(a), 314(b) or 314(c) shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments.
(f) In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes be reduced to below 7.20% or (2) the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes exceed 9.20%.
(g) Except as provided in clause (h) below, no adjustments in the interest rate of the 2018 Senior Notes shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating of the 2018 Senior Notes. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the 2018 Senior Notes for a reason beyond the Company's control, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the 2018 Senior Notes from a Substitute Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute Rating Agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes pursuant to Section 314(a), Section 314(b), Section 314(c) or Section 314(d), (i) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the 2018 Senior Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (ii) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt shall be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing
 
appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in Section 314(a) or Section 314(b) with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or Standard & Poor's, as applicable, in Section 314(a) or Section 314(b) and (iii) the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the 2018 Senior Notes on the Issue Date the appropriate percentage points, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in Section 314(a) or Section 314(b), as applicable, (taking into account the provisions of clause (ii) above) ( any applicable percentage points resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency). For so long as only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the 2018 Senior Notes, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the 2018 Senior Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by such Rating Agency shall be twice the percentage points set forth in Section 314(a) or Section 314(b), as applicable.
plus
plus
(h) For so long as no Rating Agency provides a rating of the 2018 Senior Notes, the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 9.20%.
(i) The interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described in this Section 314 (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both Rating Agencies) if the 2018 Senior Notes become rated A3 and A- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, respectively (or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency thereof), or one of these ratings if the 2018 Senior Notes are only rated by one Rating Agency.
(j) Any interest rate increase or decrease described in this Section 314 will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. If Moody's or Standard & Poor's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof changes its rating of the 2018 Senior Notes more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency during such period will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease with respect to the 2018 Senior Notes pursuant to this Section 314 relating to such Rating Agency's action.
(k) The Company shall advise the Trustee and Paying Agent of any adjustment to the interest rate on the 2018 Senior Notes in accordance with this Section 314.

CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 7.20% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes"). The Notes are one of an indefinite number of series of debt securities of the Company (the "Securities"), issued or issuable under and pursuant to a base indenture, dated as of August 5, 2003 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to The Bank of New York) (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a third supplemental indenture, dated as of June 5, 2008 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture"; the Base Indenture as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture is herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (other than supplemental indentures creating a different series of notes) reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of the Notes are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. This Note is one of a series designated on the face hereof initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000. The Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the Holders, issue and sell additional Securities ranking equally with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects (except for their date of issue, issue price and, if applicable, the first payment of interest on the additional notes) so that such additional Securities shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes.
The terms of other series of Securities issued under the Base Indenture may vary with respect to interest rates or interest rate formulas, issue dates, maturity, redemption, repayment, currency of payment and otherwise as provided in the Base Indenture. The Base Indenture further provides that Securities of a single series may be issued at various times, with different maturity dates and may bear interest at different rates. All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture, with respect to the Company) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series then Outstanding may declare the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest thereon shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
ipso
facto
This Note may be redeemed at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at the option of the Company (such date of redemption, the "Optional Redemption Date") at the Redemption Price (as defined below) together with interest accrued thereon to the Optional Redemption Date.
The "Redemption Price" shall equal the greater of:
 
 
The Notes called for redemption become due on the Optional Redemption Date. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Optional Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Notes will state the amount to be redeemed. On and after the Optional Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on any Notes that are redeemed. If less than all the Notes are redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes on a pro rata basis or by any other method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
For purposes of determining the Redemption Price, the following definitions are applicable:
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Company for that Optional Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or, if the Company is unable to obtain at least four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Company.
"Independent Investment Banker" means either Banc of America Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as selected by the Company or, if both such firms are unwilling or unable to select the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer") selected by the Independent Investment Banker; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Optional Redemption Date for the Notes, an average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue for the Notes, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Trustee by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Optional Redemption Date.
"Treasury Yield" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity, computed as of the third business day immediately preceding the Optional Redemption Date, of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, equal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for the Optional Redemption Date.
As provided in the Indenture, the Notes shall be subject to repurchase by the Company or a third party at the option of the Holders at a purchase price of 101% upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event. Upon receipt of notice of a Change of Control Offer, Holders electing to have Notes repurchased pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall either (i) surrender this Note with the form of "Option of Holder to Elect Repurchase" attached hereto completed or (ii) transfer its Notes to the Paying Agent by book-entry transfer pursuant to the applicable procedures of the Paying Agent, in either case prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series issued under the Indenture to be affected thereby, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of such series; that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or interest thereon, if any, or any premium payable upon redemption thereof; or (ii) change the Place of Payment on any Security or the currency or currency unit in which any Security or the principal or interest thereon is payable; (iii) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof; (iv) reduce or alter the method of computation of any amount payable upon redemption, repayment or purchase of any Securities by the Company (or the time when such redemption, repayment or purchase may be made); or (v) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of that series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series, except a default in the payment of principal of or interest, if any, on any Security of that series or a default with respect to a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be amended without the consent of such Holder.
provided, however,
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes shall be initially issued in the form of a Global Security. All payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Notes will be made to the Trustee so long as the Notes are in the form of a Global Security. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. If (x) the Depositary is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company delivers to the Trustee a Company Order to the effect that this Note shall be exchangeable or (z) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes, this Note shall be exchangeable for Notes in definitive form and in an equal aggregate principal amount. Such definitive Notes shall be registered in such name or names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein and above, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provisions of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Notes, as provided in the Indenture.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any), or the interest, if any, on this Note, or for any claim based thereon, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment of penalty or otherwise; and all such personal liability is expressly released and waived as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the issuance of this Note.
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

If either Rating Agency is not providing a rating of the 2038 Senior Notes on any day during such Trigger Period for any reason, the rating of such Rating Agency shall be deemed to be below Investment Grade on such day and such Rating Agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the 2038 Senior Notes during the Trigger Period.

(d) If Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof subsequently increases its rating of the 2038 Senior Notes to Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and Standard & Poor's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the 2038 Senior Notes shall be decreased to the interest rate payable on the 2038 Senior Notes on the Issue Date.
(e) Each adjustment required by Section 314(a), 314(b) or 314(c) shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments.
(f) In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the 2038 Senior Notes be reduced to below 8.15% or (2) the interest rate on the 2038 Senior Notes exceed 10.15%.
(g) Except as provided in clause (h) below, no adjustments in the interest rate of the 2038 Senior Notes shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating of the 2038 Senior Notes. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the 2038 Senior Notes for a reason beyond the Company's control, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the 2038 Senior Notes from a Substitute Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute Rating Agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the 2038 Senior Notes pursuant to Section 314(a), Section 314(b), Section 314(c) or Section 314(d), (i) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the 2038 Senior Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (ii) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt shall be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing
 
appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in Section 314(a) or Section 314(b) with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or Standard & Poor's, as applicable, in Section 314(a) or Section 314(b) and (iii) the interest rate on the 2038 Senior Notes will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the 2038 Senior Notes on the Issue Date the appropriate percentage points, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in Section 314(a) or Section 314(b), as applicable, (taking into account the provisions of clause (ii) above) ( any applicable percentage points resulting from a decreased rating by the other Rating Agency). For so long as only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the 2038 Senior Notes, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the 2038 Senior Notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by such Rating Agency shall be twice the percentage points set forth in Section 314(a) or Section 314(b), as applicable.
plus
plus
(h) For so long as no Rating Agency provides a rating of the 2038 Senior Notes, the interest rate on the 2038 Senior Notes will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 10.15 %.
(i) The interest rate on the 2038 Senior Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described in this Section 314 (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both Rating Agencies) if the 2038 Senior Notes become rated A3 and A- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, respectively (or, in either case, any Substitute Rating Agency thereof), or one of these ratings if the 2038 Senior Notes are only rated by one Rating Agency.
(j) Any interest rate increase or decrease described in this Section 314 will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. If Moody's or Standard & Poor's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof changes its rating of the 2038 Senior Notes more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency during such period will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease with respect to the 2038 Senior Notes pursuant to this Section 314 relating to such Rating Agency's action.
(k) The Company shall advise the Trustee and Paying Agent of any adjustment to the interest rate on the 2038 Senior Notes in accordance with this Section 314.

Notice of Default
(5) the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries shall commence any case or proceeding seeking to have an order for relief entered on its behalf as debtor or to adjudicate it as bankrupt or insolvent or seeking reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, arrangement, composition or readjustment of its debts or any other relief under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, arrangement, composition, readjustment of debt or other similar act or law of any jurisdiction, domestic or foreign, now or hereafter existing; or the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries shall apply for a receiver, custodian or trustee (other than any trustee appointed as a mortgagee or secured party in connection with the issuance of indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company) of it or for all or a substantial part of its
 
property; or the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries shall take any corporate action in furtherance of any of the foregoing; or

If an Event of Default with respect to the 2038 Senior Notes and any related coupons occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(5) or 501(6) with respect to the Company), then and in every such case either the Trustee for the 2038 Senior Notes or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding 2038 Senior Notes may declare the entire principal amount of all the 2038 Senior Notes, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to such Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration of acceleration such principal, together with accrued interest and all other amounts owing hereunder, shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived.
If any Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest on all Securities of each series then outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.

CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 8.15% Senior Notes due 2038 (the "Notes"). The Notes are one of an indefinite number of series of debt securities of the Company (the "Securities"), issued or issuable under and pursuant to a base indenture, dated as of August 5, 2003 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to The Bank of New York) (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a fourth supplemental indenture, dated as of June 5, 2008 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture"; the Base Indenture as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture is herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (other than supplemental indentures creating a different series of notes) reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of the Notes are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. This Note is one of a series designated on the face hereof initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000. The Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the Holders, issue and sell additional Securities ranking equally with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects (except for their date of issue, issue price and, if applicable, the first payment of interest on the additional notes) so that such additional Securities shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes.
The terms of other series of Securities issued under the Base Indenture may vary with respect to interest rates or interest rate formulas, issue dates, maturity, redemption, repayment, currency of payment and otherwise as provided in the Base Indenture. The Base Indenture further provides that Securities of a single series may be issued at various times, with different maturity dates and may bear interest at different rates. All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture, with respect to the Company) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series then Outstanding may declare the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest thereon shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
ipso facto
This Note may be redeemed at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at the option of the Company (such date of redemption, the "Optional Redemption Date") at the Redemption Price (as defined below) together with interest accrued thereon to the Optional Redemption Date.
The "Redemption Price" shall equal the greater of:
 
 
The Notes called for redemption become due on the Optional Redemption Date. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Optional Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Notes will state the amount to be redeemed. On and after the Optional Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on any Notes that are redeemed. If less than all the Notes are redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes on a pro rata basis or by any other method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.
For purposes of determining the Redemption Price, the following definitions are applicable:
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Company for that Optional Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or, if the Company is unable to obtain at least four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Company.
"Independent Investment Banker" means either Banc of America Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as selected by the Company or, if both such firms are unwilling or unable to select the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer") selected by the Independent Investment Banker; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Optional Redemption Date for the Notes, an average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue for the Notes, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Trustee by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Optional Redemption Date.
"Treasury Yield" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity, computed as of the third business day immediately preceding the Optional Redemption Date, of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, equal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for the Optional Redemption Date.
As provided in the Indenture, the Notes shall be subject to repurchase by the Company or a third party at the option of the Holders at a purchase price of 101% upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event. Upon receipt of notice of a Change of Control Offer, Holders electing to have Notes repurchased pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall either (i) surrender this Note with the form of "Option of Holder to Elect Repurchase" attached hereto completed or (ii) transfer its Notes to the Paying Agent by book-entry transfer pursuant to the applicable procedures of the Paying Agent, in either case prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series issued under the Indenture to be affected thereby, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of such series; that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or interest thereon, if any, or any premium payable upon redemption thereof; or (ii) change the Place of Payment on any Security or the currency or currency unit in which any Security or the principal or interest thereon is payable; (iii) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof; (iv) reduce or alter the method of computation of any amount payable upon redemption, repayment or purchase of any Securities by the Company (or the time when such redemption, repayment or purchase may be made); or (v) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of that series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series, except a default in the payment of principal of or interest, if any, on any Security of that series or a default with respect to a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be amended without the consent of such Holder.
provided, however,
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes shall be initially issued in the form of a Global Security. All payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Notes will be made to the Trustee so long as the Notes are in the form of a Global Security. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

Exhibit 99
release
news
 
 
LOUISVILLE, KY (June 5, 2008)  Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) announced today the completion of its public offerings of $500 million of its 7.20 percent Senior Notes, due June 15, 2018, at 99.891 percent of the principal amount ("2018 Senior Notes") and $250 million of its 8.15 percent Senior Notes, due June 15, 2038, at 99.917 percent of the principal amount ("2038 Senior Notes"). Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as the joint book running managers for both the 2018 Senior Notes and the 2038 Senior Notes (collectively, "Senior Notes Offerings").
The net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offerings will be used to repay outstanding borrowings under the company's unsecured revolving credit agreement ("Credit Agreement"). At May 30, 2008, borrowings outstanding in connection with the Credit Agreement was $750 million.
Contemporaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes Offerings, the company also entered into interest-rate swap agreements ("Swaps") with major financial institutions which mature concurrent with and have the same critical terms as the Senior Notes Offerings. The Swaps have the effect of converting the fixed interest rates on the Senior Notes Offerings to variable interest rates with the expected result that net interest expense changes will correspond closely to changes in net investment income, thus mitigating any impact upon diluted earnings per common share.
