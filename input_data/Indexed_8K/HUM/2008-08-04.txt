Exhibit 99
Humana Reports Second Quarter Financial Results;
Increases Projected 2008 EPS;
Provides Updates on Acquisition and Share Repurchase Activity
$1.24 EPS for second quarter ahead of managements expectations
Full year 2008 EPS now projected in the range of $4.30 to $4.40
Signed definitive agreement to acquire Cariten Healthcare
Share repurchase authorization increased to $250 million
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 (2Q08) including diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $1.24 compared to $1.28 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 (2Q07). The 2Q08 results were ahead of managements previous guidance for EPS of $1.15 to $1.20, primarily due to better-than-anticipated financial results for the companys stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) offerings.
For the six months ended June 30, 2008 (1H08) the company reported $1.71 in EPS compared to $1.70 for the six months ended June 30, 2007 (1H07). The companys Commercial Segment operating performance improved year-over-year while improved operating performance in the Government Segments Medicare Advantage business was more than offset by the previously announced PDP operating shortfall.
We had a good quarter across all our lines of business and with our PDP issue playing out better than expected, weve raised EPS guidance for the year and are well positioned for a strong 2009, said Michael B. McCallister, Humanas president and chief executive officer of Humana.
In light of the better-than-anticipated second quarter results, the company now anticipates achieving EPS for the year ending December 31, 2008 (FY08) in the range of $4.30 to $4.40, up from its previous guidance of $4.10 to $4.35.
 2Q08 consolidated revenues rose 14 percent to $7.35 billion from $6.43 billion in 2Q07, with total premium and administrative services fees also up 14 percent compared to the prior years quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher average membership in 2Q08 versus 2Q07 for the companys Medicare Advantage, Commercial medical and specialty products as well as higher premium yields for the companys Medicare Advantage products.
Revenues
1H08 consolidated revenues rose 13 percent to $14.31 billion from $12.63 billion in 1H07 with total premium and administrative services fees up 13 percent compared to the prior years period, also driven primarily by similar increases in average enrollment and premium yields as those affecting the year-over-year comparisons for 2Q08.
 The 2Q08 consolidated benefits ratio (benefit expenses as a percent of premium revenues) was higher than that for the prior years quarter, as expected. The 2Q08 consolidated benefits ratio of 85.0 percent compares to 83.4 percent in 2Q07. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by a 200 basis point increase in the Government Segment benefits ratio associated with higher PDP claim expenses.
Benefit expenses
The consolidated benefits ratio for 1H08 of 85.8 percent was 70 basis points higher than the 1H07 consolidated benefits ratio of 85.1 percent with a 140 basis points increase in this year-to-date metric for the Government Segment outpacing the 110 basis point improvement year to date in the benefits ratio for the Commercial Segment.
 The 2Q08 consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums, administrative services fees and other revenue) declined 40 basis points to 12.6 percent for 2Q08 from 13.0 percent in 2Q07. The year-over-year improvement reflects the combined result of declines in the SG&A expense ratio for both of the companys business segments.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
The SG&A expense ratio for 1H08 of 13.2 percent was unchanged from that for 1H07 of 13.2 percent as a 70 basis point increase in this metric for the Commercial Segment was essentially offset by a 30 basis point improvement in the SG&A expense ratio for the Government Segment.
Government Segment Results
Pretax results:
Primarily as a result of less favorable 2008 PDP operating results, 2Q08 Government Segment pretax earnings were lower than 2Q07, with pretax income of $249.4 million in 2Q08 compared to $288.8 million in 2Q07. The year-over-year decline in operating performance was partially offset by improved operating performance in the companys Medicare Advantage business.
For 1H08, pretax earnings for the Government Segment of $246.2 million declined by 20 percent versus 1H07 pretax earnings for the segment of $306.7 million, also primarily reflecting the less favorable performance year over year in the companys stand-alone PDP business, partially offset by improved Medicare Advantage performance.
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership grew to 1,345,000 at June 30, 2008, an increase of 211,300 members, or 19 percent from June 30, 2007, up 77,300, or 6 percent versus March 31, 2008, and 202,000 members, or 18 percent year to date. Net Medicare Advantage membership gains for 2Q08 include 40,700 members from acquisitions completed during the quarter.
Membership in the companys stand-alone PDPs totaled 3,105,200 at June 30, 2008 compared to 3,440,100 at June 30, 2007 and 3,150,200 at March 31, 2008.
Military services membership at June 30, 2008 of 2,943,800 was up approximately 3 percent from June 30, 2007 and essentially unchanged from March 31, 2008.
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Medicare Advantage premiums of $3.49 billion in 2Q08 increased 25 percent compared to $2.80 billion in 2Q07, primarily the combined result of a 17 percent increase in average membership and higher per member premium revenues.
Medicare stand-alone PDP premiums of $905.1 million in 2Q08 decreased 14 percent compared to $1.05 billion in 2Q07, primarily the result of a 10 percent decline in average membership versus that for 2Q07.
Military services premiums and administrative services fees during 2Q08 increased $83.8 million to $824.4 million compared to $740.6 million in 2Q07.
Benefit Expenses:
The Government Segment benefits ratio increased 200 basis points to 86.3 percent in 2Q08 compared to 84.3 percent in the prior years quarter. As previously noted, improved operating performance year over year in the companys Medicare Advantage business was more than offset by an increase in the stand-alone PDP benefits ratio.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segments SG&A expense ratio for 2Q08 of 9.5 percent was 50 basis points lower than that for 2Q07 of 10.0 percent and improved 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2008. The improvements were primarily driven by leverage associated with higher average Medicare Advantage membership and increased Medicare premium yields. The sequential improvement also reflects lower marketing and other administrative expenses associated with the Medicare selling season for 2008 enrollment which concluded during the first quarter of 2008.
Commercial Segment Results
Pretax results:
Commercial Segment pretax earnings increased 49 percent year over year, to $75.6 million in 2Q08 compared to $50.8 million in 2Q07. This favorable performance was produced by continued strength in the companys areas of strategic Commercial focus  individual, small-group, ASO and consumer plans  as well as overall underwriting discipline and growth from specialty-product acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007.
The segments 40 percent increase in pretax earnings for 1H08 ($202.7 million versus $145.2 million in 1H07) was also primarily attributable to the factors outlined above.
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership grew 279,800 members to 3,558,500 at June 30, 2008, an increase of 9 percent from the June 30, 2007 medical membership for the segment of 3,278,700 and up 3 percent year to date. On an organic basis, Commercial Segment medical membership grew 120,800 members, or 4 percent year-over-year and 43,800 members, or 1 percent year to date.
Organic medical membership growth in strategic commercial lines of business for 2Q08 compared to 2Q07 were as follows: HumanaOne membership increased 45 percent, Smart plans and other consumer offerings membership grew 23 percent, Small Group business membership increased 13 percent and ASO membership was essentially unchanged.
Membership in Commercial Segment specialty products at June 30, 2008 rose to 6,744,400 compared to 1,930,000 at June 30, 2007, primarily driven by the addition of membership from two specialty-product companies acquired during the fourth quarter of 2007. Specialty membership was essentially unchanged from December 31, 2007.
(a)
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment increased 17 percent to $1.85 billion in 2Q08 compared to $1.59 billion in the prior years quarter, primarily due to revenues associated with acquired companies and growth in strategic lines of business.
Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully-insured groups increased approximately 2 percent on a per-member basis during 2Q08 compared to 2Q07 reflecting a shift in the mix of fully-insured group business from the prior years quarter to include less groups with higher-than-average premiums.
Benefit Expenses:
The Commercial Segment benefits ratio for 1H08 improved 110 basis points year over year, primarily reflecting the impact of specialty product acquisitions, together with continued underwriting discipline. In 2Q08, the benefits ratio of 81.0 percent was 30 basis points higher than the 2Q07 benefits ratio of 80.7 percent, primarily due to the 2Q07 benefits ratio including a modest impact of favorable prior period development related to 1Q07 medical claims estimates. The first two quarters of 2008 more precisely reflect the sequential claims patterns for the companys growing book of high-deductible health plans.
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio of 21.5 percent for 2Q08 compares to 21.8 percent in 2Q07, primarily driven by leverage associated with an 8 percent increase in average Commercial medical membership as well as higher specialty product membership acquired via transactions that closed in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Balance Sheet
Cash and cash equivalents of $1.17 billion at June 30, 2008 declined $513.6 million from March 31, 2008 primarily due to the completion of two acquisitions, ordinary course cash transfers into investment securities, and share repurchases during 2Q08.
Parent company cash and investments decreased to $171.5 million at June 30, 2008 from $535.7 million at December 31, 2007. In addition to the completion of two acquisitions and share repurchases during 1H08, the parent company received dividends from operating subsidiaries of $296.0 million versus $377.0 million in 1H07, primarily attributable to lower-than-anticipated dividends from entities operating stand-alone PDPs.
Net premiums receivable at June 30, 2008 of $987.1 million were up $239.3 million from March 31, 2008 primarily due to an increase in certain Medicare premiums receivable. The company collected the related $257.4 million balance outstanding on that receivable at June 30, 2008 in July 2008.
Days in claims payable of 57.2 at June 30, 2008 reflect an increase of 0.3 days from 56.9 at March 31, 2008.
Debt-to-total capitalization at June 30, 2008 was 28.0 percent, down 30 basis points from 28.3 percent at March 31, 2008. During 2Q08 the company completed an aggregate offering of $750 million of senior notes, the net proceeds of which were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the companys $1.00 billion bank credit agreement.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 2Q08 of $104.0 million compared to cash flows provided by operations of $477.3 million in 2Q07 primarily reflecting changes in working capital accounts. Net premiums receivable at June 30, 2008 of $987.1 million were up $239.3 million from March 31, 2008 primarily due to an increase in certain Medicare premiums receivable. The company collected the related $257.4 million balance outstanding on that receivable at June 30, 2008 in July 2008.
The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis.
(b)
Non-GAAP cash flows provided by operations declined to $104.0 million in 2Q08 from $431.7 million in 2Q07 also driven primarily by the changes in working capital accounts described above.

(b)
Acquisition Activity
The company also announced today that it had signed a definitive agreement to purchase PHP Companies, Inc. (d/b/a Cariten Healthcare) (Cariten), from Knoxville, Tennessee-based Covenant Health for cash consideration of approximately $245 million. The transaction is anticipated to close during the fourth quarter of 2008 and is not anticipated to materially affect Humanas earnings guidance for the FY08.
During 2Q08 the company also announced its intent to acquire Metcare Health Plans, Inc. (Metcare) in Florida and completed its acquisitions of the SecureHorizons Medicare Advantage HMO business in Las Vegas, Nevada and OSF Health Plans in Illinois.
Share Repurchase Program
In February 2008, the companys Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $150 million for share repurchases. As of August 1, 2008, the company had repurchased approximately 2.1 million of its outstanding shares at an average price per share of $44.19 and had approximately $57.2 million remaining on the February 2008 authorization.
The company also announced today that its Board of Directors had increased the companys share repurchase authorization for use of up to $250 million for this program, excluding the $92.8 million used year to date in connection with the February 2008 authorization.
