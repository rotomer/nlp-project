LOUISVILLE, Ky.  September 30, 2008  Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today announced it is assisting the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in providing uninterrupted access to health and prescription benefits for approximately 16,000 Medicare members of the MD Medicare Choice (MDMC) plan in 23 counties across Florida effective October 1, 2008.
MDMC's contract with CMS was terminated following action September 29, 2008 by the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Court in and for Leon County, Florida, which placed MDMC into receivership. The Florida Department of Financial Services immediately began a liquidation of the plan.
"Humana and our vast network of primary care doctors, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies welcome MDMC's members to our organization," said Michael A. Seltzer, CEO of Humana Medicare and Medicaid in South Florida. "Humana has a long and proven history of being a trusted provider for more than 450,000 seniors throughout Florida. We work very hard to offer our members guidance, exceptional service and first-class benefits. We look forward to the opportunity of building a lasting and trusting relationship with our new members."
MDMC members will be enrolled in a comparable Humana Medicare plan and will receive medical and prescription drug benefits similar to the benefits they received through MDMC. A dedicated Humana customer care team has been set up to work with these Medicare beneficiaries should they have questions about this change.
