This contract extension adds one additional one-year option period, Option Period VI (April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010) and two additional 6 month option periods, Option Period VII (April 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010) and Option Period VIII (October 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011). The addition of Option Periods VI, VII, and VIII to this contract does not commit the Government to the exercise of these options. In addition this modification updates the contract terms and conditions to incorporate the three (3) additional option periods and align the clauses governing this extension with the latest version of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). This modification also incorporates the Small Business Subcontracting Plan for Option Period VI, VII, and VIII dated January 8, 2009.
B.
SLIN 0508AE price is hereby changed from $ **** to $ **** . This correction is necessary, because modification no. P00496 incorrectly added $**** to the value of SLIN 0508AE and P00508 incorrectly added $**** to the value of SLIN 0508AE resulting in an overstatement of the contract price by $**** . This error effected modifications P00496, P00499, P00501, P00508 and P00517 which were incorrectly priced.
C.

4. :
Section H of the contract is modified as follows
Through out Section H, all references to Option Periods "one", "two", "three", "four", and "five" are corrected to reflect roman numerals "I", "II", "III", "IV", and "V" respectively.
Subsection H.1.b.(2)(b) adds instructions on target health care cost for Option Periods VI, VII and VIII by changing the second sentence of paragraph (b) to read as follows:
"The negotiation process shall begin with the submission of a proposal by the contractor not later than the first day of the seventh month of Option Period I through VI with VII and VIII combined into one negotiation period."
Subsection H.1.b.(3) adds the following text to the first paragraph and adds paragraph 2:
"For Option Period VI through VIII the fall-back process is retained, but the dollar amount for use in the fall-back" formula established at contract award is determined as follows:
For option VI, the fixed target fee to be used in the fall-back formula would be set at the level of the option V negotiated target fee (as modified by any subsequent change-orders not already considered in the negotiated amount) accelerated to option VI at the same annual rate as proposed by HMHS for the acceleration of its fixed-fee amounts from option II through option V (8.0%). For option VII, which is a six-month Option Period, the fixed fee amount would be set at half of the option VI fixed fee, accelerated at the same annual rate for a period of 9 months (from the mid-point of option VI, to the mid-point of option VII), resulting in a multiplicative factor of .5297 from option VI to option VII. For option VIII, which is also a six-month Option Period, the option VII fixed fee would be accelerated at the same annual rate for an additional six months (from the mid-point of option VII to the mid-point of option VIII), resulting in a multiplicative factor of 1.0392 from option VII to VIII. The multiplicative factors will be rounded to four decimal places. Based on this procedure and the current negotiated target fee for option V ($****), the following fixed-fee amounts would apply for option VI - $**** , option VII - $**** and option VIII - $**** ."
Subsection H.1.b.(5)(c) changes the Option Period end date to OP VIII by changing the first sentence as follow:
"The final determination of fee will occur approximately 12 to 18 months after the end of the Option Period to which it applies. This final determination will be based on underwritten TEDs accepted by TMA through the ninth month (Option Periods I and II) and through the sixth month (Option Periods III through VIII), after the end of the Option Period."
Subsection H.8.c. adds the performance guarantee amounts for OP VI, VII, and VIII as follows:
 
Subsection H.9. updates the award fee quarterly pool by changing the first and second sentence as follows:
"The award fee will be administered quarterly following the completion of each contract quarter in accordance with the award fee plan. The award fee pool is prorated into two quarters in Option Periods I, VII and VIII and into four equal amounts for the option years II through VI as shown in Section B."
Subsection H.11.b.(1)(a) section title is deleted in its entirety and replaced with subsection (a) title as follows:
"(a) Sampling Methodology and Application of Results for Option Period I"
 
 
 
Subsection H.11.b.(1)(a), the seventh sentence is deleted in its entirety and replaced as follows:
"Samples will be drawn from those underwritten TED records which are fully or provisionally accepted, with end dates of service in the option period, through the ninth month after the end of option period I."
Subsection H.11.b.(1) (b) is deleted in its entirety and replaced with subsection (b) as follows:
"(b) Sampling Methodology and Application of Results for Option Periods II through VIII
For Option Periods II through VIII, the same sampling methodology will be used as described in Section H.11.b.(1) (a) above for Option Period I. For Option Period II, samples will be drawn from underwritten TED records which are fully or provisionally accepted, with end dates of service in the option period through the ninth month. For Option Periods III through VI, samples will be drawn from underwritten TED records with end dates of service in the respective option period, and which are fully or provisionally accepted into the TMA database through the sixth month after the end of the option period.
For Option Periods VII and VIII, a single audit will be performed. If only OP VII is exercised an audit will be drawn from underwritten TED records with end dates of service in OP VII. Should the Government exercise OP VIII then an audit sample will be drawn from underwritten TED records with end dates of service in both OP VII and OP VIII. Samples for OP VII and OP VIII will be drawn from underwritten TED records which are fully or provisionally accepted into the TMA database through the sixth month following the end of the last exercised Option Period.
For Option Periods III through VIII, the Government will draw the sample no later than seven (7) months after the end of the respective option period. The Government reserves its rights to perform specific and/or more frequent audits than annual. Records to be sampled will be "net" records (i.e. the sum of the option period transaction records available through the sixth month after the end of the option period). The total overpayment recovery amount for each option period will be determined based on the lower bound of a one-sided ninety-percent (90%) confidence interval. At the same time the sample list is issued to the contractor the Government shall provide a complete listing of all TED records that encompass the audit universe for each respective Option Period. The contractor must identify all TED records that it believes should be excluded from the audit universe including non-underwritten records, and records that were not within the dates of service range for the respective Option Period. Documentation justifying a records exclusion from the audit sample or audit universe must be received by the Government not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the universe listing. Records identified as non-underwritten or outside of the option period date range, will be removed from the audit sample and the audit universe by the Government and will not be replaced."
Subsection H.11.b.(3)(c)[3] first sentence is deleted in its entirety and replaced as follows:
"The contractor will be able to use this process for four full calendar quarters following the sample claim pull for Option Periods II through VIII."
As a result of this modification contract replacement Section H is provided. Remove the current Section H, and insert the attached replacement Section H pages H-1 through H-26.

The contractor shall ensure that the standards for access, in terms of beneficiary travel time, appointment wait time, and office wait time for various categories of services contained in 32 CFR 199.17(p)(5) are met for beneficiaries residing in a TRICARE Prime service area. These standards shall be met in a manner which achieves beneficiary satisfaction with access to network providers and services as set forth in the contract.
C-7.1.8. The contractor shall maintain an accurate, up-to-date list of network providers including their specialty, gender, work address, work fax number, and work telephone number for each service area, whether or not they are accepting new beneficiaries, and the provider's status as a member of the Reserve Component or National Guard. The contractor shall provide easy access to this list, to include making it available upon request, for all beneficiaries, providers, and Government representatives. The contractor shall, at a minimum, maintain this list in a mutally agreeable format for which the contractor agrees not to claim any proprietary interest For the purposes of this requirement, "up-to-date" means an electronic, paper, telephone or combination of these approaches that accurately reflects the name, specialty, gender, work address, and work telephone number of each network provider and whether or not the provider is accepting new patients. The information contained on all electronic lists shall be current within the last 30 calendar days.
C-7.1.9. The network, or networks, shall complement services provided by MTFs in the region. They shall be sufficient in number, mix, and geographic distribution of fully qualified providers to provide the full scope of benefits for which all Prime enrollees are eligible under this contract, as described in 32 CFR 199.4, 199.5, and 199.17. The contractor's provider networks shall also support the requirements of special programs described in the TRICARE Operations Manual and TRICARE Policy Manual.
C-7.1.10. (a) As a condition of participation in the contractor's network, providers shall submit all claims electronically. The contractor shall ensure that ****% of all claims submitted by network providers are submitted electronically for Option Period II. The required percentage of network claims which must be submitted electronically for the following years is as follows:
 
When electronic claims fall below the required percentage for any Option Period, the Government shall recover the overpayments on an annual basis. Overpayment will be calculated based on the difference between paper claim rate and electronic claim rate specified in Section B of the contract for the number of claims falling below the required percentage. The Contracting Officer will issue a demand letter for the recovery of overpayment.
(b) Contractor shall maintain the provider network size of **** physicians and behavioral health professionals as measured on a monthly basis by the HMHS report ZUPRV400R entitled "South Region Network Adequacy Report by Prime Service Area Grand Summary Report" in the categories of primary care, medical specialists, surgical specialists, and behavioral health specialists.

[1] Claims rate processing payments are based on TEDs being accepted provisionally or clearing all edits, whichever comes first. These are identified in the TEDs manual. Payments will be based on a claim rate times the number of claims clearing edits. Payments for claims the contractor receives within 120 calendar days following the cessation of health care delivery (for services rendered during the health care delivery period) are made based on the claim rate in effect during the health care delivery period immediately preceding transition-out. Since all claims must be processed within 180 calendar days, the Government will not pay the outgoing contractor the health care or administrative cost associated with claims not processed to completion within 180 calendar days from the cessation of health care delivery.
[2] Payment terms. Claims processing payments are paid 30 days from the date of the cycle that included the accepted or cleared TEDs. If cycle processing is delayed by TMA, this period will be shortened to account for TMA downtime.
[3] No separate invoices are required for claims processing payments based on the automated processes tied to claims clearing TEDs edits. However, invoices are required for non-automated payment requests, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer. If TEDs is not operating normally, see TOM Chapter 3 Section 9 paragraph 1.2.
[4] Claims processing payments procedures are the same for both underwritten and non-underwritten benefit claims.
(b) TRICARE Service Centers (TSCs). Invoice on a monthly basis for an entire month. Payment will be made 30 days after the end of the month invoiced or 15 days after the invoice has been received by TMA CRM and certified by an authorized Government official, whichever is later.

G-5. MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM (MHS) ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES
The Government will unilaterally determine the number of MHS eligible beneficiaries two times each option period I through VI under the Per Member per Month contract line item numbers, once for the first six month period and once for the seventh through twelfth month. The Government will also make the same unilateral determination once for each option period VII and VIII. This will be done using an average of six of the seven previous months of eligible beneficiaries as reported by the MHS Data Repository in their monthly "Point-In-Time Extract" as adjusted by TMA (see Attachment 4). Using the number of MHS eligible beneficiaries, the Government will issue a delivery order for a six month period.
G-6. MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM (MHS) TRICARE RESERVE SELECT ENROLLED BENEFICIARIES

The Government will also make the same unilateral determination once for each option period VII and VIII. This will be done using an average of six of the seven previous months of eligible beneficiaries as reported by the MHS Data Repository in their monthly "Point-In-Time Extract" as adjusted by TMA (see Attachment 4). Using the number of TRICARE Reserve Select enrolled beneficiaries, the Government will issue a delivery order for a six month period.
 
 
H.1. Contractor Financial Underwriting of Healthcare Costs
a. General Discussion
(1) The Managed Care Support (MCS) contractor will underwrite the cost of civilian health care services (also referred to as "purchased care" which is defined as care rendered outside the Direct Care System) provided to all CHAMPUS-eligible beneficiaries* residing in the contract area except:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) The underwriting mechanism will consist of an underwriting fee which may be considered to be an underwriting premium associated with the risk assumed by the contractor. It will be subject to a fee-adjustment formula or "fee curve," which allows for increases or decreases inversely related to the actual costs. There is potential for the contractor to earn a negative fee if the actual healthcare costs for a given contract year were significantly higher than a specified target cost for that year. The adjustment mechanism is described in the subsequent paragraphs.
b. Administration of Financial Underwriting by Contractor
(1) This paragraph defines and explains the mechanics and the administration process of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
Each of these parameters is explained below.
(2) Target health care cost. The target health care cost for each period of health care delivery will be set as follows:
(a) The target cost for health care delivery in option period I under the contract is set forth in Section B (informational line item 011001). This target cost includes the purchased-care costs for non-TRICARE/Medicare dual-eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries residing in the area, whether they are enrolled with an MTF PCM, a network PCM, or are non-enrolled. The target cost will not change except for definitized healthcare changes or other equitable adjustment.
(b) For option period II and subsequent periods, the Government and the contractor will negotiate the target cost before the start of each option period for the sub-line item numbers for underwritten healthcare and incorporate them in Section B of the contract. The target cost will be depicted at the informational sub-line items in each option period. The negotiation process shall begin with the submission of a proposal by the contractor not later than the first day of the seventh month of option periods I through VI with VII and VIII combined into one negotiation period. Once the target cost for the next year is established, the only adjustments that would be made for that year would be for negotiated healthcare changes, definitized healthcare change orders, other equitable adjustment healthcare change orders issued
 
 
after the completion of the negotiations that affect the year just negotiated. If an agreement cannot be reached on the target cost by 30 days before the start of the next option period, the option will be exercised using the prior option period's target cost as specified in Section B as the estimated target cost in Section B. A target-setting formula will be used to determine the target cost. This formula will set the target for the option period retroactively 12 to 18 months after that option period is completed. The contractor will continue to receive payments for underwritten health care costs as addressed in Section G, "Payments", and a portion of fee as addressed in Section H-2, "Partial Payment of Underwriting Fee during Performance".
(c) The retroactive target cost is calculated as follows:
 actual underwritten CHAMPUS health care costs in the area in the previous option period is multiplied by the national trend factor for underwritten CHAMPUS healthcare costs from the beginning of the previous year up to the end of that year.
(3) Target Underwriting Fee
The term, "target underwriting fee" is equivalent to target fee. The target underwriting fee for all option periods is established at contract award using the contractor's proposed dollar amount for the initial contract award as set forth in Section B. When the parties negotiate the target cost for option period II and/or subsequent periods, the parties will apply the fee percentage proposed at contract award (for the relevant time period) to the negotiated target cost to determine the actual target fee. In the event the parties are unable to negotiate the target cost for option period II and/or subsequent periods, the target underwriting fee will be the dollar amount established at contract award. For option period VI through VIII, the fall-back process is retained, but the dollar amount for use in the "fall-back" formula established at contract award is deterined as follows:
"For option VI, the fixed target fee to be used in the fall-back formula would be set at the level of the option V negotiated target fee (as modified by any subsequent change-orders not already considered in the negotiated amount) accelerated to option VI at the same annual rate as proposed by HMHS for the acceleration of its fixed-fee amounts from option II through option V (8.0%). For option VII, which is a six-month option period, the fixed fee amount would be set at half of the option VI fixed fee, accelerated at the same annual rate for a period of 9 months (from the mid-point of option VI, to the mid-point of option VII) ,resulting in a multiplicative factor of .5297 from option VI to option VII. For option VIII,which is also a six-month option period, the option VII fixed fee would be accelerated at the same annual rate for an additional six months (from the mid-point of option VII to the mid-point of option VIII), resulting in a multiplicative factor of 1.0392 from option VII to VIII. The multiplicative factors will be rounded to four decimal places. Based on this procedure and the current negotiated target fee for option V ($**** the following fixed-fee amounts would apply for option VI - $**** option VII - $**** and option VIII - $****
The target underwriting fee is then only adjusted by negotiated healthcare changes, definitized healthcare change orders, or other equitable adjustments. The parties agree to utilize the same fee percentage proposed for the initial award in these negotiated adjustments.
(4) Minimum and Maximum Fee
The minimum and maximum are as follows:
(a) The minimum fee that may be realized by the contractor will be negative 4 percent of the target cost for each contract year.
(b) The maximum fee that may be realized by the contractor will be 10 percent of the target cost for each contract year.
(5) Fee Determination The underwriting fee will be determined using the fee adjustment formula as follows:
(a) When underwritten actual costs are less than the target cost, the fee will be the lesser of two amounts: (1) the target fee plus 20% of the difference between the target cost and the actual cost, or (2) the maximum fee amount.
(b) When underwritten actual costs exceed the target, the fee will be the greater of two amounts: (1) the target fee plus 20% of the difference between the target cost and the actual cost (a negative number), or (2) the minimum fee amount (a negative number).
 
(c) Mathematically, this formula may be expressed as:
      Target Fee + .20(Target Cost  Actual Cost)
The final determination of fee will occur approximately 12 to 18 months after the end of the option period to which it applies. This final determination will be based on underwritten TEDs accepted by TMA through the ninth month (Option Periods I and II) and through the sixth month (Option Periods III through VIII), after the end of the option period. However, prior to the fee determination, the Government will determine an interim fee approximately three months after the end of the option period to which it applies based on the available TED data and the Government's estimate to completion. Partial and final payment of the fee will be conducted in accordance with H-2 and H-3.
(6) Actual Underwritten Healthcare Costs.
Actual underwritten costs for fee determination purposes will be measured from TRICARE Encounter Data (TEDs) accepted by the Government, less unallowable costs determined by audits, and estimated to completion (by the Government). The actual costs will include resource-sharing costs and any other valid, underwritten health-care costs not reported on TEDs, but previously agreed upon by the Government. Healthcare cost details and clarifications include:
(a) Underwritten costs. The target and actual costs will both include all non-TRICARE/Medicare dual-eligible CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries enrolled with MTF PCMs in addition to all network-enrolled and non-enrolled non-TRICARE/Medicare dual-eligible beneficiaries.
(b) Local Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) will have control over all beneficiaries who enroll in TRICARE Prime with an MTF Primary Care Manager (PCM). These enrollees will include Active Duty Service Members (ADSMs) as well as CHAMPUSeligible beneficiaries. Only those dollars expended for
Non-TRICARE/Medicare dual-eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries will be accumulated as actual healthcare costs to be compared with the target cost for the period.
(c) Enrollment Fees. Enrollment fees collected by the contractor are considered part of the administrative price and are not considered in the determination of the target cost or the actual cost of healthcare under the contract.
(d) Medical Management Costs. The costs of medical-management activities, such as case management, disease management, and utilization management are not considered as healthcare costs.
(e) Capitated Arrangements. Capitation arrangements are prohibited.
H.2. Partial Payment of Underwriting Fee during Performance
In addition to the requirements and procedures specified in this section regarding interim and final health care underwriting fee determination, the Government will make partial payments against the target fee as specified below.
a. During performance of each option period, the Government will pay the contractor, on a monthly pro-rated basis, an amount equal to 50% of the target fee.
b. Interim and final determination of fee for the base period and each subsequent option period will be in accordance with paragraphs H.1. And H.3.
H.3. Interim Fee Determination
a. If the interim fee calculation described in H.1. indicates that a positive fee will be earned upon final determination, the Government will pay the contractor an amount equal to 90% of the interim fee for that period. This will be paid in a lump sum to the contractor; less any partial fee payments made for that period. The final balance for fee will be paid 12-18 months after the contract period in accordance with the final fee determination scheme.
b. If the interim fee calculation indicates that a negative fee will be earned upon final determination, no interim fee payments will be made. Final fee determination will be made in accordance with paragraph H.1.
H.4. Resource Sharing
a. Resource sharing is an alternative means of satisfying the purchased-care needs of non-TRICARE/Medicare dual-eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries and is a tool that may be used by the Parties to reduce purchased-care and overall underwritten expenditures. All resource sharing agreements (See the TRICARE Operations Manual, Chapter 16) shall be cost effective to the Government and the contractor.
 
 
b. Any allowable resource-sharing expenditure will be reimbursed and will count as actual underwritten healthcare.
c. Although resource sharing is intended primarily to provide care to underwritten CHAMPUS-eligible beneficiaries, when a resource sharing asset provides care to non-underwritten beneficiaries, the costs of providing such care is counted as actual underwritten costs for fee determination, just like resource sharing expenditures for underwritten beneficiaries.
d. There will be no need to account for the number of Military Treatment Facility outpatient visits or admissions enabled by resource sharing for purposes of determining contract payments, which is separate from the progress reports required under TRICARE Operations Manual, Chapter 15, Section 3. See TRICARE Systems Manual, Chapter 2, Section 1.1, Paragraph 8 for process for reporting Fee-for Service to TMA.
H.5. Allowable Health Care Cost and Payment
a. The purpose of this clause is to define reimbursable healthcare costs and to clarify how healthcare costs apply to FAR clause 52.216-7, "Allowable Cost and Payment". This clause does not apply to reimbursable costs associated with the disease management administrative services contract line item number. This clause does not substitute any portion of, and does not make changes to FAR 52.216-7.
"Healthcare costs", as used in this clause, are direct healthcare costs that are underwritten by the contractor.
"Allowable cost", as used in this clause and FAR 52.216-7 are healthcare costs that include both provisionally and fully accepted TEDs records. These costs are reimbursed with obligated funds dispersed under this contract. A submission by the contractor to the TEDs system alone does not make it an allowable cost.
Non-underwritten "costs" are costs to the Government, and are not costs to the contractor. Non-underwritten "payments" are draws of funds directly from the Federal Reserve by the contractor or disbursed by TMA to the contractor. These draws are not considered payments to the contractor, and not considered a reimbursement of allowable health care costs from funds obligated on the contract.
b. A submission to TEDs as described in the TRICARE Operations Manual is considered an acceptable invoice or voucher required in accordance with FAR 52.216-7(a)(1).
c. Due to the nature of health care costs, the portions of FAR 52.216-7 that relate to materials, direct labor, direct travel, other direct costs, indirect costs, incidental expenses, and pension plan contributions are not applicable. As such, any portions of FAR 52.216-7 that relate to indirect cost rates and billing rates are not applicable.
d. In reference to FAR 52.216-7 (g), "audits", as used in this clause includes audits on statistically valid samples. The audit results will be applied to the entire universe from which the audit sample was drawn to determine total unallowable costs. Overpayments made by the contractor, whether found in an audited sample or audit results applied to the entire universe from which the sample was drawn, are unallowable costs. The Contracting Officer will notify the contractor of intent to disallow costs in accordance with FAR 52.242-1, Notice of Intent to Disallow Costs. Underpayments made by the contractor that are found in an audit are not used to offset overpayment adjustments.
e. In reference to FAR 52.216-7 (h)(2), the Contracting Officer will not approve contractor's expense to secure refunds, rebates, credits, or other amounts (including incentives), as allowable costs for reimbursement under the cost-reimbursable line items, including health care line items.
H.6. Evolving Practices, Devices, Medicines, Treatments and Procedures
a. Medical practices and procedures are expected to continue developing during the period of this contract. Some will increase and some will decrease the cost of medical care. These changes will include practices, devices, medicines, treatments and procedures that previously were excluded from the benefits as unproven. There shall be no change in the Target Cost or Target Fee as a result of changes in the approval status of drugs, devices, medical treatments and medical procedures. The contractor underwrites all costs of all drugs covered under this contract, devices, medical treatments or medical procedures that move from unproven to proven. Changes caused by changes in the statutory definitions of the benefit or new benefits added by statute will be implemented under the Changes clause.
 
 
b. TRICARE can only cover costs for medically necessary supplies and services. Regulatory procedures are in place at
32 C.F.R. 199.4(g)(15) that describe the procedure for evaluating the safety and efficacy of unproven drugs, devices, medical treatments, or medical procedures. The contractor shall be responsible for routinely reviewing the hierarchy of reliable evidence, as defined in 32 C.F.R. 199.2, and shall bring to the Government's attention drugs, devices, medical treatments, or medical procedures that they believe have moved from unproven to proven in a written report to the Government in accordance with F-5.
H.7. Integrated Process Teams
The Government may develop major contract and program changes through Integrated Process Teams (IPTs). This provision describes the contractor's participation in this process. The contractor will provide the appropriate personnel (as agreed to by the Contracting Officer and the contractor) to serve on IPTs to develop and/or improve the technical, business, and implementation approach to any and all proposed TRICARE program contract changes within 14 calendar days after notification by the Contracting Officer. The contractor will participate in the entire process with the Government team from concept development through incorporating the change into the contract. This process includes developing budgetary cost estimates, requirement determination, developing rough order of magnitude cost estimates, preparing specifications/statements of work, and establishing a mutually agreeable equitable adjustment to the contract price as a result of incorporating the change (including pricing, negotiations, etc). IPTs will not be formed for all contract changes, but generally will be formed for complex, system-wide issues. The contractor shall participate in all required meetings as determined by the Government team leader, regardless of how they are held (in person, via teleconference, by video-teleconference, or through electronic conferences within the TMA web site). The frequency and scheduling will vary depending on the topic.
H.8. Performance Guarantee
a. The performance guarantee described in this provision is the contractor's guarantee that the contractor's performance will not be less than the performance standards described below. The rights of the Government and remedies described in the Performance Guarantee provision are in accordance with, and in addition to all other rights and remedies of the Government. Specifically, the Government reserves its rights and remedies set forth in the Inspection of Services clause (FAR 52.246-4, 52.246-5) and the Default clause (FAR 52.249-8, 52.249-6).
b. The contractor guarantees that performance will meet or exceed the standards in this provision. For each occurrence the contractor fails to meet each guaranteed standard, the Government will withhold from the contractor the amount listed in the schedule below. Performance guarantee withholds will continue until the guarantee amount for the respective option period is depleted or the contractor's performance improves to meet or exceed the standard. Performance will be measured as specified below. The contractor will be notified and withholds made on a quarterly basis. For the purposes of this provision, the term "performance standard" is defined as the contract standards that are restated in this provision.
c. Performance Guarantee Amounts:
 
 
d. Telephone Service (Busy Signals)
Standard: Not less than 95% of all calls shall be received without the caller encountering a busy signal
A performance guarantee shall be applied as follows:
Based on the contractor's monthly report, the Government will withhold a performance guarantee amount of $0.50 per blocked call in excess of the standard (not less than 95% of all calls shall be received without the caller encountering a busy signal). For example, if 92% of calls are received but 8% are blocked by a busy signal, then a performance guarantee equal to 3% of the calls [3% represents the difference between the actual number of blocked calls and the standard] will be assessed. If 3% equates to 100 calls, the performance guarantee withhold will be $50.00 or 100 times $0.50. The blockage rate shall be determined no less frequently than once per hour.
"All calls" is defined as any call to any contractor operated TRICARE customer service telephone number. Customer service shall be interpreted in the broadest terms including, but not limited to, telephone calls from beneficiaries, providers, Government representatives, and interested parties about general program information, network providers, enrollment, eligibility, benefits, referrals, preauthorization's/authorizations, claims, complaints, processes and procedures.
e. Telephone Service (Total Hold Time)
Standard: 95% of all calls shall not be on hold for a period of more than 30 seconds during the entire telephone call
A performance guarantee shall be applied as follows:
If performance falls below the standard for each individual call that has a total hold time of more than 30 seconds based on the contractor's monthly report (calls exceeding the 30 second total hold time divided by total calls received during the month), the Government will withhold a performance guarantee amount of $0.50. For example, if only 92% of calls that have a total hold time of 30 seconds are less, the actual number of calls failing the 95% standard will be assessed a performance guarantee. In this example, the difference equals 3%. If 3% of calls equates to 100 calls not meeting the 30 second total hold time standard, the performance guarantee withhold will be $50.00 or, 100 times $0.50.
f. Claims Processing Timeliness (Retained Claims and Adjustment Claims)
Standard: Not less than 95% of retained claims and adjustment claims processed shall be completed within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt
A performance guarantee shall be applied as follows:
If the contractor fails to meet the standard, the Government will withhold a performance guarantee amount of $1.00 per retained claim in excess of the 95% standard. For example, if only 91% of retained claims are processed within 30 calendar days, a performance guarantee will be assessed equal to 4% of the claims processed that month. The 4% represents the difference between the actual performance of 91% and the standard of 95%. If 4% equates to 600 claims, the performance guarantee withhold will be $600.00 or 600 times $1.00. The number of claims failing to meet the standard will be determined monthly based on the TMA TED database.
g. Claims Processing Timeliness (Retained Claims)
Standard: 100% of retained claims shall be processed to completion within 60 calendar days
A performance guarantee shall be applied as follows:
If the contractor fails to meet the standard of 100% of retained claims processed to completion within 60 days, the Government will withhold a performance guarantee amount of $1.00 per retained claim not meeting the standard. For example, if actual performance is 99% of retained claims processed to completion within 60 days, the contractor will be assessed a performance guarantee equal to 1% (the difference between the contractor's actual performance and the standard. If 1% equates to 100 claims, the withhold will be $100.00, or 100 times $1.00. The number of claims failing to meet the standard will be determined monthly based on the TMA TED database.
h. Claims Processing Timeliness (Excluded Claims)
 
Standard: 100% of all claims shall be processed to completion within 120 calendar days.
A performance guarantee shall be applied as follows:
If the contractor fails to meet the standard and falls below the standard of all claims processed to completion within 120 calendar days, the Government will withhold a performance guarantee amount of $1.00 per claim not meeting the standard. For example, if 1% (the difference between the contractor's actual performance and the standard) of all claims are not processed to completion within 120 calendar days from the date of receipt, and that equates to 1,000 claims, the performance guarantee amount will be $1,000.00 or, 1,000 times $1.00. The number of claims failing to meet the standard will be determined monthly based on the TMA TED database. The Government will assess a performance guarantee amount monthly until the claim is processed to completion.
i. Payment Errors
Standard: The absolute value of the payment errors for sampled TEDs (initial submissions, re-submissions, and adjustments/cancellation submissions) shall not exceed 2%.
A performance guarantee shall be applied as follows:
If payment errors exceed the standard, the Government will withhold 10% of the value of payment errors exceeding the 2% standard. The Government will not net errors as a result of overpayments and underpayments. Rather, the Government will withhold a performance guarantee amount equal to 10% of the sum of all payment errors in excess of the standard. This amount will be based on the actual claims audited in the quarterly TMA audits as specified in Section H.
 
j. TED Edit Accuracy  Validity Edits
Standard: The accuracy rate for TED validity edits shall be not less than:
95 % after six months of performance during the first option period
and
99% after nine months and thereafter during the entire term of the contract
A performance guarantee shall be applied as follows:
If the contractor fails to meet the standard and falls below either of the two standards of 95 % after six months or 99 % after nine months, a performance guarantee amount of $1.00 for each TED record not meeting the standard will be withheld.
For example, if only 90% of all TEDs pass validity edits after six months, then a performance guarantee amount equal to 5% of all TEDs failing the edits during the quarter will be withheld (5% equals the difference between the contractor's actual performance and the standard in this example). If 5% equates to 1,000 TEDs, the performance guarantee amount will be $1,000.00 or 1,000 times $1.00. The number of TEDs failing to meet the standard will be determined monthly based on the TMA TED database.
k. TED Edit Accuracy  Provisional Edits
Standard: The accuracy rate for provisional edits shall not be less than:
90 % after six months of performance during the first option period
and
95 % after nine months and thereafter during the entire term of the contract
A performance guarantee shall be applied as follows:
If the contractor fails to meet the standard and falls below either of the two standards of 90 % after six months or 95 % after nine months, a performance guarantee amount of $1.00 for each TED not meeting the provisional edit standard will be withheld. For example, if only 85% of all TEDs pass provisional edits after six months, a performance guarantee equal to 5%, or the difference between the contractor's actual performance and the standard, will be assessed. If, as in this example, 5% equates to 1,000 TEDs, the performance guarantee will be $1,000.00 or 1,000 times $1.00. The number of TEDs failing to meet the standard will be determined monthly based on the TMA TED database.
l. Contractor Network Adequacy
Standard: Not less than 96% of contractor referrals of beneficiaries residing within a Prime service area shall be to a MTF or network provider with an appointment available within the access standards.
Based on the contractor's monthly report, a performance guarantee shall be applied as follows for referrals failing the standard:
 
 
For purposes of this provision, a referral is the offer of an appropriate appointment within the access standards. If the beneficiary elects not to accept the offered appointment, the contractor has met the standard. In determining the performance guarantee, the applicable amount will be determined based on the offeror's actual performance. For instance, if the contractor's actual performance is 90%, the performance guarantee will equal $75 per referral in excess of 96%. In this example if 5% equals 1,000 referrals failing the standard, the performance guarantee will equal $75,000. It is critical that the contractor recognize that the highest per referral withhold will be applied to all referrals failing the standard. The Government will not stratify the performance guarantee based on the above.
 
m. Specialty Care Referral Consultation Reports
Standard: The contractor shall ensure that network specialty providers submit clearly legible specialty care referral consultation reports, for all contractor approved "eval only" and "eval and treat" MTF referrals which require a consult report.
When the contractor receives a referral request from the MTF, the request will be processed one of the following ways:
 
 
 
 
 
All approved referral requests are entered into Medical Services Review (MSR) and await the receipt of a claim and consult report. The referrals will be designated "eval only" or "eval and treat". "Eval and treat" is the default, if not specified based upon the request from the MTF provider, as outlined in the CORE MOU. The contractor will record the type of referral upon receipt of the orders from the MTF provider. This designation will remain for the life of the referral. The contractor will designate in MSR which referral requires a consult report in accordance with Section C-7.2.2, as further detailed by the rule set agreed to by the contractor and TRO-S.
The contractor will display on the Web the status of each request sent to the contractor by the MTF provider. This includes all MTF referrals, whether the referral was approved, denied or cancelled. Approved MTF referrals which require a consult report will be tracked and the contractor will provide the MTF the ability to request an "expedited chase" for clinically significant consult reports not delivered within timeliness standards (see Section C-7.2.c.). The display will be arranged by the month the referral was processed and identify the following:
 
 
 
Performance Guarantee (PG) Calculation/Measurement
Performance Guarantee calculation of specialty care referral consultation reports performance will be done quarterly based on the contractor's sum of three month's worth of monthly calculations. On the 15th of each month the monthly reporting will be delivered. For Option Period III the first monthly performance guarantee report will be delivered on October 15, 2006, covering April 2006 referrals. In December 2006 the first quarterly guarantee report for Option Period III will be delivered covering April, May and June of 2006. For subsequent Option Periods, the monthly performance guarantee report will be delivered on the 15th of the month and the quarterly assessment on the contractor's sum of three month's worth of monthly calculations.
10 working day standard:
": Consult returns shall be provided to the MTF within 10 working days of the specialty encounter 98% of the time. Computation of this performance guarantee will be accomplished by using the last date of service of the referred care as the trigger date. A performance guarantee will be withheld for each report not provided within the standard in the amount of:
Eval only"
$25.00 per missing report in Option Period III
$50.00 per missing report in Option Period IV
$75.00 per missing report in Option Period V, and any exercised extension after Option Period V
For example, if 96% of reports are provided to the initiating MTF within 10 working days of last date of service for the rendered care by network specialty physician providers during Option Period III, and 100 reports are required, the Government will withhold $50 ($25 x 2 missing/late reports not meeting the 98% standard). If neither evidence of an appointment kept nor a claim has been submitted nor a consult report has been received within the 5 month period, no performance guarantee is assessed, and the referral is presumed to represent a beneficiary who did not fulfill an appointment as a result of the referral.
 
30 calendar day standard:
(a). : Consult returns shall be provided to the MTF within 30 calendar days of the specialty encounter 100% of the time. Computation of this performance guarantee will be accomplished by using the last date of service of the referred care as the trigger date, and applying one of the following assessment criteria:
"Eval only"
i. When the consult return percentage is less than 98%, the performance guarantee penalty will be computed by multiplying the total expected by 2% and then multiplying by the performance guarantee amount.
ii. When the consult return percentage is greater than 98%, the performance guarantee penalty will be computed by subtracting that actual achieved percentage from the 100% standard, then multiplying the difference by the total expected consults. The results should then be multiplied by the performance guarantee amount.
A performance guarantee will be withheld for each report not provided within the standard in the amount of:
$25.00 per missing report in Option Period III
$50.00 per missing report in Option Period IV
$75.00 per missing report in Option Period V, and any exercised extension after Option Period V
(b.) : Consult returns shall be provided to the MTF within 30 calendar days of the specialty encounter 100% of the time. Computation of this performance guarantee will be accomplished by using the initial date of service of the referred care as the trigger date. A performance guarantee will be withheld for each report not provided within the standard in the amount of:
"Eval and treat"
$25.00 per missing report in Option Period III
$50.00 per missing report in Option Period IV
$75.00 per missing report in Option Period V, and any exercised extension after Option Period V
For example, if 95 reports are provided within 30 calendar days of the initial "eval and treat" visit by network specialty physician providers during Option Period III, and 100 reports are required, the Government will withhold $125 ($25 x 5 missing/late reports not received within 30 calendar days). If neither evidence of an appointment kept nor a claim has been submitted nor a consult report has been received within the 5 month period, no performance guarantee is assessed, and the referral is presumed to represent a beneficiary who did not fulfill an appointment as a result of the referral.
H.9. Award Fee
The award fee will be administered quarterly following the completion of each contract quarter in accordance with the award fee plan. The award fee pool is prorated into two quarters in option period I, VII and VIII and into four equal amounts for the remaining option years II through VI as shown in Section B. Awarded portions are disbursed quarterly in accordance with the award fee plan. Unawarded portions of the award fee pool are not available for any subsequent period. The results of the Government administered surveys will be considered in determining the award fee and that any contractor administered survey results are specifically excluded from consideration.
H.10. Processing of Newborn Claims
For those newborns who are covered under the 60 day "deemed enrollment" benefit, the contractor shall code these claims as civilian PCM Prime until a formal enrollment action or the end of the 60 day period, whichever is earlier. If the newborn is formally enrolled during this 60 day period, for claims incurred after the formal enrollment the contractor shall code the claims according to the formal PCM assignment. If the newborn is not formally enrolled after the 60 calendar day period, for claims subsequently incurred after the 60 days the contractor shall process these claims as a non-enrolled beneficiary, applying the appropriate TRICARE cost shares and deductibles. Note that this PCM coding approach during the "deemed enrollment" period does not affect the status of these newborns for purposes of the contract's underwriting provisions, as underwriting applies to eligible newborns regardless of their enrollment or CM status. Similarly, this PCM coding approach during the "deemed enrollment" period does not change TRICARE policy regarding the actual payment of the claim from a beneficiary or provider perspective.
H.11. Claim Cycle time and Audit Methodology
a. Claim Cycle Time Measurement.
 
The Government will calculate the claim cycle time based on data submitted on TRICARE Encounter Data (TEDs). The cycle time is calculated as one plus the difference between the Julian date that the claim or adjustment claim was processed to completion and the Julian date of receipt or the Julian date the claim was identified as an adjustment. Only a single cycle time will be calculated per claim. This cycle time will be calculated using all unedited TEDs initial submission vouchers (Voucher Resubmission Number equals zero) which are received by TMA during each quarter and which pass the voucher header edits. TEDs in vouchers which fail the voucher header edits or which are otherwise unprocessable as submitted by the Contractor and TEDs in resubmission vouchers (Voucher Resubmission Number is greater than zero) will be excluded from the claim cycle time calculation.
(1) Quarterly Healthcare Audit - Claim Audit Sampling and Error Determinations
(a) Sampling Methodology
Sample means will be used as point estimates of payment and occurrence errors. There will be two kinds of payment samples, one for non-denied claims and one for denied claims. The design of non-denied payment and the occurrence samples utilizes a ninety percent (90%) confidence level, while the denied payment sample design uses an eighty percent (80%) confidence level. Precision estimates are 1.0 percent (1%) for the non-denied payment sample, 2.0 percent (2%) for the denied payment sample, and 1.5 percent (1.5%) for the occurrence sample. The non-denied payment sample will be drawn from all records with government payments of $100 to $100,000. In addition, all records with a government payment of $100,000 and over will be audited. The denied payment sample will be drawn from all records with billed amounts of $100 to $100,000. In addition, all records with billed amounts of $100,000 and over will be audited. The non-denied and denied payment samples will be stratified at multiple levels within the $100 to $100,000 range. Samples will be drawn on a quarterly basis from TED records which are fully or provisionally accepted. Records to be sampled will be "net" records (i.e. the sum of transaction records available at the time the sample was drawn related to the initial transaction record). TED records in voucher batches which fail any validity edits or which are otherwise unprocessable as submitted by the contractor will be excluded from the sampling frame.
(b) Required Contractor Documentation.
[1] Upon receipt of the TEDs Internal Control Number (ICN) listing from TMA or designated audit contractor, the Contractor shall retrieve and compile processing documentation for each selected claim. The Contractor shall submit one legible copy of each claim and the following required documents via registered mail, certified mail or similarly guaranteed delivery service. All documentation must be received at TMA or designated audit contractors within 30 calendar days from the date of the TMA or designated audit contractors letter transmitting the ICN listing:
(i) Claim-related correspondence when attached to claim or related to the adjudication action, such as status inquiries, written and/or telephone, development records, other telephone conversation records.
(ii) Other claim-related documentation, such as medical reports and medical review records, coding sheets, all authorization and referral forms and their supporting documentation, referrals for civilian medical care (SF Forms 513 or 2161), other health insurance and third party liability documents, discounted rate agreements to include the following information: 1) provider name, 2) provider identification number, 3) effective and termination dates of agreements; and 4) negotiated rate or fee schedule and such other documents as are required to support the action taken on the claim.
(iii) A copy of the EOB (or EOB facsimile) for each claim selected.
(iv) The contractor shall send via electronic data input on a 3480 cartridge the current family history (15 to 27 months) for each selected claim. This electronic data containing all required data fields must be received by TMA or designated audit contractor within 30 calendar days from the date of the TMA or designated audit contractor letter transmitting the ICN listing.
[2] Payment errors or occurrence errors will be assessed if the Contractor does not provide the above claim-related documents or if the documents provided are not legible. The Contractor has the option of submitting the original document in those cases where the copy is not legible. TMA or designated audit contractors will return original documents upon completion of the audit process.
(c) Additional Data to be Furnished by the Contractor.
[1] Description of data elements by field position in family history file printout. Initial submission to TMA is due by the commencement of claims processing and revisions as they occur.
 
[2] Claim adjudication guidelines used by processors; automated prepayment utilization review screens; automated duplicate screening criteria and manual resolution instructions shall be submitted to TMA by the commencement of claims processing.
[3] Unique internal procedure codes with narrative and cross-reference to approved TRICARE codes and pricing manuals used in claims processing. Initial submission to TRICARE is due by the commencement of claims processing and revisions as they occur, but not later than the 5th work day of the month following the change.
[4] Specifications for submission of the provider and pricing files are described in the TEDs System Manual. Initial submission to TMA is due by the commencement of claims processing and updates to the files are to be submitted as specified in the TEDs System Manual.
(d) Payment Error and Process Error Determinations.
[1] There are two categories of payment errors: (1) a payment error which cannot be removed by contractor post payment processing actions and (2) a payment error which can removed by contractor post payment processing actions (see list of audit error codes defining payment error categories). Payment errors which can be removed by contractor post payment actions will also be assessed a process error at audit. If contractor post payment actions substantiate the initial processing decision, the payment error will be removed but the process error will remain. If the initial processing action is not substantiated, both the payment and the process error will remain. Claims containing process errors will not affect payment or occurrence error rates, but will be used as a performance indicator.
[2] Payment errors are the amount of over/under payments on a claim, including but not limited to a payment in the correct amount but sent to the wrong payee, denial of a payable claim, misapplication of the deductible, payment of a noncovered service/supplies, or services/supplies for which a benefit determination cannot be based on the information available at the time of processing. Process errors result from: noncompliance with a required procedure or process, such as development required but not performed, medical emergency not substantiated, medical necessity review not evident and are cited in conjunction with a payment error. Process error determinations are based on the claim information available and those processing actions which have passed the TMA TED Validity edits up to the time the audit sample is pulled.
[3] Payment errors which may not be removed by Contractor post payment actions (see audit error categories) are based only on the claim information available and those processing actions which have passed the TMA TED Validity edits up to the time the audit sample is pulled. Actions and determinations occurring subsequent to the date the audit sample is pulled or actions and determinations which have not passed the TMA TED Validity edits are not a consideration of the audit regardless of whether resolution of a payment error results. Because adjustment transactions are not allowed on total claim denials, subsequent reprocessing actions to the denied claim which occur prior to the date the audit sample is pulled will be considered during the audit.
[4] The measure of the payment error is the TED record. The audit process (for the payment samples) projects universe value based on the audit results. The samples (non-denied and denied) are separately projected to the universe of claims for each quarter. The results of these projections are then combined into the following categories: total number of claims in the universe, government payment estimation, correct government payment, error amount and the estimated error percent in the universe of claims.
[5] All incorrectly coded financial fields on a TED are considered to be occurrence errors regardless of whether associated errors exist.
(e) Computation of the "Total Amount Billed" for Denied Claims.
[1] For treatment encounters for which no per diem, negotiated rate or DRG-based amount applies for consideration of payment, the "total amount billed" is the actual amount billed on the claims. This applies to treatment encounters involving services from DRG-exempt hospitals and hospital units, those involving DRG-exempt services and those which would otherwise be subject to the DRG-based payment methodology but for which a DRG allowed amount cannot be computed, regardless of whether or not these claim are paid;
[2] For treatment encounters subject to the TRICARE per diem payments, negotiated rate, or the DRG-reimbursement methodology, the "total amount billed" is the correct per diem, negotiated rate, or DRG-based allowable amount including any applicable outlier amounts.
 
[3] If a claim is selected for audit and the Contractor cannot produce the claim or the claim provided is not auditable, a 100 percent payment error based upon the total amount billed will be assessed. For health care services records which do not represent a legitimate condition requiring submission of a record as defined in the TRICARE Systems Manual, a 100 percent error will be assessed. The payment error amount will be based upon the total amount billed. This condition is considered to be an unsupported TED.
(f) TED Occurrence Error Determination
[1] The TED occurrence error rate is defined as the total number of errors divided by the total number of data fields in the sample times 100.
[2] Occurrence errors determinations are based on only the claim information available and those processing actions taken at the time of adjudication. Actions and determinations occurring subsequent to the processed date of an audited claim, such as obtaining other health insurance documentation, adjusting a claim to correct financial or other data fields, or developing for required information not obtained prior to processing, are not a consideration of the audit regardless of whether a resolution of the incorrectly coded TED results.
[3] Occurrence errors result from an incorrect entry in any data field of the TED. There are no exceptions. Any error, including errors in financial fields, shall be counted as occurrence errors.
[4] Some TED error conditions are not attributable to any one specific data field but apply to the record as a whole or to certain parts of the record. In addition to erroneous data field coding, the following error conditions involving incorrect or unsupported records will result in occurrence errors being assessed as indicated.
Following are error conditions and the associated number of occurrence errors assessed with each condition; payment error codes that post payment actions do not apply; payment error codes that post-payment actions do apply, and process error codes.
 
 
The following are payment errors on which post payment actions are either not applicable or would not remove the payment errors assessed.

The following are process errors which will be assessed for noncompliance of a required procedure/process. These errors are neither occurrence errors or payment errors and are not used to calculate the occurrence error or payment error rate. A payment error will be assessed along with the process error. Upon rebuttal if the process is followed to conclusion and the actions support the original decision, the payment error will be removed but the process error will remain.

(2) Error Determination Rebuttals
(a) Contractor rebuttals of audit error findings must be submitted to TMA or the designated quality audit within 45 calendar days of the date of the audit transmittal letters. Rebuttals not postmarked within 45calendar days of the audit letter will be excluded from further consideration.
Rebuttal responses are final and will not receive further consideration except when during the audit rebuttal process the contractor submits a claim not previously submitted with the audit and an error is assessed, or when the contractor's explanation of the basis on which a claim was processed results in the assessment of a new error not previously reviewed by the contractor. Contractor rebuttals to new errors assessed by TMA or the designated audit contractor during the initial rebuttal process must be postmarked within 30 calendar days of the TRICARE or designated quality review contractor rebuttal response letter. Rebuttals to new errors not postmarked within 30 calendar days from the date of the rebuttal letter will be excluded from further consideration. The due dates of rebuttals will be calculated by adding 45 to the Julian calendar date of the TMA or designated audit contractor audit letter or by adding 30 to the Julian calendar date of the TMA or designated audit contractor rebuttal response letter.
b. Annual Healthcare Cost Audit
 
TRICARE Encounter Data (TED) batch/voucher payment records are utilized to determine allowable cost. The total allowable amount is calculated on a per record basis, using all fields used to calculate a batch/voucher header total, and for dates of service falling within a specified option period. The total government paid amount will be calculated using all edited TEDs batch/vouchers with resubmission number equal to zero and which are received by TMA. Batch/ voucher records that have not passed validity edits on the TED record or which are otherwise unprocessable as submitted by the contractor will be excluded from the sample.
(1) Claim Audit Sampling and Error Determinations.
(a) Sampling Methodology and Application of Results for Option Period I
A stratified random sample of claims from the universe of non-denied underwritten claims will be used to estimate the mean overpayment amount per claim in the claims universe and the lower limit of a one-sided ninety-percent (90%) confidence interval (estimated mean - 1.2815 x standard error). All claims in the sample determined to have been underpaid will be deemed to have an overpayment amount of zero. The lower limit of the confidence interval will be used as the recovery amount per claim in the universe of claims from which the sample is drawn. The total recovery amount will be calculated as the recovery amount per claim multiplied by the number of claims in the universe from which the sample is drawn. The payment samples will be drawn from all records with Government payments of $100 to $100,000. The payment samples will be stratified at multiple levels within the $100 to $100,000 range. In addition, all records with a government payment of $100,000 and over will be audited. Samples will be drawn from those underwritten TED records which are fully or provisionally accepted, with end dates of service in the option period, through the ninth month after the end of option period I. Claims identified as non-underwritten will be removed by the Government from the sample and the universe, and will not be replaced. The Government reserves its rights to perform specific and/or more frequent audits than annual. Records to be sampled will be "net" records (i.e. the sum transaction records available through the ninth month after the end of the option period). TEDs in batch/vouchers, that fail TRICARE validity edits or which are otherwise unprocessable as submitted by the contractor will be excluded from the sampling frame.
(b) Sampling Methodology and Application of Results for Option Periods II through VIII
For Option Periods II through VIII, the same sampling methodology used will be as described in Section H.11.b.(1) (a) above for Option Period I. For Option Period II, samples will be drawn from underwritten TED records which are fully or provisionally accepted, with end dates of service in the option period through the ninth month. For Option Periods III through VI, samples will be drawn from underwritten TED records which are fully or provisionally accepted, with end dates of service in the respective option period, through the sixth month after the end of the option period.
For Option Periods VII and VIII, a single audit will be performed. If only Option Period VII is exercised, an audit sample will be drawn from underwritten TED records with end dates of service in Option Period VII. Should the Government exercise Option period VIII, an audit sample will be drawn from underwritten TED records with end dates of service in both Option Periods VII and VIII. Sample for Option Periods VII and VIII will be drawn from underwritten TED records which are fully or provisionally accepted into the TMA database through the sixth month after the end of the last exercised Option Period.
For Option Periods III through VIII, the Government will draw the sample no later than seven (7) months after the end of the respective option period. The Government reserves its rights to perform specific and/or more frequent audits than annual. Records to be sampled will be "net" records (i.e. the sum of the option period transaction records available through the sixth month after the end of the option period). The total overpayment recovery amount for each option period will be determined based on the lower bound of a one-sided ninety-percent (90%) confidence interval. The Government shall provide, at the same time the sample is requested, a complete listing of all TED records that encompass the audit universe for each respective Option Period. The contractor must identify all TED records that it believes should be excluded from the audit universe which includes non-underwritten claims and claims that were not within the dates of service range for the respective Option Period and provide documentation justifying their exclusion not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the listing. Claims identified as non- underwritten will be removed by the Government from the sample and the universe, and will not be replaced.
(c) Required Contractor Documentation
[1] Upon receipt of the TEDs Internal Control Number (ICN) listing from TMA or designated audit contractor, the Contractor shall retrieve and compile processing documentation for each selected claim. All documentation must be
 
Received at TMA or designated audit contractors within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the TMA or designated audit contractors letter transmitting the ICN listing. The Contractor shall submit one legible copy of each claim and the following required documents via registered mail, certified mail or similarly guaranteed delivery service:
(i) Claim-related correspondence when attached to claim or related to the adjudication action, such as status inquiries, written and/or telephone, development records, other telephone conversation records.
(ii) Other claim-related documentation, such as medical reports and medical review records, coding sheets, all authorization and referral forms and their supporting documentation, referrals for civilian medical care (SF Forms 513 or 2161), other health insurance and third party liability documents, discounted rate agreements to include the following information: 1) provider name, 2) provider identification number, 3) effective and termination dates of agreements; and 4) negotiated rate or fee schedule and such other documents as are required to support the action taken on the claim
(iii) A copy of the EOB (or EOB facsimile) for each claim selected.
(iv) The current family history (15 to 27 months) for each selected claim. The Contractor shall send this via electronic data input on a 3480 cartridge.
[2] If a claim is selected for audit and the Contractor cannot produce the claim or the claim provided is not auditable, a 100 percent payment error based upon the total Government Pay Amount will be assessed.
For TEDs which do not represent a legitimate condition requiring submission of a record as defined in the TRICARE Systems Manual, a 100 percent error will be assessed. The payment error amount will be based upon the total Government Pay Amount. This condition is considered to be an unsupported TED. The contractor has the option of submitting the original document in those cases where the copy is not legible. TMA or designated audit contractors will return original documents upon completion of the audit process.
(d) Additional Data to be furnished by the Contractor
[1] Description of data elements by field position in family history file printout. Initial submission to TMA is due by the commencement of claims processing and revisions as they occur.
[2] Claim adjudication guidelines used by processors; automated prepayment utilization review screens; automated duplicate screening criteria and manual resolution instructions shall be submitted to TMA by the commencement of claims processing.
[3] Unique internal procedure codes with narrative and cross-reference to approved TRICARE codes and pricing manuals used in claims processing. Initial submission to TRICARE is due by the commencement of claims processing and revisions as they occur, but not later than the fifth (5th) work day of the month following the change.
[4] Specifications for submission of the provider and pricing files are described in the TEDs System Manual. Initial submission to TMA is due by the commencement of claims processing and updates to the files are to be submitted as specified in the TEDs System Manual.
(e) Payment Error Determination for Allowable Cost Audit
[1] The audit error codes (K codes) indicated in above will apply to the cost audit. Payment errors are based on the claim information available and those processing actions which occur prior to the date the audit sample is pulled. Consideration will be given to subsequent processing actions that occur prior to the date the audit sample is pulled, including actions that have not passed the TMA TED edits, only if supporting documentation to indicate the action taken and the date the action was completed is submitted. Actions and determinations occurring after the date the audit sample is pulled will not be considered in the audit regardless of whether resolution of payment error exists.
[2] Payment errors are the amount of over payments on a claim, including but not limited to misapplication of the deductible, payment of non-covered service/supplies, or payment of services/supplies for which a benefit cannot be determined based on the information available at the time of processing or a payment in the correct amount but sent to the wrong payee.
[3] The measure of the payment error is the TRICARE Encounter Data record. The audit process (for the payment samples) projects universe value based on the audit results.
 
(2) Cost Audit Rebuttals
(a) Contractor rebuttals of audit error findings must be submitted to TMA or the designated quality auditor within forty five calendar days of the date of the audit transmittal letters. Rebuttals not postmarked within forty five calendar days of the audit letter will be excluded from further consideration. Rebuttal responses are final and will not receive further consideration except when, during the audit rebuttal process, the contractor submits a claim not previously submitted with the audit and an error is assessed, or when the contractor's explanation of the basis on which a claim was processed results in the assessment of a new error not previously reviewed by the contractor. Contractor rebuttals to new errors assessed by TMA or the designated audit contractor during the initial rebuttal process must be postmarked within 30 calendar days of the TRICARE or designated quality review contractor rebuttal response letter. Rebuttals to new errors not postmarked within 30 calendar days from the date of the rebuttal letter will be excluded from further consideration. The due dates of rebuttals will be calculated by adding 45 to the Julian calendar date of the TMA or designated audit contractor audit letter or by adding 30 to the Julian calendar date of the TMA or designated audit contractor rebuttal response letter.
(45) 
(45) 
(b) The rebuttal for the healthcare cost audit shall be certified by a responsible official of the contractor as to accuracy and completeness. The rebuttal submission and the rebuttal process used by the contractor shall be subject to review by the Government. The corporation and/or certifying individual may be subject to criminal prosecution for any false certifications made.
(3) Unallowable Costs Recoupment Process
(a) Upon completion of the Annual Healthcare process described above, the Contracting Officer will determine the amount, if any, of unallowable costs / overpayments made by the Contractor; and issue to the Contractor a notice of intent to disallow unallowable costs. The Contractor Officer in said notice will define the method that the Contractor's liability shall be satisfied, i.e. offset; direct reimbursement to the Government, etc.
(b) The Contractor may choose to seek recoupments from its providers for overpayments identified in the AHCC. Such adjustments shall be processed through TEDS. When the MCS contractor submits a TED record cancellation or adjustment due to a recoupment action, the TED system automatically withholds the identified overpayment. For claims that were included in the AHCC universe, this results in the contractor reimbursing the government twice for the same action. The Government recognizes this constitutes a double recoupment action. The following manual process will be utilized to provide reimbursement to the contractor for these double recoupments.
(c) Manual Process For Double Recoupments Arising From AHCC Audits
[1] The Contractor shall submit quarterly reports for all overpayments recouped from records that were included in the audit universe. This report will be due to the Contracting Officer no later than the end of the month following the end of each contract calendar quarter (June 30, September 30, Dec 31, and Mar 31). The report shall identify:
 
 
 
 
[2] Within 60-days of receipt of the report, the Government will validate that the identified records were included in the audit universe, the recoupment/adjusted amount, and the acceptance of the TED record (passes all validity edits) against the TRICARE transactions file. Any TED record that does not meet the reporting criteria and is unable to be validated will be reported back to the contractor with a request for additional information to justify reimbursement.
[3] The contractor will be able to use this process for four full calendar quarters following the sample claim pull for Option Periods II through VIII. For Option Period I, the contractor will be able to use this process for six full calendar quarters following the sample pull. After that date, recoupments that may be eligible for reimbursement to the contractor will be addressed through a formal Request for Equitable Adjustment. For example: If the audit sample is drawn on October 3lst, then the procedure outlined above can be used by the contractor through the full calendar quarter ending December 31st of the following year with the final list of recoupments provided to the Government no later than the last day of the following month when the quarterly report is due.
[4] The initial quarterly review will be based on transactions that have processed and passed all validity edits from the month following the audit extract date up to and through the report receipt date. When TMA has completed its review of the contractor's quarterly report; the contractor will be instructed in writing by the Contracting Officer to invoice the government for all verified claims amounts.
 
H.12. Assumption of Performance in a Second TRICARE Contract Area
TRICARE is a statutory entitlement program under which there can be no lapse in program execution or interruption of services. It is the Government's duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure the ready availability of alternative contract sources to facilitate stability in administration of the statutory entitlement program, help avoid unnecessary disruption in healthcare provider and patient relationships, and insure continuation of critical health services. Recognizing the potential that circumstances may arise under which the Government may require an alternative contractor to assume, on an interim basis, contract performance in one of the three TRICARE contract areas, the Government will consider other options, including substituting contract performance by one or both of the other contractors pending competitive acquisition of a successor. The Government agrees to negotiate in good faith fair and reasonable compensation for the additional work to be performed. The contractor retains all rights to equitable adjustments under the Changes clause in this matter.
