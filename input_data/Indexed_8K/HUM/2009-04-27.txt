Exhibit 99
Humana Reports First Quarter Financial Results
2009 EPS guidance raised to $6.10 to $6.20
Medicare Advantage net membership gains through April 2009 of 46,600
Commercial Segment pretax income up despite lower net investment income
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 27, 2009--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 (1Q09) of $1.22, ahead of managements guidance of $1.10 to $1.20, driven primarily by solid operating performance in both of the companys business segments. The company earned $0.47 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 (1Q08), which reflected high stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) claims expense.
The company also announced that it had raised its EPS projection for the year ending December 31, 2009 (FY09) to a range of $6.10 to $6.20 to reflect improved Government Segment operating performance partially offset by lower expected investment income and commercial membership.
"The first quarter's results are a clear indication that 2009 will be a year of solid performance," said Michael B. McCallister, Humanas president and chief executive officer. "As we look to future years, we are confident that our company's proven ability to respond well to change positions us for continued success in this dynamic environment."
Consolidated Highlights
 1Q09 consolidated revenues rose 11 percent to $7.71 billion from $6.96 billion in 1Q08, with total premium and administrative services fees also up 11 percent compared to the prior years quarter. The increase in premiums and administrative services fees primarily reflects an increase in average membership for the companys Medicare Advantage and commercial medical products together with continued pricing discipline across all of the companys lines of business.
Revenues
 The 1Q09 consolidated benefit ratio (benefit expenses as a percent of premium revenues) was lower than that for the prior years quarter, as expected. The 1Q09 consolidated benefit ratio of 83.9 percent compares to 86.7 percent in 1Q08. This 280 basis point decrease was primarily driven by a 320 basis point decrease in the Government Segment benefit ratio together with a 210 basis point decrease in the Commercial Segment benefit ratio.
Benefit expenses
 The 1Q09 consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums, administrative services fees and other revenue) of 13.9 percent increased 10 basis points compared to the 1Q08 ratio of 13.8 percent due primarily to an increase in the mix of commercial products with traditionally higher administrative cost ratios.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
Government Segment Results
Pretax results:
Government segment pretax income increased to $166.1 million in 1Q09 from a loss of $3.2 million in 1Q08 primarily driven by lower PDP claims expense, a 17 percent increase in average Medicare Advantage membership and the implementation of member premiums for most of the companys Medicare Advantage products.
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership grew to 1,468,900 at March 31, 2009, an increase of 201,200 members, or 16 percent from March 31, 2008, and up 33,000, or 2 percent versus December 31, 2008. The year-over-year increase includes 94,900 members added through acquisitions completed during 2008.
April 2009 membership in the companys Medicare Advantage plans approximated 1,482,500, with 61 percent of those members in network-based products, up from 51 percent at December 31, 2008.
Membership in the companys stand-alone PDPs totaled 2,078,900 at March 31, 2009 compared to 3,150,200 at March 31, 2008 and 3,066,600 at December 31, 2008. The substantial decline during 1Q09 resulted primarily from the companys competitive positioning as it realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit structures to correspond with its pharmacy claims experience.
Military services membership at March 31, 2009 of 2,990,600 was up approximately 2 percent from 2,921,100 at March 31, 2008 and up approximately 1 percent from 2,964,700 at December 31, 2008.
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Medicare Advantage premiums of $4.06 billion in 1Q09 increased 28 percent compared to $3.17 billion in 1Q08, primarily the combined result of a 17 percent increase in average Medicare Advantage membership and the introduction of member premiums.
Medicare stand-alone PDP premiums of $595.7 million in 1Q09 decreased 32 percent compared to $875.0 million in 1Q08, reflecting a 33 percent decline in average membership year over year.
Military services premiums and administrative services fees during 1Q09 increased $60.3 million to $891.5 million compared to $831.2 million in 1Q08.
Benefit Expenses:
The Government Segment benefit ratio decreased 320 basis points to 86.8 percent in 1Q09 compared to 90.0 percent in the prior years quarter, primarily driven by a 430 basis point decline in the Medicare benefit ratio primarily from a substantial decline in the stand-alone PDP benefit ratio.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segments SG&A expense ratio decreased 20 basis points to 10.5 percent in 1Q09 compared to 10.7 percent in the prior years quarter driven primarily by increased leverage from higher average medical membership in the companys Medicare Advantage plans.
Commercial Segment Results
Pretax results:
Commercial Segment pretax earnings increased to $127.7 million in 1Q09 compared to $127.2 million in 1Q08 despite a decline in net investment income of $12.0 million from the prior years quarter.
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership at March 31, 2009 of 3,471,500 was essentially unchanged from March 31, 2008 and down 149,300 from December 31, 2008. The decline during 1Q09 primarily reflected the loss of two large ASO accounts totaling approximately 95,400 members on January 1, 2009 as well as the impact of the economy across various of the companys fully-insured group medical lines of business. The March 31, 2009 membership includes 134,400 members added through acquisitions completed during 2008.
The companys individual product line has continued to grow steadily, with membership of 336,100, up 23 percent at March 31, 2009 compared to March 31, 2008. Smart plans and other consumer offerings membership grew 11 percent year over year to 664,900 at March 31, 2009.
Membership in Commercial Segment specialty products of 6,743,700 at March 31, 2009 declined 2 percent from 6,916,200 at March 31, 2008 and declined 1 percent from 6,817,000 at December 31, 2008, including the loss of dental business associated with one of the large ASO accounts referred to above.
(a)
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment increased 4 percent to $1.88 billion in 1Q09 compared to $1.80 billion in the prior years quarter, as premium yields reflected the companys continued pricing discipline despite flat enrollment year over year.
As expected, Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully-insured group accounts increased approximately 5 percent on a per-member basis during 1Q09 compared to 1Q08.
Benefit Expenses:
The Commercial Segment benefit ratio for 1Q09 of 74.7 percent was 210 basis points lower than the 1Q08 benefit ratio of 76.8 percent, primarily due to year-over-year improvements in the benefit ratios for each of the companys commercial medical business lines. Continued pricing discipline together with a higher percentage of individual and high-deductible health plan members led to the decrease in the Commercial Segment benefit ratio.
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio of 24.1 percent for 1Q09 compares to 22.3 percent in 1Q08, primarily driven by increases in certain of the companys businesses that carry a higher administrative expense load such as specialty businesses and individual medical products.
Balance Sheet
At March 31, 2009, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $7.43 billion, up 3 percent from $7.19 billion at December 31, 2008 and up 13 percent from $6.61 billion at March 31, 2008. Additionally, the company held securities under the companys securities lending program of $331.4 million at March 31, 2009 compared to $402.4 million at December 31, 2008 and $973.9 million at March 31, 2008.
Debt-to-total capitalization at March 31, 2009 was 29.3 percent, down 100 basis points from December 31, 2008 due primarily to the higher capitalization associated with first quarter operating results.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 1Q09 of $45.5 million compared to cash flows provided by operations of $4.4 million in 1Q08 primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital accounts. As expected, first quarter operating cash flows reflected the usual annual pattern of higher operating cash flows in the latter half of the year.
Share Repurchase Program
In the third quarter of 2008, the companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the companys common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. Due to continued volatility and turmoil in the financial markets, the company has not yet repurchased any shares under the third quarter 2008 authorization. The share repurchase program expires on December 31, 2009.
Footnote
The Commercial Segment provides a full range of insured specialty products including dental, vision and other supplemental products. Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products. Other supplemental benefits include life, disability, and fixed benefit products including cancer and critical illness policies.

Cautionary Statement
This news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases like expects, anticipates, intends, likely will result, estimates, projects or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the Risk Factors section of our SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following:
If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana charges are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to its members, or if its estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon its estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate, Humanas profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is extremely sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends.
If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, including its Medicare initiatives, the companys business could be materially adversely affected.
If Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect Humanas proprietary rights to its systems, the companys business could be materially adversely affected.
Humana is involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to Humana, could result in substantial monetary damages. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase the companys cost of doing business.
As a government contractor, Humana is exposed to additional risks including reimbursement and payment changes that could adversely affect its business or its willingness to participate in government health care programs.
Humanas industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative change, could increase Humanas cost of doing business and could adversely affect the companys profitability.
Humana is also subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for its products.
Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper Humanas profitability.
Any failure by Humana to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could have a material adverse effect on its financial results, business and prospects.
If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the companys business could be adversely affected.
Humanas mail order pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses.
Humanas ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.
Downgrades in Humanas debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its cost and availability of funds.
Extreme volatility and disruption in the securities and credit markets may adversely affect Humanas business, results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect Humanas business and results of operations.
Given the current economic climate, Humanas stock and the stock of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.
In making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Humana advises investors to read the following documents as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance:
