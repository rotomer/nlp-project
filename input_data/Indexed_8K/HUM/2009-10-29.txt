As previously disclosed, on July 22, 2009, Humana Military Healthcare Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana Inc. ("Humana"), filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (the "GAO") in connection with the award of the third generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region to another contractor. In its protest, Humana cited discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the Department of Defense (the "DoD") and those that appear to have been used by the DoD in making its contractor selection. On October 28, 2009, Humana learned that the GAO had upheld Humana Military Healthcare Services' protest. The GAO's decision was issued under a protective order, and neither the grounds for the decision nor the nature of the relief recommended by the GAO have yet been disclosed to Humana. Humana expects that the GAO will expeditiously prepare and release a public version of the decision containing that information. At this time, the Company is unable to determine whether the protest decision will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award, and therefore whether or not the protest decision is material.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
