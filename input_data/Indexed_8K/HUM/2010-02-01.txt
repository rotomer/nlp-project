Exhibit 99
Humana Reports Fourth Quarter 2009 Financial Results, Updates 2010 Financial Guidance
Raised 2010 EPS guidance to $5.15 to $5.35
FY09 revenues approximated $31 billion, up 7 percent from prior year
FY09 cash flows from operations of over $1.4 billion
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 1, 2010--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 (4Q09) of $1.48, as compared to $1.03 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 (4Q08), reflecting lower PDP claim expenses in 4Q09 than in 4Q08.
For the year ended December 31, 2009 (FY09) the company reported $6.15 in EPS compared to $3.83 for the year ended December 31, 2008 (FY08). The FY09 results reflected both substantially lower stand-alone PDP claim expenses than in FY08 and higher investment income due to significant realized losses on investmentsduring FY08.
(a)
"We completed a successful 2009 despite a challenging environment," said Michael B. McCallister, president and chief executive officer of Humana. "Looking ahead, we see multiple revenue growth opportunities across our spectrum of products for 2010."
The company now anticipates EPS for the year ending December 31, 2010 (FY10) in the range of $5.15 to $5.35 versus its previous estimate of $5.05 to $5.25. This increase in FY10 EPS guidance primarily reflects the expected retention of the companys South Region TRICARE contract for an additional quarter during FY10.
TRICARE Update
In December 2009, Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc. (HMHS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, was notified by the United States Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) that the TMA intends to exercise its options to extend HMHSs administration of the TRICARE program in TMAs South Region for Option Period VII and Option Period VIII. The exercise of these option periods would effectively extend the TRICARE contract through March 31, 2011.
Additionally in December 2009, the TMA notified the Government Accountability Office (GAO) of its intent to take corrective action in response to the GAOs decision to uphold the companys protest with respect to the July 2009 award of the third generation TRICARE program South Region contract to another contractor. The company is not able to determine whether the protest resolution will change the ultimate outcome of the contract award.
Consolidated Highlights
 4Q09 consolidated revenues rose 2 percent to $7.63 billion from $7.49 billion in 4Q08, with total premium and administrative services fees up 2 percent compared to the prior years quarter. The increase in premiums and administrative services fees primarily reflects an increase in both average Medicare Advantage membership and per-member premiums substantially offset by declines in average Commercial medical membership.
Revenues
Consolidated revenues for FY09 rose 7 percent to $30.96 billion from $28.95 billion for FY08 with total premiums and administrative services fees up 7 percent compared to the prior years period, also driven primarily by the increases in average Medicare Advantage enrollment and per-member premiums.
 The 4Q09 consolidated benefit ratio (benefit expenses as a percent of premium revenues) of 81.8 percent decreased from 83.3 percent for the prior years quarter. This 150 basis point decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of 240 basis points in the Government Segment benefit ratio, partially offset by a 130 basis point increase in the Commercial Segment benefit ratio.
Benefit expenses
The consolidated benefit ratio for FY09 of 82.8 percent was 170 basis points lower than the FY08 consolidated benefit ratio of 84.5 percent, reflecting a 240 basis point decrease in the Government Segments benefit ratio year over year, partially offset by an increase in the Commercial Segments benefit ratio of 30 basis points in FY09 compared to FY08.
 The 4Q09 consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums, administrative services fees and other revenue) of 14.7 percent for 4Q09 compares to 14.8 percent in 4Q08 as the effect of a 60 basis point improvement in this ratio for the Government Segment was substantially offset by a 190 basis point increase for the Commercial Segment.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
The SG&A expense ratio for FY09 of 13.8 percent was 10 basis points higher than that for FY08 of 13.7 percent primarily driven by a 30 basis point improvement in this ratio for the Government Segment being substantially offset by a 170 basis point increase in the Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio.
Government Segment Results
Pretax results:
Government segment pretax income of $452.3 million in 4Q09 compares to $267.3 million in 4Q08. This increase was primarily driven by lower PDP claim expenses, a 6 percent increase in average Medicare Advantage membership, the implementation of member premiums for most of the companys Medicare Advantage products, and higher net investment income.
For FY09, pretax income for the Government Segment of $1.50 billion compares favorably to FY08 pretax income for the segment of $785.2 million. The net increase reflects improved stand-alone PDP operating results, higher operating earnings in the companys Medicare Advantage business and higher net investment income.
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership grew to 1,508,500 at December 31, 2009, an increase of 72,600 members, or 5 percent from 1,435,900 at December 31, 2008, and relatively unchanged from 1,514,800 at September 30, 2009.
January 2010 Medicare Advantage membership approximated 1,729,000 with 71 percent of fully-insured members in network-based products, up from 63 percent of Medicare Advantage membership in such products at December 31, 2009 reflecting growth in both PPO and HMO products.
Membership in the companys stand-alone PDPs totaled 1,927,900 at December 31, 2009 compared to 3,066,600 at December 31, 2008 and 1,960,400 at September 30, 2009. Both the year-over-year and sequential membership declines resulted primarily from attrition associated with low-income senior members. For 2009, the company realigned its stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with its prescription drug claims experience.
January 2010 stand-alone PDP membership declined to approximately 1,780,000, a decrease of approximately 148,000 members from December 31, 2009. This decline resulted primarily from the companys competitive positioning as it continued to align stand-alone PDP premium and benefit structures to correspond with its pharmacy claims experience.
Military services membership at December 31, 2009 of 3,034,400 was up approximately 2 percent from 2,964,700 at December 31, 2008 and slightly up from 3,015,100 at September 30, 2009.
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Medicare Advantage premiums of $4.07 billion in 4Q09 increased 12 percent compared to $3.62 billion in 4Q08, primarily the combined result of a 6 percent increase in average Medicare Advantage membership and the introduction of member premiums for most of the companys Medicare Advantage products.
Medicare stand-alone PDP premiums of $514.8 million in 4Q09 decreased 37 percent compared to $817.5 million in 4Q08, reflecting a 37 percent decline in average membership year over year primarily due to members choosing competitor offerings given the premium and benefit design changes discussed above.
Military services premiums and administrative services fees during 4Q09 increased $12.1 million, or 1 percent, to $858.7 million compared to $846.5 million in 4Q08.
Benefit Expenses:
The Government Segment benefit ratio decreased 240 basis points to 80.9 percent in 4Q09 compared to 83.3 percent in the prior years quarter, primarily driven by a 320 basis point decline in the Medicare benefit ratio primarily from a decrease in the stand-alone PDP benefit ratio together with improved benefit ratios across the companys Medicare Advantage offerings.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 60 basis points to 11.2 percent in 4Q09 compared to 11.8 percent in the prior years quarter primarily driven by increased operating leverage associated with higher average Medicare Advantage enrollment.
Commercial Segment Results
Pretax results:
The Commercial Segment had a pretax loss of $53.6 million in 4Q09 compared to a pretax loss of $6.3 million in 4Q08 primarily reflecting a higher benefit ratio and increased SG&A expenses year over year, partially offset by higher net investment income.
For FY09, pretax earnings for the Commercial Segment of $104.2 million were $103.4 million, or 50 percent lower than FY08 pretax earnings for the segment of $207.6 million driven by higher benefit expenses as a percent of premiums and lower average medical membership, partially offset by higher net investment income.
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership declined to 3,410,800 at December 31, 2009, a decrease of 210,000, or 6 percent, from 3,620,800 at December 31, 2008 and relatively unchanged from 3,426,900 at September 30, 2009. The year-over-year decline primarily reflected the impact of the economic recession and increased unemployment across various of the companys fully-insured group medical lines of business, a competitive environment including the loss of two large ASO accounts totaling approximately 95,400 members on January 1, 2009.
The companys individual medical product line has continued to grow steadily, with membership of 367,400, up 13 percent at December 31, 2009 compared to 325,100 at December 31, 2008 and up 2 percent from 358,800 at September 30, 2009.
January 2010 Commercial Segment medical membership declined approximately 88,000 from that at the end of 2009, with approximately 42 percent of the decline related to self-insured products.
Membership in Commercial Segment specialty products of 7,200,100 at December 31, 2009 increased 7 percent from 6,713,200 at December 31, 2008 and was slightly higher than 7,163,700 at September 30, 2009.
(b)
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment decreased 2 percent to $1.88 billion in 4Q09 compared to $1.92 billion in the prior years quarter, reflecting a 5 percent decline in average medical membership year over year.
Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully-insured group accounts increased approximately 5 percent on a per-member basis during 4Q09 compared to 4Q08.
Benefit Expenses:
In 4Q09, as expected, the Commercial Segment benefits ratio of 84.4 percent increased 130 basis points versus the 4Q08 benefit ratio of 83.1 percent, as an increase in per-member premiums was more than offset by higher utilization primarily associated with the general economy (the average age of smaller group membership, higher utilization prior to termination, and increased COBRA participation) as well as the impact of the H1N1 virus.
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio of 24.9 percent for 4Q09 compares to 23.0 percent in 4Q08, primarily driven by increases in certain of the segments businesses that carry a higher administrative expense load such as mail-order pharmacy, individual medical products, and specialty benefit products.
Balance Sheet
At December 31, 2009, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $9.11 billion, up 5 percent from $8.67 billion at September 30, 2009 and up 27 percent from $7.19 billion at December 31, 2008.
Parent company cash and investments of $665.6 million at December 31, 2009 declined $27.8 million from $693.4 million at September 30, 2009, primarily reflecting subsidiary capital contributions during 4Q09. Cash and investments at the parent increased $415.1 million year over year compared to $250.5 million held at the parent at December 31, 2008 as dividends from subsidiaries more than offset debt repayments and subsidiary capital contributions.
Debt-to-total capitalization at December 31, 2009 was 22.5 percent, down 70 basis points from 23.2 percent at September 30, 2009, and was down 780 basis pointscompared to 30.3 percent at December 31, 2008.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 4Q09 of $274.1 million compared to cash flows provided by operations of $296.6 million in 4Q08 as higher net income was more than offset by uses of cash associated with changes in working capital accounts during 4Q09 compared to 4Q08. FY09 cash flows from operations improved to $1.42 billion versus $982.3 million for FY08 primarily due to higher net income year over year and the positive impact of changes in working capital accounts during FY09 versus those during FY08.
The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis.
(c)
(d)(e)
Share Repurchase Program
In December 2009, the companys Board of Directors renewed its authorization for the use of up to $250 million for the repurchase of Humana common shares. The previous share repurchase authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2009. The renewed authorization is effective until December 31, 2011.
Footnote
(a) Other-than-temporary investment impairments realized in the 2008 third and fourth quarters resulted from portfolio valuations associated with financial market conditions and do not primarily relate to the underwriting or servicing of the companys products.
(b) The Commercial Segment provides a full range of insured specialty products including dental, vision and other supplemental products. Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products. Other supplemental benefits include life, disability, and fixed-benefit products including cancer and critical illness policies.
(c) GAAP is Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
(d) The company believes that the non-GAAP measures included in this release, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
(e) When reviewing and analyzing Humanas operating cash flows, company management applies the CMS premium payment in each month to match the corresponding disbursements. To do otherwise distorts meaningful analysis of the companys operating cash flow. Therefore, decisions such as managements forecasting and business plans regarding cash flow use this non-GAAP financial measure.

Cautionary Statement
This news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of the companys executive officers, the words or phrases like expects, anticipates, believes, intends, likely will result, estimates, projects or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the Risk Factors section of the companys SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following:
Humanas business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application, could increase the companys cost of doing business and could materially affect its business, profitability and financial condition. In addition, as a government contractor, the company is exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect its business or its willingness to participate in government health care programs. The President of the United States and members of the U.S. Congress have proposed significant reforms to the U.S. health care system. Because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives and the numerous steps required to implement them, the company cannot predict what health insurance initiative, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation will have on Humanas business. However, an expansion in governments role in the U.S. health care industry may lower the companys Medicare payments and adversely affect its business and results of operations, possibly materially. In addition, new excise or income taxes imposed by such initiatives may affect the companys effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on Humanas results of operations.
If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana charges are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to its members, or if its estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon its estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate, Humanas profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is extremely sensitive to payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends.
If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, including its Medicare initiatives, the companys business could be materially adversely affected.
If Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect Humanas proprietary rights to its systems, the companys business could be materially adversely affected.
Humana is involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to Humana, could result in substantial monetary damages. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase the companys cost of doing business.
Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper Humanas profitability.
Any failure by Humana to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could have a material adverse effect on its financial results, business and prospects.
If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the companys business could be adversely affected.
Humanas mail order pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses.
Humanas ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries is restricted.
Downgrades in Humanas debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect Humanas business and results of operations.
The securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which could adversely affect the companys business.
Given the current economic climate, Humanas stock and the stock of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.
In making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Humana advises investors to read the following documents as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance:
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008;
Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009, and September 30, 2009;
Form 8-Ks filed during 2009 and 2010.
