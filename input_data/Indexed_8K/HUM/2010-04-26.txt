Exhibit 99
Humana Reports First Quarter Financial Results
1Q10 results of $1.52 include $0.37 per share in higher-than-expected favorable prior-period reserve development
2010 EPS guidance raised to $5.55 to $5.65
Medicare Advantage membership now approximates 1.75 million
1Q10 cash flows from operations of $755 million
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2010--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 (1Q10) of $1.52, ahead of managements guidance of $1.10 to $1.20. EPS for 1Q10 included earnings of approximately $0.37 per share from higher-than-anticipated favorable prior-period development of medical claims reserves as well as $0.04 per share in higher-than-projected income tax expense due to recently enacted health reform legislation. Excluding these items, 1Q10 EPS was at the top end of the companys previous guidance range. The 1Q10 results compared to EPS of $1.22 for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 (1Q09).
The company also announced that it had raised its EPS projection for the year ending December 31, 2010 (FY10) to a range of $5.55 to $5.65 versus its previous EPS estimate of $5.15 to $5.35 primarily to reflect the impact of the favorable prior-period reserve development impacting 1Q10 earnings noted above, partially offset by the higher effective tax rate now anticipated.
Our first quarter results demonstrate solid execution in both of our business segments, said Michael B. McCallister, Humanas president and chief executive officer. We believe strategic and tactical initiatives over the past several years, together with our continued focus on the consumer, position us well for the remainder of 2010 and for the challenges of the post-health-reform environment.
Consolidated Highlights
 1Q10 consolidated revenues rose 9.5 percent to $8.44 billion from $7.71 billion in 1Q09, with total premium and administrative services fees up 9.2 percent compared to the prior years quarter. The year-over-year increase in premiums and administrative services fees primarily reflects a 19 percent increase in average membership for the companys Medicare Advantage plans and continued pricing discipline across all of the companys lines of business, partially offset by lower average stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) and commercial fully-insured medical membership.
Revenues
 The 1Q10 consolidated benefit ratio (benefit expenses as a percent of premium revenues) of 83.4 percent compares to 83.9 percent in 1Q09. This 50 basis point decrease was driven by declines in the benefit ratio in both of the companys business segments.
Benefit expenses
 The 1Q10 consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums, administrative services fees and other revenue) of 13.5 percent decreased 40 basis points compared to the 1Q09 ratio of 13.9 percent due primarily to efficiencies associated with higher average Medicare Advantage membership together with the companys continued focus on administrative cost reductions.
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses
Government Segment Results
Pretax results:
Government segment pretax income increased to $279.2 million in 1Q10 from $166.1 million in 1Q09. The 1Q10 results included the benefit of $85.9 million in favorable prior-period reserve development and also reflected higher average Medicare Advantage membership year over year as well as improved operating metrics.
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership grew to 1,742,300 at March 31, 2010, an increase of 273,400 members, or 19 percent from March 31, 2009, and up 233,800, or 16 percent versus December 31, 2009.
April 2010 membership in the companys Medicare Advantage plans approximated 1,750,900, with 72 percent of fully-insured members in network-based products, up from 63 percent at December 31, 2009.
Membership in the companys stand-alone PDPs totaled 1,917,100 at March 31, 2010 compared to 2,078,900 at March 31, 2009 and 1,927,900 at December 31, 2009. The decline during 1Q10 primarily resulted from the companys continued competitive positioning as it realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with its pharmacy claims experience.
Military services membership at March 31, 2010 of 3,031,400 was up approximately 1 percent from 2,990,600 at March 31, 2009 and essentially unchanged from 3,034,400 at December 31, 2009.
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Medicare Advantage premiums and administrative service fees of $4.82 billion in 1Q10 increased 19 percent compared to $4.06 billion in 1Q09, primarily due to a 19 percent increase in average Medicare Advantage membership.
Medicare stand-alone PDP premiums of $579.0 million in 1Q10 decreased 3 percent compared to $595.7 million in 1Q09, reflecting a 13 percent decline in average membership year over year, partially offset by an 11 percent increase in premiums per member per month.
Military services premiums and administrative services fees during 1Q10 decreased $22.1 million to $867.3 million compared to $889.4 million in 1Q09.
Benefit Expenses:
The Government Segment benefit ratio decreased 80 basis points to 86.0 percent in 1Q10 compared to 86.8 percent in the prior years quarter, primarily driven by a 130 basis point benefit from higher-than-anticipated favorable prior-period reserve development. The increase in the benefit ratio excluding this favorable reserve development is primarily due to growth in the companys Medicare Advantage group business which generally carries a higher benefit ratio than the companys individual Medicare Advantage business.
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segments SG&A expense ratio decreased 40 basis points to 10.1 percent in 1Q10 compared to 10.5 percent in the prior years quarter driven primarily by increased efficiencies from higher average medical membership in the companys Medicare Advantage plans and the companys continued focus on administrative cost reductions.
Commercial Segment Results
Pretax results:
Commercial Segment pretax earnings increased to $137.8 million in 1Q10 compared to $127.7 million in 1Q09 primarily driven by the benefit of $14.1 million in higher-than-anticipated favorable prior-period reserve development during 1Q10, partially offset by the effect of an 8 percent decline in average fully-insured commercial medical membership from the prior years quarter.
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership at March 31, 2010 of 3,331,500 was down 140,000 from March 31, 2009 and down 79,300 from December 31, 2009. The decline during 1Q10 primarily reflected the impact of the economy across various of the companys fully-insured group medical lines of business.
The companys individual product line has continued to grow steadily, with membership of 370,500, up 10 percent at March 31, 2010 compared to March 31, 2009.
Membership in Commercial Segment specialty products of 7,237,900 at March 31, 2010 increased 11 percent from 6,535,100 at March 31, 2009 and up 2 percent from 7,109,900 at December 31, 2009.
(a)
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment decreased 2 percent to $1.85 billion in 1Q10 compared to $1.88 billion in the prior years quarter, reflecting lower average medical membership partially offset by continued pricing discipline.
Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully-insured group accounts increased approximately 8 percent on a per-member basis during 1Q10 compared to 1Q09.
Benefit Expenses:
The Commercial Segment benefit ratio for 1Q10 of 74.1 percent was 60 basis points lower than the 1Q09 benefit ratio of 74.7 percent, primarily due to an 80 basis point benefit from higher-than-expected favorable prior-period reserve development during 1Q10.
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment SG&A expense ratio of 24.8 percent for 1Q10 compares to 24.1 percent in 1Q09, primarily driven by increases in the companys specialty, ancillary and individual medical businesses that carry a higher administrative expense load as a percent of revenues, partially offset by the companys continued focus on administrative cost reductions.
Balance Sheet
At March 31, 2010, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $9.91 billion, up 9 percent from $9.11 billion at December 31, 2009 and up 33 percent from $7.43 billion at March 31, 2009.
Parent company cash and investments of $729.8 million at March 31, 2010 increased $64.2 million from $665.6 million at December 31, 2009.
Debt-to-total capitalization at March 31, 2010 was 21.6 percent, down 90 basis points from December 31, 2009 due primarily to the increase in capitalization associated with net income during 1Q10.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 1Q10 of $754.7 million compared to cash flows provided by operations of $45.5 million in 1Q09 with the year-over-year increase primarily due to higher medical claims reserve balances associated with higher average Medicare Advantage membership and increased claims inventories on hand together with other working capital changes during 1Q10 versus the prior years quarter.

Cautionary Statement
This news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humanas executive officers, the words or phrases like expects, anticipates, intends, likely will result, estimates, projects or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the Risk Factors section of the companys SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following:
Recently enacted health care reform, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humanas results of operations, including lowering the companys Medicare payment rates and increasing the companys expenses associated with a non-deductible federal premium tax; financial position, including goodwill recoverability; and cash flows. In addition, if the new non-deductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted, and if Humana is unable to adjust its business model to address this new tax, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana charges are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to its members, or if its estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate, Humanas profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is extremely sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends.
If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, including its Medicare initiatives, the companys business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of the companys revenues in the Medicare business.
If Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect Humanas proprietary rights to its systems, the companys business may be materially adversely affected.
Humana is involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to Humana, could result in substantial monetary damages. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase the companys cost of doing business.
Humanas business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application, could increase the companys cost of doing business and may adversely affect the companys business, profitability and financial condition. In addition, as a government contractor, Humana is exposed to additional risks that may adversely affect the companys business or the companys willingness to participate in government health care programs.
Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper Humanas profitability.
Any failure by Humana to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the companys business may be adversely affected.
Humanas mail order pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses.
Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humanas financial performance.
If Humana does not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, Humanas gross margins may decline.
Humanas ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.
Downgrades in Humanas debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect Humanas business and results of operations.
The securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect Humanas business.
Given the current economic climate, Humanas stock and the stock of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.
In making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Humana advises investors to read the following documents as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance:
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009;
Form 8-Ks filed during 2010.
