Exhibit 99
Humana Reports Second Quarter 2010 Financial Results
2Q10 EPS of $2.00 included asset impairment expenses and favorable prior-period reserve development
Improved operating earnings year over year in both business segments
YTD cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion
June 2010 parent company cash and investments of $1.0 billion
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 2, 2010--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 (2Q10) of $2.00, above managements guidance of $1.65 to $1.70. The 2Q10 results compared to EPS of $1.67 for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 (2Q09). For the six months ended June 30, 2010 (1H10) the company reported $3.52 in EPS compared to $2.89 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 (1H09).
The company raised its EPS guidance for the year ending December 31, 2010 (FY10E) to a range of $5.65 to $5.75 from its previous range of $5.55 to $5.65 as a result of its 2Q10 performance and its revised forecast for the second half of 2010.
We are pleased with this quarter's performance as it is the result of strength in both our Commercial and Government segments, said Michael B. McCallister, Humanas president and chief executive officer. It is clear our value proposition for seniors in Medicare continues to be well received across the country.
The company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures for 2Q10 and 1H10 throughout this earnings press release. Consolidated non-GAAP pretax income and EPS were as follows:
(a)
(a)
Consolidated Highlights
 2Q10 consolidated revenues rose 10 percent to $8.65 billion from $7.90 billion in 2Q09, with total premium and administrative services fees also up 10 percent compared to the prior years quarter. The year-over-year increase in premiums and administrative services fees primarily reflects an 18 percent increase in average membership for the companys Medicare Advantage plans and continued pricing discipline across all of the companys lines of business, partially offset by lower average stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) and commercial fully-insured group medical membership.
Revenues
1H10 consolidated revenues rose 9 percent to $17.09 billion from $15.61 billion in 1H09 with total premium and administrative services fees also up 9 percent compared to the prior years period, also driven primarily by the same factors as the second quarter year-over-year increase.
The impact of GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation items on the consolidated benefit ratio (benefit expenses as a percent of premium revenues) is detailed in the following table:
Benefit expenses 
(a)
The 2Q10 consolidated benefit ratio of 81.9 percent compares to 83.3 percent in 2Q09. On a non-GAAPbasis the 2Q10 consolidated benefit ratio of 83.3 percent was unchanged versus the 2Q09 consolidated benefit ratio. The non-GAAPconsolidated benefit ratio for 2Q10 reflected the combined impact of a 120 basis point increase in the non-GAAP benefit ratio for the Government Segment and a 520 basis point improvement in the non-GAAP benefit ratio for the Commercial Segment. The drivers of these changes are detailed in the segment discussions below.
(a)
(a)
(a)
(a)
The consolidated benefits ratio for 1H10 of 82.6 percent was 100 basis points lower than the 1H09 consolidated benefits ratio of 83.6 percent. On a non-GAAPbasis the 1H10 consolidated benefits ratio of 83.5 percent improved 10 basis points from 83.6 percent for 1H09, the combined impact of a 50 basis point increase in the non-GAAP benefit ratio for the Government Segment and a 320 basis point improvement in the non-GAAP benefit ratio for the Commercial Segment. These non-GAAPchanges were primarily driven by the same factors impacting the second quarter year-over-year comparisons.
(a)
(a)
(a)
(a)
The impact of GAAP to non-GAAPreconciliation items on the consolidated SG&A expense ratio (SG&A expenses as a percent of premiums, administrative services fees and other revenue) is detailed in the following table:
Selling, general, & administrative (SG&A) expenses 
(a)
The 2Q10 consolidated SG&A expense ratio of 13.6 percent increased 80 basis points compared to the 2Q09 ratio of 12.8 percent. On a non-GAAPbasis the consolidated SG&A expense ratio of 11.8 percent improved 100 basis points versus the 2Q09 ratio of 12.8 percent reflecting both scale efficiencies associated with higher average Medicare Advantage membership and the companys continued focus on administrative cost reductions.
(a)
The SG&A expense ratio for 1H10 of 13.5 percent also increased 10 basis points from that for 1H09 of 13.4 percent. On a non-GAAPbasis the consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 1H10 of 12.6 percent improved 80 basis points from 13.4 percent for 1H09 primarily reflecting the same factors impacting the second quarter year-over-year comparison.
(a)
Government Segment Results
The impact of GAAP to non-GAAPreconciliation items on Government Segment financial measures is detailed in the following table:
(a)
Pretax results:
On a non-GAAPbasis, Government Segment pretax income increased to $451.2 million in 2Q10 from $404.7 million in 2Q09 primarily due to higher average Medicare Advantage membership year-over-year and a lower SG&A expense ratio. The lower SG&A expense ratio resulted from economies of scale from higher average membership and a continued focus on administrative cost reductions.
(a)
For 1H10, non-GAAPpretax earnings for the Government Segment of $696.9 million increased by $126.1 million versus 1H09 pretax earnings for the segment of $570.8 million, primarily reflecting the same factors as those affecting the quarterly year-over-year comparisons.
(a)
Enrollment:
Medicare Advantage membership grew to 1,761,100 at June 30, 2010, an increase of 261,300 members, or 17 percent, from June 30, 2009, and up 252,600, or 17 percent, during 1H10.
As of June 30, 2010, 72 percent of fully-insured Medicare Advantage members were in network-based products, unchanged from the March 31, 2010 percentage and 9 percent higher than the 63 percent of such membership in networked Medicare Advantage options at December 31, 2009.
Membership in the companys stand-alone PDPs totaled 1,793,400 at June 30, 2010 compared to 1,992,000 at June 30, 2009 and 1,927,900 at December 31, 2009. The 2010 year-to-date decline primarily resulted from the companys continued competitive positioning as it realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with its pharmacy claims experience.
Military services membership at June 30, 2010 of 3,030,700 was up approximately 1 percent from 3,008,300 at June 30, 2009 and essentially unchanged from 3,034,400 at December 31, 2009.
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Medicare Advantage premiums and administrative service fees of $4.89 billion in 2Q10 increased 18 percent compared to $4.15 billion in 2Q09, primarily due to an 18 percent increase in average Medicare Advantage membership year over year.
Medicare stand-alone PDP premiums of $700.2 million in 2Q10 increased 10 percent compared to $638.8 million in 2Q09, reflecting an 18 percent increase in premiums per member per month, partially offset by a 7 percent decline in average membership year over year.
Military services premiums and administrative services fees during 2Q10 decreased $38.7 million to $907.9 million compared to $946.6 million in 2Q09.
Benefit Expenses:
On a non-GAAPbasis the Government Segment benefit ratio of 85.3 percent increased 120 basis points versus the 2Q09 ratio of 84.1 percent primarily due to an increase in Medicare Advantage group business (which generally carries a higher benefit ratio than the companys individual Medicare Advantage business).
(a)
SG&A Expenses:
The Government Segments SG&A expense ratio decreased 110 basis points to 8.2 percent in 2Q10 compared to 9.3 percent in the prior years quarter driven primarily by increased scale efficiencies from higher average medical membership in the companys Medicare Advantage plans and the companys continued focus on administrative cost reductions.
Commercial Segment Results
The impact of GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation items on Commercial Segment financial measures is detailed in the following table:
(a)
Pretax results:
On a non-GAAPbasis, Commercial Segment pretax income increased to $115.2 million in 2Q10 compared to $35.3 million in 2Q09 due to pricing discipline, lower levels of health care services utilization and the companys continued focus on administrative cost reductions.
(a)
For 1H10, non-GAAPpretax income for the Commercial Segment of $265.9 million compared to earnings of $162.9 million for 1H09 primarily reflecting the same factors as those affecting the quarterly year-over-year comparisons.
(a)
Enrollment:
Commercial Segment medical membership at June 30, 2010 of 3,285,100 was down 162,800 from June 30, 2009 and down 125,700 year-to-date 2010. The year-over-year declines during both 2Q10 and 1H10 primarily reflected continued pricing discipline across the companys fully-insured medical lines of business.
Membership in Commercial Segment specialty products of 7,297,000 at June 30, 2010 increased 11 percent from 6,585,800 at June 30, 2009 and up 3 percent from 7,109,900 at December 31, 2009.
(d)
Premiums and administrative services fees:
Premiums and administrative services fees for the Commercial Segment decreased 2 percent to $1.84 billion in 2Q10 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior years quarter, reflecting lower average medical membership partially offset by continued pricing discipline.
Commercial Segment medical premiums for fully-insured group accounts increased approximately 8 percent on a per-member basis during 2Q10 compared to 2Q09.
Benefit Expenses:
The Commercial Segment non-GAAPbenefit ratio for 2Q10 of 75.6 percent was 520 basis points lower than the 2Q09 benefit ratio of 80.8 percent, primarily due to lower levels of health care services utilization year over year and continued pricing discipline.
(a)
SG&A Expenses:
The Commercial Segment non-GAAPSG&A expense ratio of 24.4 percent for 2Q10 compares to 23.5 percent in 2Q09 as increases in the companys specialty, ancillary and individual medical businesses (that carry a higher administrative expense load as a percent of revenues) were partially offset by the companys continued focus on administrative cost reductions.
(a)
Balance Sheet
At June 30, 2010, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $10.29 billion, a 4 percent increase from $9.91 billion at March 31, 2010.
Parent company cash and investments of $1.00 billion at June 30, 2010 increased $271.8 million from $729.8 million at March 31, 2010 as dividends from subsidiaries were partially offset primarily by federal income tax and interest payments as well as share repurchases during 2Q10.
Debt-to-total capitalization at June 30, 2010 was 20.5 percent, down 110 basis points from March 31, 2010 due primarily to the increase in capitalization associated with increased net income during 2Q10.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 2Q10 of $325.3 million compared to cash flows provided by operations of $161.9 million in 2Q09 with the year-over-year increase primarily due to higher net income year over year.
Share Repurchase Program
In December 2009, the companys Board of Directors renewed its authorization for the use of up to $250 million for the repurchase of Humana common shares. During 2Q10, the company repurchased 1,025,000 of its outstanding shares at an average price per share of $48.76. As of August 1, 2010, the company had approximately $200 million remaining on the December 2009 authorization, which is effective until December 31, 2011.

Cautionary Statement
This news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humanas executive officers, the words or phrases like expects, anticipates, intends, likely will result, estimates, projects or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the Risk Factors section of the companys SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following:
Recently enacted health insurance reform, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humanas results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, increasing the company's medical and administrative costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio, lowering the companys Medicare payment rates and increasing the companys expenses associated with a non-deductible federal premium tax; financial position, including the company's ability to maintain the value of its goodwill; and cash flows. In addition, if the new non-deductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted, and if Humana is unable to adjust its business model to address this new tax, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana charges are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to its members, or if its estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate, Humanas profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is extremely sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends.
If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, including its Medicare initiatives, the companys business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of the companys revenues in the Medicare business.
If Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect Humanas proprietary rights to its systems, the companys business may be materially adversely affected.
Humana is involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to Humana, could result in substantial monetary damages. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase the companys cost of doing business.
Humanas business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application, could increase the companys cost of doing business and may adversely affect the companys business, profitability and financial condition. In addition, as a government contractor, Humana is exposed to additional risks that may adversely affect the companys business or the companys willingness to participate in government health care programs.
Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper Humanas profitability.
Any failure by Humana to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the companys business may be adversely affected.
Humanas mail order pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses.
Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humanas financial performance.
If Humana does not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, Humanas gross margins may decline.
Humanas ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.
Downgrades in Humanas debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect Humanas business and results of operations.
The securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect Humanas business.
Given the current economic climate, Humanas stock and the stock of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.
In making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Humana advises investors to read the following documents as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance:
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009;
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010;
Form 8-Ks filed during 2010.
