On October 5, 2010, Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc. ("HMHS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana Inc. ("Humana" or the "Company") was notified by the United States Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity ("TMA") that the TMA intends to negotiate with HMHS for an extension of HMHS's administration of the TRICARE program in TMA's South Region (the "TRICARE Contract"), comprising of a one year option period from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012.
Discussions are still at a preliminary stage, but Humana no longer anticipates incurring the previously expected expenses of between $0.19 and $0.28 per diluted common share during the year ending December 31, 2010 ("FY 2010") related to the previously anticipated loss of the TRICARE Contract on March 31, 2011 and therefore the Company's previously issued FY 2010 financial guidance should no longer be relied upon. Such expenses may, however, be incurred in future periods, depending on the ultimate disposition of future contact awards, as previously disclosed. The Company anticipates updating its FY 2010 financial guidance for this and other material developments, if any, on November 1, 2010 in connection with its release of financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. Further, financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2011 is expected to be issued in conjunction with Humana's biennial Investor Meeting to be held November 18, 2010.
HMHS provides health benefits support and services to approximately 3.0 million active duty and retired military and their eligible family members in the ten-state South Region.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Dated: October 7, 2010
