JP Morgan Health Care Conference
 
As previously disclosed, on January 11, 2011, officers of Humana Inc. (the Company) will be meeting with investors and analysts at an industry conference. During the meetings, the Company intends to address its prospects and performance. The Company expects gross sales for Medicare Advantage for 2011 to be modestly higher than expected, with net growth slightly higher than the Companys previous expectation of 60,000 to 65,000.  Gross sales for stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans are expected to be higher than expected with respect to the Humana-Walmart Preferred plan, and in line with previous projections with respect to the Companys other plans. Net growth in the Companys stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans is expected to be higher than the Companys previous expectation of 325,000 to 3 75,000. The Company is continuing to receive January 2011 disenrollment data for all Medicare plans from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), consistent with historical disenrollment reporting patterns from CMS.  Initial data indicates attrition generally consistent with previously expectations in the Companys Medicare Advantage program, and slightly lower than previously expected with respect to the Companys stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans.
 
The Company will also note that in December 2010, CMS issued a draft audit methodology with respect to Risk-Adjustment Validation Audits, or RADV audits, of selected Medicare Advantage plans to validate the provider coding practices and resulting economics under the actuarial risk-adjustment model used to calculate the individual member capitation paid to Medicare Advantage plans.  Comments on the draft methodology are due January 21, 2011.
 
The Company will not opine on earnings per share (EPS) expectations for 2010 and 2011 at this conference since it is in the process of closing its books for 2010.
 
 
TRICARE
 
As previously disclosed, on October 5, 2010, Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc. (HMHS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana Inc. (Humana or the Company) was notified by the United States Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) that the TMA intended to negotiate with HMHS for an extension of HMHSs administration of the TRICARE program in TMAs South Region (the TRICARE Contract), comprising of a one year option period from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012.
 
An Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract (the Amendment) to the TRICARE Contract between HMHS and TMA, in the form of an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA), became effective as of January 6, 2011.  A copy of the Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Amendment adds one additional one-year option period, Option Period IX (which runs from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012).  In addition, the Amendment updates the contract terms and conditions to incorporate the additional option period and align the clauses governing the Amendment with the latest version of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.  The Amendment does not include the costs of the underwritten target health care cost and underwritten health care target fee, which will be negotiated separately.
 
The effect of this Amendment has already been included in the Companys consolidated earnings per diluted common share guidance for the year ending December 31, 2011 of $5.45 to $5.65, previously disclosed on December 21, 2010.
 
The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the complete terms and conditions of the Amendment, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Dated:           January 10, 2011
