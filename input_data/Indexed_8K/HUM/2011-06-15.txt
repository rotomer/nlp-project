LOUISVILLE, Ky.  June 15, 2011 Humana Military Healthcare Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM), announced today that it has received notification of the decision by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to uphold the award of the South Region TRICARE Third Generation (T-3) contract to Humana Military by the Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), rejecting the protest initiated by a competing bidder.
In late February 2011, TMA selected Humana Military for award of the T-3 contract.  In March, a competing bidder filed a protest with the GAO.  Humana believes further details regarding the ruling by the GAO will be released in the near future.
The new contract is scheduled to begin on April 1, 2012.  As is customary, it provides for five one-year options annually exercisable by the Department of Defense.
