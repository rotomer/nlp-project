Exhibit 99
Humana Reports Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results
Second quarter EPS of $2.71 included $0.21 of favorable prior-period reserve development
Full-year 2011 EPS raised to $7.50 to $7.60
1H11 cash flows from operations of $957 million
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 1, 2011--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 (2Q11) of $2.71, compared to $2.00 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 (2Q10). For the six months ended June 30, 2011 (1H11) the company reported $4.57 in EPS compared to $3.52 for the six months ended June 30, 2010 (1H10). Comparison of operating results for these periods is affected by the items noted below:
The company also today raised its EPS guidance for the year ending December 31, 2011 (FY11) to a range of $7.50 to $7.60 versus its previous estimate of $6.70 to $6.90. This increase in FY11 EPS guidance primarily reflects lower projected benefit expense ratios in the companys Retail and Employer Group Segments partially offset by higher projected Medicare sales and marketing reinvestments as well as expenses designed to enhance the companys Star ratings positioning and clinical initiatives.
This quarters results demonstrate our on-going commitment to operational excellence across all of our lines of business, progress with our 15 Percent Solution and the continuation of low utilization of medical services primarily in our commercial business," said Michael B. McCallister, Humanas chairman of the board and chief executive officer. We believe the reinvestment spending we intend to make in the back half of 2011 will further position us for success in 2012 and beyond."
Consolidated Highlights
 2Q11 consolidated revenues were $9.28 billion, an increase of 8 percent from $8.59 billion in 2Q10, with total premiums and services revenue also up 8 percent compared to the prior years quarter. The year-over-year increase in premiums and services revenue primarily reflected an increase in the revenues in both the companys Retail and Health and Well-Being Services segments, partially offset by a decline in revenues in the companys Employer Group segment.
Revenues
1H11 consolidated revenues rose 9 percent to $18.47 billion from $16.97 billion in 1H10 with total premiums and services revenue also up 9 percent compared to the prior years period, driven primarily by the same factors as the second quarter year-over-year increase.
 The 2Q11 consolidated benefit ratio (benefit expenses as a percent of premiums) of 82.2 percent increased by 20 basis points from 82.0 percent for the prior years quarter due primarily to lower favorable prior-period medical claims development than the prior year. The consolidated benefit ratio for 1H11 of 83.0 percent increased by 20 basis points from the 1H10 consolidated benefit ratio of 82.8 percent.
Benefit expenses
Favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development impacted the consolidated benefit ratio year-over-year comparisons as follows:
The year-over-year improvement in the non-GAAP consolidated benefit ratio for the second quarter reflects the companys dedication to continual operational improvement. This non-GAAP metric was flat for the first half of the year versus the prior years period as a result of a significant increase in the companys stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP) membership for 2011. The stand-alone PDP product design carries a higher benefit ratio in the first quarter than other quarters throughout the year.
 The consolidated operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percent of total revenues less investment income) of 13.0 percent for 2Q11 compares to 12.9 percent in 2Q10 primarily reflecting a 3 percent increase in the portion of the companys revenues derived from its Health and Well-Being Services Segment, which carries a higher operating cost ratio than the companys other business segments.
Operating costs
The 1H11 consolidated operating cost ratio of 13.4 percent increased 60 basis points from that for 1H10 of 12.8 percent primarily due to the same factor impacting the second quarter year-over-year comparison.
The write-down of certain DAC during 2Q10 impacted the consolidated year-over-year operating cost ratio comparisons as follows:
The non-GAAP consolidated operating cost ratio increased versus the prior year for both the second quarter and first half of the year due to the companys December 2010 acquisition of Concentra, Inc. (Concentra).
Retail Segment Highlights
Pretax results:
Retail Segment pretax income of $503.1 million in 2Q11 compares to $325.9 million in 2Q10. This increase was primarily due to increased average membership. For 1H11, pretax earnings for the Retail Segment of $720.1 million increased by $129.3 million versus 1H10 pretax earnings for the segment of $590.7 million. Comparison of operating results for these periods was also affected by the items noted below:
Enrollment:
Individual Medicare Advantage membership was 1,602,500 at June 30, 2011, an increase of 139,600 members, or 10 percent from 1,462,900 at June 30, 2010 primarily due to a successful enrollment season associated with the 2011 plan year. Individual Medicare Advantage membership has increased 141,800 or 10 percent through 1H11 from 1,460,700 at December 31, 2010.
Membership in the companys individual stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) was 2,408,700 at June 30, 2011, up 700,700 or 41 percent compared to 1,708,000 at June 30, 2010 and up 738,400 or 44 percent from 1,670,300 at December 31, 2010. These increases resulted from higher gross sales primarily during the 2011 enrollment season, particularly for the companys low-price-point Humana-Walmart plan offering.
One medical membership increased to 403,700 at June 30, 2011, an increase of 32,200, or 9 percent, from 371,500 at June 30, 2010 and an increase of 31,400 or 8 percent, from 372,300 at December 31, 2010.
Humana
Membership in individual specialty products of 680,500 at June 30, 2011 increased 55 percent from 440,400 at June 30, 2010 and up 170,500 or 33 percent from 510,000 at December 31, 2010 driven primarily by increased sales in dental and vision offerings.
(d)
Premiums and services revenue:
2Q11 premiums and services revenue for the Retail Segment were $5.40 billion, an increase of 12 percent from $4.82 billion in 2Q10. The increase was primarily the result of 9 percent higher average Medicare Advantage membership year over year.
Benefit expenses:
The 2Q11 benefit ratio for the Retail Segment was 81.4 percent, an improvement of 10 basis points from 81.5 percent in 2Q10. Favorable prior-period reserve development impacted the year-over-year comparison of the benefit ratio for this segment as follows:
Operating costs:
The Retail Segments operating cost ratio of 9.1 percent in 2Q11 improved 240 basis points from 11.5 percent in 2Q10. The write-down of certain DAC during 2Q10 impacted the year-over-year comparison of the operating cost ratio for this segment as follows:
On a non-GAAP basis, the Retail Segments operating cost ratio increased year over year, primarily reflecting a higher percentage of the segments membership in the Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan which carries a higher operating cost ratio than other stand-alone PDP products.
Employer Group Segment Highlights
Pretax results:
Employer Group Segment pretax income of $108.4 million in 2Q11 compares to $107.8 million in 2Q10. For 1H11, pretax earnings for the Employer Group Segment of $247.2 million increased by $65.9 million versus 1H10 pretax earnings for the segment of $181.2 million. Favorable prior-period reserve development impacted the year-over-year comparisons of the pretax income for this segment as follows:
Enrollment:
Group Medicare Advantage membership was 309,700 at June 30, 2011, an increase of 11,500 members, or 4 percent, from 298,200 at June 30, 2010, and an increase of 8,400 or 3 percent, from 301,300 at December 31, 2010.
Group fully-insured commercial medical membership declined to 1,186,200 at June 30, 2011, a decrease of 109,200 or 8 percent, from 1,295,400 at June 30, 2010, and a decrease of 66,000 or 5 percent, from 1,252,200 at December 31, 2010. This decline primarily reflected the companys continued dedication to pricing discipline in a highly competitive environment for large group business partially offset by small group business membership gains.
Group administrative services only, or ASO, commercial medical membership declined to 1,313,600 at June 30, 2011, a decrease of 269,000 or 17 percent from 1,582,600 at June 30, 2010, and a decrease of 140,000 or 10 percent, from 1,453,600 at December 31, 2010. This decline reflected the loss of a large ASO account in July 2010 and a continuation of discipline in pricing services for self-funded accounts amid a highly competitive environment.
Membership in Employer Group specialty products of 6,669,600 at June 30, 2011 decreased 2 percent from 6,806,900 at June 30, 2010, and increased 152,100 or 2 percent, from 6,517,500 at December 31, 2010.
(d)
Premiums and services revenue:
2Q11 premiums and services revenue for the Employer Group Segment were $2.30 billion, a decrease of 4 percent from $2.40 billion in 2Q10. The decrease was primarily the result of a 14 percent decline in average commercial group medical membership year-over-year.
Benefit expenses:
2Q11 benefit ratio for the Employer Group Segment was 81.2 percent, unchanged from that for 2Q10. Favorable prior-period reserve development impacted the year-over-year comparison of the benefit ratio for this segment as follows:
The 250 basis point year-over year improvement in the Employer Group Segments non-GAAP benefit ratio reflects a continuation of low utilization of medical services, particularly in the companys commercial business, combined with a higher percentage of the segments membership in small group accounts which generally have a lower benefit ratio than larger group accounts.
Operating costs:
The Employer Group Segments operating cost ratio of 16.8 percent in 2Q11 improved from 17.2 percent in 2Q10 primarily reflecting administrative scale efficiencies associated with a 5 percent increase in average fully-insured Medicare Advantage group membership.
Health and Well-Being Services Segment Highlights
Pretax results:
Health and Well-Being Services Segment pretax income of $87.8 million in 2Q11 increased 73 percent compared to $50.9 million in 2Q10 reflecting growth in the companys pharmacy solutions business as well as the addition of the Concentra business acquired in December 2010.
For 1H11, pretax earnings for the Health and Well-Being Services Segment of $184.2 million increased by $85.1 million versus 1H10 pretax earnings for the segment of $99.1 million, reflecting the same factors as those affecting the quarterly year-over-year comparisons.
Revenues:
Revenues of $2.73 billion in 2Q11 for the Health and Well-Being Services Segment increased 22 percent from $2.23 billion in 2Q10. This increase was primarily due to growth in the companys pharmacy solutions business together with the December 2010 acquisition of the companys Concentra business.
Operating costs:
The Health and Well-Being Services Segments operating cost ratio of 96.1 percent in 2Q11 improved 130 basis points from 97.4 percent in 2Q10 reflecting scale efficiencies associated with growth in the companys pharmacy solutions business together with the addition of the companys Concentra operations which carries a lower operating cost ratio than other lines of business in this segment.
Balance Sheet
At June 30, 2011, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $10.77 billion compared to $10.75 billion at March 31, 2011.
Parent company cash and investments of $990.4 million at June 30, 2011 increased $622.6 million from $367.8 million at March 31, 2011 primarily due to dividends to the parent company from the operating subsidiaries being partially offset by share repurchases during the second quarter.
Debt-to-total capitalization at June 30, 2011 was 18.0 percent, down 70 basis points compared to 18.7 percent at March 31, 2011 primarily driven by higher capitalization associated with second quarter earnings.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 2Q11 totaled $161.2 million compared to $325.3 million in 2Q10. Cash flows provided by operations for 1H11 totaled $956.7 million compared to $1.08 billion in 1H10. The decline in cash flows from operations for both periods reflected changes in working capital more than offsetting higher earnings year over year.
Share Repurchase Program and Cash Dividend
In April 2011, the companys Board of Directors replaced its previous share repurchase authorization with a new authorization for share repurchases of up to $1 billion. During 2Q11, the company repurchased 2,549,200 of its outstanding shares at an average price per share of $78.51. As of June 30, 2011, approximately $800 million of the April 2011 share repurchase authorization was remaining, with an expiration date of June 30, 2013.
In April 2011, the companys Board of Directors also initiated a quarterly cash dividend policy. An initial cash dividend payment of $41.5 million, or $0.25 per share, for stockholders of record as of June 30, 2011, was paid on July 28, 2011.
Footnotes
(a) During 2Q10, the company recognized an impairment of deferred acquisition cost (DAC) assets associated with its Individual Major Medical line of business of $147.5 million. The related DAC included amounts associated with commissions, underwriting and other policy issuance costs. Given then impending changes to this business associated with health insurance reform, a substantial portion of the DAC was determined to be not recoverable from future income.
(b) Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. When the Company recognizes a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business.
(c) The Company has included certain financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in its summary of financial results within this earnings press release. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the company's ongoing business and operating performance. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
(d) The company provides a full range of insured specialty products including dental, vision and other supplemental products. Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products. Other supplemental benefits include life, disability, and fixed benefit products including cancer and critical illness policies.

Cautionary Statement
This news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humanas executive officers, the words or phrases like expects, anticipates, intends, likely will result, estimates, projects or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the Risk Factors section of the companys SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following:
Health insurance reform legislation, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humanas results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, increasing the company's medical and administrative costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio, lowering the companys Medicare payment rates and increasing the companys expenses associated with a non-deductible federal premium tax; financial position, including the company's ability to maintain the value of its goodwill; and cash flows. In addition, if the new non-deductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted, and if Humana is unable to adjust its business model to address this new tax, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana charges are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to its members, or if its estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate, Humanas profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is extremely sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends.
If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, including its Medicare initiatives, the companys business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of the companys revenues in the Medicare business.
If Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect Humanas proprietary rights to its systems, the companys business may be materially adversely affected.
Humana is involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations, including without limitation, an ongoing internal investigation related to certain aspects of its Florida subsidiary operations, the outcome of any of which could result in substantial monetary damages, penalties, fines or other sanctions. Increased litigation or regulatory action and any related negative publicity could increase the companys cost of doing business.
Humanas business activities are subject to substantial government regulation and related audits for compliance, including, among others, existing audits regarding Medicare risk adjustment data. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application, including the methodology that may be used by the government in implementing results of risk adjustment audits, could increase the companys cost of doing business and may adversely affect the companys business, profitability and financial condition. In addition, as a government contractor, Humana is exposed to additional risks that may adversely affect the companys business or the companys willingness to participate in government health care programs.
On February 25, 2011, the Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA, awarded the TRICARE South Region contract to Humana. On March 7, 2011, the competing bidder filed a protest of the award with the Government Accountability Office. Also on March 7, 2011, as provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, TMA issued a stop work order to Humana in connection with the award. On June 14, 2011, the GAO upheld the award of the contract to Humana and TMA subsequently lifted the stop work order. On June 21, 2011, the competing bidder filed a complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims objecting to the award of the contract to Humana. That case is currently pending before the Court. As a result of the award of the TRICARE South Region contract to the company, Humana no longer expects a goodwill impairment to occur during the second half of 2011. Ultimate disposition of the contract award is, however, subject to the resolution of the complaint filed by the unsuccessful bidder
.
Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper Humanas profitability.
Any failure by Humana to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the companys business may be adversely affected.
Humanas home-delivery pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses.
Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humanas financial performance.
If Humana does not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, Humanas gross margins may decline.
Humanas ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.
Downgrades in Humanas debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Federal government contracts account for a substantial portion of Humanas revenue and earnings. A delay by Congress in raising the federal governments debt ceiling, should it occur, could lead to a reduction, suspension or cancellation of federal government spending that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on Humana's business and profitability.
Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect Humanas business and results of operations.
The securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect Humanas business.
Given the current economic climate, Humanas stock and the stock of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.
In making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Humana advises investors to read the following documents as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance:
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010;
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011;
Form 8-Ks filed during 2011.
