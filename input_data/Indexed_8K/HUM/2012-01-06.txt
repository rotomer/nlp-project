Item 7.01   Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
 
As previously disclosed, officers of Humana Inc. (the Company) will be meeting with investors and analysts at an industry conference on January 10, 2012. During the meetings, the Company intends to address its prospects and performance.
 
 
The Company expects gross individual sales for Medicare Advantage for 2012 to be somewhat higher than expected, with net growth somewhat higher than the Companys previous expectation for individual Medicare Advantage membership growth of 145,000 to 155,000.  Gross sales for stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans for 2012 are anticipated to be in the range of previous expectations, with net growth for 2012 in the Companys stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans also in the range of the Companys previous expectation of 500,000 to 600,000.
 
 
The Company is continuing to receive January 2012 disenrollment data for all Medicare plans from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), consistent with typical disenrollment reporting patterns from CMS.  Initial data indicates attrition in the Companys Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans is generally consistent with the Companys previous expectations.
 
 
The Company will not opine on earnings per share (EPS) expectations for 2011 and 2012 at this conference since it is in the process of closing its books for 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
