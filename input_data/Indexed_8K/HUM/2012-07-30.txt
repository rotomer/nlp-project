Exhibit 99
Humana Reports Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results
2Q12 EPS of $2.16 included $0.18 in expenses associated with litigation settlement
Full-year EPS now anticipated to be $6.90 to $7.10, down from previous estimate of $7.38 to $7.58
Company to host conference call at 5:00 p.m. today
LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 30, 2012--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 (2Q12) of $2.16, compared to $2.71 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 (2Q11). For the six months ended June 30, 2012 (1H12) the company reported $3.65 in EPS compared to $4.57 for the six months ended June 30, 2011 (1H11).
Results for 2Q12 and 1H12 included $0.18 per share in expenses related to the previously-disclosed settlement of a litigation matter. Prior-year favorable medical claims reserve development for 2Q12 of $0.15 per share compared to $0.12 per share in 2Q11. Results for 1H12 and 1H11 included $0.18 per share and $0.44 per share, respectively, of prior-year favorable medical claims reserve development.
The company lowered EPS guidance for the year ending December 31, 2012 (FY12) to a range of $6.90 to $7.10 versus its previous estimate of $7.38 to $7.58. This reduction in FY12 EPS guidance primarily reflects higher-than-previously expected individual Medicare Advantage benefit ratios associated with new members and increased utilization for both new and existing members.
"Our companys strategy is sound, though we are disappointed by the need to lower our full-year earnings guidance," said Michael B. McCallister, Humanas Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. We believe the steps we are taking to address certain short-term operational challenges will put us back on the path for sustainable earnings growth moving forward."
Consolidated Highlights
 2Q12 consolidated revenues were $9.70 billion, an increase of $415 million, or 4 percent from $9.28 billion in 2Q11, with total premiums and services revenue of $9.60 billion up $407 million, or 4 percent compared to $9.19 billion in the prior years quarter. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to related increases in the Retail and Employer Group segments driven by increases in average membership of the companys individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. These increases were partially offset by the companys new South Region TRICARE contract being accounted for as self-funded versus fully-insured for the previous contract. This new contract became effective on April 1, 2012.
Revenues
1H12 consolidated revenues rose $1.44 billion, or 8 percent to $19.92 billion from $18.48 billion in 1H11 with total premiums and services revenue of $19.73 billion also up 8 percent, increasing $1.43 billion compared to $18.30 billion in the prior years period, driven primarily by the same factors as the second quarter year-over-year increase.
 The 2Q12 consolidated benefit ratio (benefit expenses as a percent of premiums) of 83.5 percent increased 140 basis points from 82.1 percent for the prior years quarter due primarily to higher year-over-year benefit ratios for the Retail and Employer Group segments. The consolidated benefit ratio for 1H12 of 84.5 percent increased by 150 basis points from the 1H11 consolidated benefit ratio of 83.0 percent primarily due to the same factors impacting the 2Q12 year-over-year comparison.
Benefit expenses
 The consolidated operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percent of total revenues less investment income) of 14.4 percent increased 140 basis points for 2Q12 compared to 13.0 percent in 2Q11. The increased year-over-year ratio primarily reflects the impact of the accounting for the companys new South Region TRICARE contract discussed above.
Operating costs
The 1H12 consolidated operating cost ratio of 14.0 percent increased 60 basis points from 13.4 percent for 1H11 primarily due to the same factor impacting the second quarter year-over-year comparison.
Retail Segment Highlights
Pretax results:
Retail Segment pretax income of $367 million in 2Q12 decreased $136 million from $503 million in 2Q11. For 1H12, pretax earnings for the Retail Segment of $482 million decreased by $238 million versus 1H11 pretax earnings for the segment of $720 million. These decreases were primarily driven by year-over-year increases in both the segments benefit ratio and its operating cost ratio during 2Q12 and 1H12.
Enrollment:
Individual Medicare Advantage membership was 1,895,800 at June 30, 2012, an increase of 293,300 members, or 18 percent, from 1,602,500 at June 30, 2011. Individual Medicare Advantage membership has increased 255,500 or 16 percent from 1,640,300 at December 31, 2011.
The company acquired 12,100 members with the acquisition of MD Care effective December 30, 2011 and 62,600 members from the acquisition of Arcadian Management Services, Inc. (Arcadian) effective March 31, 2012. As previously announced, the company expects to divest approximately 12,600 members acquired with Arcadian effective January 1, 2013 in accordance with the companys previously disclosed agreement with the United States Department of Justice.
Membership in the companys individual stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) of 2,896,800 at June 30, 2012 was up 488,100, or 20 percent compared to 2,408,700 at June 30, 2011 and up 356,400, or 14 percent, from 2,540,400 at December 31, 2011. These increases resulted primarily from growth in the companys Humana-Walmart plan offering.
One medical membership increased to 443,800 at June 30, 2012, an increase of 40,100 or 10 percent, from 403,700 at June 30, 2011 and an increase of 10,200, or 2 percent, from 433,600 at December 31, 2011.
Humana
Membership in individual specialty products of 906,200 at June 30, 2012 increased 225,700, or 33 percent, from 680,500 at June 30, 2011 and increased 123,700, or 16 percent from 782,500 at December 31, 2011. Both the sequential and year-over-year increases were primarily driven by increased sales in dental offerings.
(a)
Premiums and services revenue:
2Q12 premiums and services revenue for the Retail Segment totaled $6.28 billion, an increase of $882 million, or 16 percent from $5.40 billion in 2Q11. The increase was primarily the result of year-over-year membership growth for individual Medicare Advantage plans.
Benefit expenses:
The 2Q12 benefit ratio for the Retail Segment was 84.1 percent, an increase of 270 basis points from 81.4 percent in 2Q11. The increase was primarily driven by the planned increase associated with positioning for Health Care Reform funding changes and minimum medical loss ratio requirements, a higher-than-previously expected Medicare Advantage benefit ratio associated with new members and increased utilization for both new and existing members as well as a year-over-year increase in clinicians and other health care quality expenditures given the continued growth in membership.
Retail Segment prior-year favorable medical claims reserve development for 2Q12 of $24 million compared to $32 million in 2Q11 lowered the related benefit ratio by 40 basis points in 2Q12 and 60 basis points in 2Q11.
Operating costs:
The Retail Segments operating cost ratio of 10.0 percent in 2Q12 increased 90 basis points from 9.1 percent in 2Q11 reflecting higher year-over-year clinical, provider and technological infrastructure spending.
Employer Group Segment Highlights
Pretax results:
Employer Group Segment pretax income of $114 million in 2Q12 increased $6 million compared to $108 million in 2Q11 as the benefit of a lower operating cost ratio during 2Q12 more than offset the year-over-year impact of a higher benefit ratio. For 1H12, pretax earnings for the Employer Group Segment of $235 million decreased by $12 million versus 1H11 pretax earnings for the segment of $247 million primarily reflecting a year-over-year increase in this segments benefit ratio partially offset by a lower operating cost ratio compared to 1H11.
Enrollment:
Group Medicare Advantage membership was 388,400 at June 30, 2012, an increase of 78,700 members, or 25 percent, from 309,700 at June 30, 2011, and an increase of 70,200, or 22 percent, from 318,200 at December 31, 2011. These increases primarily reflect the addition of a large group retiree account that became effective January 1, 2012.
Group fully-insured commercial medical membership of 1,196,900 at June 30, 2012, increased 10,700, or 1 percent from 1,186,200 at June 30, 2011 and 16,700, or 1 percent from 1,180,200 at December 31, 2011. Second quarter year-over-year and year-to-date changes primarily reflected growth in small group membership being partially offset by declines in large group business.
Group ASO commercial medical membership declined to 1,228,800 at June 30, 2012, a decrease of 84,800, or 6 percent, from 1,313,600 at June 30, 2011 and a decrease of 63,500, or 5 percent, from 1,292,300 at December 31, 2011. These declines reflected a continuation of pricing discipline in a highly competitive environment for self-funded accounts.
Membership in Employer Group specialty products of 6,957,800 at June 30, 2012 increased 288,200, or 4 percent, from 6,669,600 at June 30, 2011 and increased 425,200, or 7 percent from 6,532,600 at December 31, 2011 primarily due to increased cross-sales of such products and growth in stand-alone specialty product sales.
(a)
Premiums and services revenue:
2Q12 premiums and services revenue for the Employer Group Segment totaled $2.62 billion, an increase of $309 million, or 13 percent from $2.31 billion in 2Q11 due primarily to the result of increased group Medicare Advantage membership year over year.
Benefit expenses:
The 2Q12 benefit ratio for the Employer Group Segment was 82.2 percent, an increase of 100 basis points from 81.2 percent in 2Q11 primarily due to higher average group Medicare membership year over year. Group Medicare benefit ratios generally carry a higher benefit ratio than commercial group medical products.
Employer Group Segment prior-year favorable medical claims reserve development for 2Q12 of $12 million compared to unfavorable development of $8 million in 2Q11. As a result, this segments benefit ratio was lowered by 50 basis points in 2Q12 and increased by 40 basis points in 2Q11.
Operating costs:
The Employer Group Segments operating cost ratio of 15.9 percent in 2Q12 decreased 90 basis points from 16.8 percent in 2Q11 reflecting increased year-over-year membership in the companys group Medicare Advantage products which generally carry a lower operating cost ratio than the companys fully-insured commercial group products, as well as savings associated with operating cost reduction initiatives.
Health and Well-Being Services Segment Highlights
Pretax results:
Health and Well-Being Services Segment pretax income of $131 million in 2Q12 rose $43 million compared to $88 million in 2Q11 reflecting growth in the companys pharmacy solutions business, including higher utilization of the companys SourceRx mail-order pharmacy by the companys members. For 1H12, pretax earnings for the Health and Well-Being Services Segment of $263 million increased by $78 million versus 1H11 pretax earnings for the segment of $185 million.
Right
Script volume:
Script volumes for the Retail and Employer Group Segments membership increased to approximately 59 million in 2Q12, up 8 million, or 15 percent, versus 2Q11 scripts of approximately 51 million. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects growth associated with higher average medical membership for 2Q12 than in 2Q11.
Services revenue:
Services revenue of $3.22 billion in 2Q12 for the Health and Well-Being Services Segment increased $484 million, or 18 percent from $2.73 billion in 2Q11. This increase was primarily driven by growth in the companys Medicare Advantage membership, who use the companys pharmacy benefit management services under its health plan offerings, as well as increased utilization of SourceRx mail-order pharmacy by the companys membership across all product lines.
Right
Operating costs:
The Health and Well-Being Services Segments operating cost ratio of 95.2 percent in 2Q12 decreased 80 basis points from 96.0 percent in 2Q11 reflecting better administrative cost leverage and improved wholesale drug costs associated with higher script volumes in the companys SourceRx mail-order pharmacy
Right

Other Businesses Highlights
On April 1, 2012, the companys new South Region TRICARE contract became effective with the Department of Defense (DoD). The companys new contract is structured similar to self-funded products versus a fully-insured structure for the companys previous South Region TRICARE contract with the DoD. This change resulted in significant volatility in year-over-year comparisons for the companys Other Businesses.
During 2Q12, the company incurred benefit expenses of approximately $46 million, or $0.18 per share, related to the resolution of certain previously-disclosed litigation involving Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc.
Balance Sheet
At June 30, 2012, the companys cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $13.53 billion, increased $285 million, or 2 percent from $13.25 billion at March 31, 2012.
Parent company cash and investments of $1.28 billion at June 30, 2012 increased $1.06 billion from $225 million at March 31, 2012, primarily reflecting dividends to the parent company from the operating subsidiaries. These dividends were partially offset by share repurchases and the payment of a cash dividend to stockholders during the second quarter.
Days in claims payable were 51.0 at June 30, 2012, up 0.9 days from 50.1 at March 31, 2012.
Debt-to-total capitalization at June 30, 2012 was 16.1 percent, down 30 basis points compared to 16.4 percent at March 31, 2012 primarily driven by higher capitalization associated with second quarter earnings.
Cash Flows from Operations
Cash flows provided by operations for 2Q12 totaled $706 million compared to cash flows provided by operations of $161 million in 2Q11. For the first half of 2012, cash flows provided by operations totaled $3.05 billion versus $957 million in cash flows from operations during the first half of 2011. The company also evaluates operating cash flows on a non-GAAP basis:
(b)
The year over year decrease in the non-GAAP cash flows from operations is due to the effect on cash flows of changes in working capital accounts.
(b)
Share Repurchase Program and Cash Dividend
During 2Q12, the company repurchased 1,579,000 of its outstanding shares at an average price per share of $79.94 in connection with a share repurchase authorization for up to $1 billion approved by the companys Board of Directors in April 2012. As of June 30, 2012, $874 million of the April 2012 share repurchase authorization was remaining, with an expiration date of June 30, 2014.
A cash dividend payment of approximately $42 million, or $0.26 per share, for stockholders of record as of June 29, 2012, was paid on July 27, 2012 as approved by the companys Board of Directors in accordance with its quarterly cash dividend policy.

Cautionary Statement
This news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humanas executive officers, the words or phrases like expects, anticipates, intends, likely will result, estimates, projects or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the Risk Factors section of the companys SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following:
If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana charges are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to its members, or if its estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate, Humanas profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is extremely sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends.
If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, including its Medicare initiatives, the companys business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of the companys revenues in the Medicare business.
If Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, to protect Humanas proprietary rights to its systems, or to defend against cyber-security attacks, the companys business may be materially adversely affected.
Humanas business may be materially adversely impacted by CMSs adoption of a new coding set for diagnoses.
Humana is involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations, including without limitation, an ongoing internal investigation and litigation and government requests for information related to certain aspects of its Florida subsidiary operations, any of which, if resolved unfavorably to the company, could result in substantial monetary damages. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase the companys cost of doing business.
As a government contractor, Humana is exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect its business or its willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs.
Recently enacted health insurance reform, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humanas results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting the companys ability to expand into new markets, increasing the company's medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products (and particularly how the ratio may apply to Medicare plans, including aggregation, credibility thresholds, and its possible application to prescription drug plans), lowering the companys Medicare payment rates and increasing the companys expenses associated with a non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments; financial position, including the company's ability to maintain the value of its goodwill; and cash flows. In addition, if the new non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments, including a three-year commercial reinsurance fee, were imposed as enacted, and if Humana is unable to adjust its business model to address these new taxes and assessments, such as through the reduction of the companys operating costs, there can be no assurance that the non-deductible federal premium tax and other assessments would not have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
Humanas business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase the companys cost of doing business and may adversely affect the companys business, profitability and cash flows.
Any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper Humanas profitability.
Any failure by Humana to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the companys business may be adversely affected.
Humanas pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses.
Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humanas financial performance.
If Humana does not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, Humanas gross margins may decline.
Humanas ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.
Downgrades in Humanas debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect Humanas business and results of operations.
The securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect Humanas business.
Given the current economic climate, Humanas stock and the stock of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.
In making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Humana advises investors to read the following documents as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance:
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011;
Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2012;
Form 8-Ks filed during 2012.
