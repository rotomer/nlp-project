"Rating Event" means (i) the rating of the 2022 Senior Notes is lowered by both Rating Agencies during the related Trigger Period and (ii) the 2022 Senior Notes are rated below an Investment Grade rating by both Rating Agencies on any day during such Trigger Period. If either Rating Agency is not providing a rating of the 2022 Senior Notes on any day during such Trigger Period for any reason, the rating of such Rating Agency shall be deemed to be below Investment Grade on such day and such Rating Agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the 2022 Senior Notes during the Trigger Period.

The Notes are one of an indefinite number of series of debt securities of the Company (the "Securities"), issued or issuable under and pursuant to a base indenture, dated as of August 5, 2003 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. and as successor to The Bank of New York) (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a fifth supplemental indenture, dated as of December 10, 2012 (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture"; the Base Indenture as supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture is herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (other than supplemental indentures creating a different series of notes) reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are to be authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and provisions of the Notes are those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and those set forth in this Note. This Note is one of a series designated on the face hereof initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $600,000,000. The Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the Holders, issue and sell additional Securities ranking equally with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects (except for their date of issue, issue price and, if applicable, the first payment of interest on the additional notes) so that such additional Securities shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes.
The terms of other series of Securities issued under the Base Indenture may vary with respect to interest rates or interest rate formulas, issue dates, maturity, redemption, repayment, currency of payment and otherwise as provided in the Base Indenture. The Base Indenture further provides that Securities of a single series may be issued at various times, with different maturity dates and may bear interest at different rates. All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture, with respect to the Company) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series then Outstanding may declare the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest thereon shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.

As provided in the Indenture, the Notes shall be subject to repurchase by the Company or a third party at the option of the Holders at a purchase price of 101% upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series issued under the Indenture to be affected thereby, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of such series; that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or interest thereon, if any, or any premium payable upon redemption thereof; or (ii) change the Place of Payment on any Security or the currency or currency unit in which any Security or the principal or interest thereon is payable; (iii) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof; (iv) reduce or alter the method of computation of any amount payable upon redemption, repayment or purchase of any Securities by the Company (or the time when such redemption, repayment or purchase may be made); or (v) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of that series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series, except a default in the payment of principal of or interest, if any, on any Security of that series or a default with respect to a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be amended without the consent of such Holder.

Such definitive Notes shall be registered in such name or names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee.

The Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the Holders, issue and sell additional Securities ranking equally with the Notes and otherwise identical in all respects (except for their date of issue, issue price and, if applicable, the first payment of interest on the additional notes) so that such additional Securities shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes.
The terms of other series of Securities issued under the Base Indenture may vary with respect to interest rates or interest rate formulas, issue dates, maturity, redemption, repayment, currency of payment and otherwise as provided in the Base Indenture. The Base Indenture further provides that Securities of a single series may be issued at various times, with different maturity dates and may bear interest at different rates. All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture, with respect to the Company) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series then Outstanding may declare the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of this series due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest thereon shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.

provided
however

As provided in the Indenture, the Notes shall be subject to repurchase by the Company or a third party at the option of the Holders at a purchase price of 101% upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event. Upon receipt of notice of a Change of Control Offer, Holders electing to have Notes repurchased pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall either (i) surrender this Note with the form of "Option of Holder to Elect Repurchase" attached hereto completed or (ii) transfer its Notes to the Paying Agent by book-entry transfer pursuant to the applicable procedures of the Paying Agent, in either case prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.

Such definitive Notes shall be registered in such name or names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We are acting as special counsel to Humana Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333- 180023) (the "Registration Statement"), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to the issuance of $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.150% Senior Notes due 2022 and $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2042 (collectively, the "Debt Securities") of the Company. The Debt Securities are being offered and sold by the Company in a public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated December 5, 2012 by and between the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"). With your permission, all assumptions and statements of reliance herein have been made without any independent investigation or verification on our part except to the extent otherwise expressly stated, and we express no opinion with respect to the subject matter or accuracy of such assumptions or items relied upon.
The Debt Securities have been issued pursuant to a senior debt indenture, dated as of August 5, 2003, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. and as successor to The Bank of New York), as trustee (the "Trustee") (as supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 10, 2012, the "Ten Year Indenture"; and as supplemented by the Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 10, 2012, the "Thirty Year Indenture"; the Ten Year Indenture and the Thirty Year Indenture are collectively referred to herein as the "Indentures").
In connection with this opinion, we have (i) investigated such questions of law, (ii) examined originals or certified, conformed, facsimile, electronic or reproduction copies of such agreements, instruments, documents and records of the Company, such certificates of public officials and such other documents and (iii) received such information from officers and representatives of the Company and others, in each case as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. We have examined, among other documents, the following:

LOUISVILLE, KY (December 10, 2012)  Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) announced today the completion of its public offerings of $600 million of its 3.150 percent Senior Notes, due December 1, 2022, at 99.610 percent of the principal amount (the "2022 Senior Notes"), and $400 million of its 4.625 percent Senior Notes, due December 1, 2042, at 99.937 percent of the principal amount (the "2042 Senior Notes"). Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. acted as the joint book-running managers for both the 2022 Senior Notes and the 2042 Senior Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes Offerings").
The Company expects that a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes Offerings will be used for its previously-announced acquisition of Metropolitan Health Networks, Inc. ("Metropolitan"), to retire Metropolitan's indebtedness (after applying Metropolitan's estimated cash on hand at the closing of the acquisition), and to pay related fees and expenses. The Company expects to use any remaining net proceeds from the offering not applied to the foregoing uses for general corporate purposes.
In the event that the Company does not complete its acquisition of Metropolitan on or prior to May 31, 2013 or if, prior to that date, the merger agreement with respect to the acquisition is terminated, the Company will be required to redeem all of the notes of both series at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption.
