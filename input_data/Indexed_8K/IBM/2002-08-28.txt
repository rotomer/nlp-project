Item 5. Other Events The company announced on June 4, 2002, the decision to sell its disk drive operations to Hitachi, Ltd. which under generally accepted accounting principles will be accounted for as a discontinued operation. The quarterly consolidated financial results for 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 were previously filed on Form 8-K on July 9, 2002 to conform with this accounting treatment. The company is publishing consolidated financial earnings results for 2001 through 1997 in order to facilitate an analysis by users of the company's financial statements under this format. The financial results reported as discontinued operations include the external original equipment manufacturer (OEM) hard disk drive business and charges related to hard disk drives used in the company's e-server and e-storage products that were recorded in the Technology segment. The discontinued operations results do not reflect hard disk drive shipments to IBM internal customers which are eliminated in the company's consolidated financial results. These results are included in Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K. In addition, the Computation of Ratio of Income from Continuing Operations to Fixed Charges is also presented for the years 2001 through 1997 in Exhibit 99.2 of this Form 8-K. Item 7.
