Date: November 13, 2002 By: /s/ Robert F. Woods ------------------------------- (Robert F. Woods) Vice President and Controller
Attachment I John Joyce's remarks included the following comments: "Now, as promised, 2003. The street's current average for revenue expectations sees us getting back to some growth next year. And in light of the current GDP estimates we think this is a reasonable objective. And based on that revenue growth and coupled with all that we discussed here today the street's average estimate for growth and earnings per share for 2003 is also reasonable. So we are going into 2003 based on all the things that you heard today in a very, very good position to gain share regardless of the opportunity. But, when this industry does turn around, we are going to be the one company that can do all of this."
ATTACHMENT II The Q&A session included the following comments: QUESTION: "Just want to follow up on a question that was asked about the pension issue. Some people were surprised recently when you filed to contribute shares into the pension fund to cover your liability. And given that IBM's been generally a purchaser of your own shares as opposed to an issuer, two things. One, can you tell us what's the message that you were trying to convey there? I mean, you haven't issued shares; you just have the option of doing it. And two, does this prevent you from doing your own share repurchase or any other things like acquisitions? And on my second question, why don't you address that first?" ANSWER FROM JOHN JOYCE: "First, the consideration to use stock was simply to give us flexibility. We decided that as I stated in our October meeting, that we would fund our pension plans and we were considering contributing $1.5 billion a year until the US plan is fully funded by 2005. That's what I said. You know, and I had different options. We have different options. One of those options is to use stock. And so that's what we thought. But it was simply for the flexibility. And we'll make that decision as we go through time. Now, the decision on the amount and timing, we still have...we have not decided yet. I'm telling you where we are at this point in time. And any decision is obviously dependent on many variables, and there are a number of alternatives on timing and on the amount. And so that's where we are today relative to the pension. Now, to your second point, $21 billion of free cash flow over the last couple of years. We think that we have a strong balance sheet and that we will be able to deal with any of these issues as we go forward."
