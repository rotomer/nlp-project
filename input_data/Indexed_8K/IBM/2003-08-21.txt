Ladies and Gentlemen:
        1.
    Introduction.
    International Business Machines Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Issuer"), confirms its agreement with each of you (individually an "Agent" and collectively the "Agents") with respect to the issue and sale from time to time by the Issuer on or after the date hereof of up to $20,000,000,000 in aggregate initial offering price of its Medium-Term Debt Securities (or for Medium-Term Debt Securities denominated in currencies or currency units other than U.S. dollars, the equivalent thereof based on the prevailing exchange rates at the respective times such Medium-Term Securities are first offered) (the "Securities") issued under Article Three of the Indenture dated as of October 1, 1993, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of December 15, 1995 (the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Securities will be issued, and the terms thereof established, from time to time by the Issuer in accordance with the Indenture and the Procedures (as defined in Section 3(d) hereof).
        2.
    Representations and Warranties of the Issuer.
    The Issuer represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Agent as follows:
        (a)   A Registration statement of the Issuer (No. 333-102603), relating to securities of the Issuer (collectively the "Registered Securities"), including the Securities, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and has become effective (such registration statement, as amended as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3(e) hereof), including all material incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the prospectus dated
February 4, 2003
, a form of which is included in Registration Statement No. 333-102603, as supplemented as of the Closing Date, including all material incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus"). Any reference in this Agreement to amending or supplementing the Prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of materials incorporated by reference in the Prospectus after the Closing Date and any reference in this Agreement to any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus shall be deemed to include any such materials incorporated by reference in the Prospectus after the Closing Date.
        (b)   On the effective date of the registration statement included in the definition of Registration Statement, such registration statement conformed, and on the Closing Date, the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented will conform, in all material respects to the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "Rules and Regulations"), and on its effective date the registration statement did not, and such Prospectus will not, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except that the foregoing does not apply to statements in or omissions from any of such documents based upon written information furnished to the Issuer by any Agent specifically for use therein.
        3.
    Appointment as Agent; Solicitations as Agent.
    
        (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, the Issuer hereby appoints each of the Agents an agent of the Issuer for the purpose of soliciting or receiving offers to purchase the Securities from the Issuer by others. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Issuer from selling at any time to any person any Registered Securities, including the Securities, directly on its own behalf or in a firm commitment underwriting pursuant to an underwriting agreement that does not provide for a continuous offering of such Securities. Each Agent agrees to use its reasonable efforts to solicit purchases of the Securities on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Procedures (as defined below).
        (b)   On the basis of the representations and warranties contained herein, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each Agent agrees, as agent of the Issuer, to solicit offers to purchase the Securities upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus, as from time to time amended or supplemented.
        Upon receipt of notice from the Issuer as contemplated by Section 4(b) hereof, the Agents shall suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities until such time as the Issuer shall have furnished them with an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, contemplated by Section 4(b) and shall have advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.
        The Issuer reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently. Upon receipt of notice from the Issuer, the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities from the Issuer until such time as the Issuer has advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed. During any such suspension, the Issuer's obligations under Sections 6(a), 6(b), 6(c) and 6(d) shall be suspended, except with respect to Notes held by an Agent for resale during the first 180 days after the Agent's purchase thereof and identified in a notice from the Agent to the Issuer as being held by such Agent for resale during such period.
        Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Issuer and the Agent soliciting such offer, the Agents are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Securities only in fully registered form in denominations of $100,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. The authorized denominations of Securities not denominated in U.S. dollars will be determined by the Issuer at the time of sale. Each Agent shall communicate to the Issuer, orally or in writing, each reasonable offer to purchase the Securities received by it as Agent. The Issuer shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Securities and may reject any such offer, in whole or in part. Each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, without notice to the Issuer, to reject any offer to purchase the Securities received by it, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreement contained herein.
        No Security which the Issuer has agreed to sell pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been purchased and paid for, or sold, by the Issuer until such Security shall have been delivered to the purchaser thereof against payment by such purchaser.
        (c) At the time of delivery of, and payment for, any Securities sold by the Issuer as a result of a solicitation made by, or offer to purchase received by, an Agent, the Issuer agrees to pay such Agent a commission in accordance with the schedule set forth in Exhibit A hereto, unless otherwise agreed.
        (d) Administrative procedures respecting the sale of Securities (the "Procedures") shall be agreed upon from time to time by the Agents and the Issuer. The initial Procedures, which are set forth in Exhibit B hereto, shall remain in effect until changed by agreement among the Issuer and the Agents. Each Agent and the Issuer agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each of them herein and in the Procedures. The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee a copy of the Procedures as from time to time in effect.
        (e) The documents required to be delivered by Section 5 hereof shall be delivered at the offices of the Issuer in Armonk, New York, or counsel for the Issuer in New York City, not later than 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the date of this Agreement or at such other place, and at such later time and date as may be mutually agreed by the Issuer and the Agents, such time and date being herein called the "Closing Date."
        4.     
Certain Agreements of the Issuer.    
The Issuer agrees with the Agents that, in connection with each offering of Securities,
        (a) The Issuer will advise each Agent promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (other than an amendment or supplement (i)  providing solely for a change in the terms of the Securities, (ii) by means of the filing of materials incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, (iii) relating to an offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities other than the Securities or (iv) that is a pricing amendment or supplement relating to Securities the purchase of which was not solicited by any Agent) and will afford the Agents a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement; and the Issuer will also advise each Agent of the filing of any such amendment or supplement and of the institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued.
        (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the Registration Statement or the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Rules and Regulations (other than as contemplated in the parenthetical clause of Section 4(a) hereof), the Issuer will promptly notify each Agent to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities; and if the Issuer shall decide so to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, it will promptly advise each Agent by telephone (with confirmation in writing) and will promptly prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at the time of any notification to suspend solicitations, any Agent shall own any of the Securities with the intention of reselling them as contemplated by Section 11 hereof, or the Issuer has accepted an offer to purchase Securities but the related settlement has not occurred, the Issuer, subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section, will promptly prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance.
        (c) The Issuer, during the period when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the Commission
pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Issuer will promptly furnish each Agent with copies of all material press releases or announcements to the general public which are not filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and are not otherwise available on the IBM home page on the Internet, at "http://www.ibm.com." The Issuer will also immediately notify each Agent of any downgrading in the rating of the Securities or any other debt securities of the Issuer, or any proposal to downgrade the rating of the Securities or any other debt securities of the Issuer, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act), as soon as the Issuer learns of such downgrading or proposal to downgrade.
        (d) The Issuer will furnish to each Agent copies of the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements thereto, and all amendments to the Registration Statement after the date hereof (other than an amendment or supplement (i) relating to an offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities other than the Securities or (ii) that solely specifies the terms of the Securities the purchase of which was not solicited by any Agent), in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as are reasonably requested.
        (e) The Issuer will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale and the termination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Agents designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities.
        (f) So long as any Securities are outstanding, if so requested by the Agents, the Issuer will furnish to the Agents, (i) as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to stockholders for such year, (ii) as soon as available, a copy of each report or definitive proxy statement of the Issuer, if any, filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act or mailed to stockholders, and (iii) from time to time, such other information concerning the Issuer as the Agents may reasonably request.
        (g) Unless otherwise agreed, the Issuer will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse each Agent for any expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by it in connection with qualification of the Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as such Agent may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, for expenses incurred in distributing the Prospectus and all supplements thereto, any preliminary prospectuses and any preliminary prospectus supplements, to each Agent and for the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agents.
        5.     
Conditions of Obligations.    
The obligation of each Agent, whether acting as agent of the Issuer or as principal under this Agreement, at any time to solicit offers to purchase the Securities is subject to the accuracy, on the date hereof, on the Closing Date, on the date of each such solicitation, and at each of the times of acceptance and of delivery referred to in Section 6(a) hereof and at each Representation Date (as defined in Section 6(b)), of the representations and warranties of the Issuer herein, to the accuracy, on each such date, of the statements of the Issuer's officers in any certificates made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance, on or prior to each such date, by the Issuer of its obligations hereunder, and to each of the following additional conditions precedent:
        (a) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Issuer or any Agent, shall be contemplated by the Commission.
        (b) The Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the Closing Date, the date of such solicitation or any Representation Date, shall not contain any untrue statement of fact which, in the opinion of any Agent, is material or omits to state a fact which, in the opinion of any Agent, is
material and is required to be stated therein or is necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
        (c) There shall not have occurred between each trade and settlement date (i) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Issuer or its subsidiaries which, in the judgment of such Agent, materially impairs the investment quality of the Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of the Issuer's debt securities or public announcement that such debt securities are under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act); (iii) any suspension or limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Issuer on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (iv) any banking moratorium declared by Federal or New York authorities; or (v) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of such Agent, the effect of any such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with solicitations of purchases of, or sales of, Securities.
        (d) At the Closing Date, the Agents shall have received:
        (i) the opinion of the General Counsel of the Issuer (or any Assistant General Counsel, Associate General Counsel, or other internal Counsel of or representing the Issuer having knowledge of and competence in securities or other financial matters; the "Issuer Counsel"), or, at the election of the Issuer, the opinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, outside counsel for the Issuer, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
        (A) the Issuer (x) has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, with full corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and (y) is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction within the United States which requires such qualification wherein it owns or leases material properties or conducts material business where such failure so to qualify may have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, earnings, business or properties of the Issuer;
        (B) to the knowledge of opining counsel, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit, which is not described or filed as required; and the statements in the Prospectus describing the terms of the Securities and the provisions of the Indenture fairly summarize the matters therein described; and
        (C) none of the issue and sale of the Securities, the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated herein or the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, (x) the charter or by-laws of the Issuer; (y) the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries is a party or bound, or (z) any order or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries.
        (D) the authorized Securities conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus;
        (E) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Securities have been duly authorized by resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Issuer for issuance for a period of time ending on the date when all Securities authorized under such resolutions have been issued (the "Period"), subject to the establishment of certain terms of the Securities by officers of the Issuer authorized by such resolutions to establish such terms, and, when the terms of any such Security have been established as provided in such resolutions and in the Indenture and such has been executed and authenticated during such period in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the purchaser thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, each such Security, assuming it does not violate any applicable law then binding on the Issuer, will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Issuer entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;
        (F) the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto have become effective under the Act, and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened;
        (G) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer; and
        (H) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any United States Federal or New York governmental agency or regulatory body is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the issue and sale of the Securities and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained.
        (ii) such opining counsel shall also furnish a letter, dated the Closing Date, that shall state that such counsel has no reason to believe that: (A) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof at the time it became effective contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case, except for the financial statements and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1), included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view); and (B) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (except the financial statements and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1), included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no view), were not appropriately
responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder.
        (e) At the Closing Date, the Agents shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President, and by the Treasurer, Controller, or Secretary or any Assistant Treasurer, Assistant Controller or Assistant Secretary of the Issuer in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that (i) the representations and warranties of the Issuer in this Agreement are true and correct, (ii) the Issuer has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are threatened by the Commission, and (iv) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the financial position or results of operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Prospectus or as described in such certificate.
        (f)    At the Closing Date, the Agents shall have received a letter, dated such date, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC"), and Ernst & Young, LLP, as applicable, confirming that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published Rules and Regulations thereunder, that the response, if any, to Item 10 of the Registration Statement is correct insofar as it relates to them and stating in effect that:
        (i)    in their opinion, the audited financial statements and schedules thereto included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the related published Rules and Regulations thereunder with respect to financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated in annual reports on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act;
        (ii)   on the basis of a reading of the unaudited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Issuer and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the Board of Directors of the Issuer and the Pricing Committee appointed by the Board of Directors of the Issuer,
if any
; and inquiries of certain officials of the Issuer who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
        (A)  any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; or said unaudited financial statements are not fairly presented (except as permitted by Form 10-Q) in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus; or
        (B)  any unaudited capsule information included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus does not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which it was derived or was not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus; and
        (iii)  they have performed certain other procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Issuer) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, including the information included or incorporated in Items 1 and 7 of the Issuer's Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated therein or in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated in any of the Issuer's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated therein, agrees with the accounting records of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
        References to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus in this subsection (f) are to such documents as amended and supplemented at the date of the letter.
        (g)   The Agents shall have received from Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Agents, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the validity of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as they may require, and the Issuer shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
        (h)   With respect to any Security denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, more than one currency or a composite currency or any Security the principal or interest of which is indexed to such currency, currencies or composite currency, there shall not have occurred a suspension or material limitation in foreign exchange trading in such currency, currencies or composite currency by a major international bank, a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in the country or countries issuing such currency, currencies or composite currency, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving, the occurrence of any material adverse change in the existing financial, political or economic conditions of, or the declaration of war or a national emergency by, the country or countries issuing such currency, currencies or composite currency or the imposition or proposal of exchange controls by any governmental authority in the country or countries issuing such currency, currencies or composite currency.
        The obligation of each Agent, as agent of the Issuer, under this Agreement to solicit offers to purchase Securities at any time after the end of the Period is also subject to the delivery to the Agents before that date and thereafter, periodically as appropriate, of an opinion from either Issuer Counsel or Cravath, Swaine & Moore, to the effect of subparagraph (d)(i)(E) above with respect to the Securities to be issued during the period set forth therein (which shall include the period of contemplated solicitation) and such other documents and certificates (including an opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell to the effect of subparagraph (g) above) as the Agents may reasonably request before that date and the Issuer shall have furnished to Davis Polk & Wardwell such documents as they may reasonably request before that date for the purpose of enabling them to render such opinion.
        The Issuer will furnish the Agents with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as they reasonably request.
        6.     
Additional Covenants of the Issuer.    
The Issuer agrees that:
        (a)   Each acceptance by the Issuer of an offer for the purchase of Securities (whether through an Agent as agent or to one or more Agents as principal) and each delivery of Securities (whether through an Agent as agent or to one or more Agents as principal) shall be deemed to be an affirmation that its representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and correct at the time of such acceptance and a covenant that such representations and warranties will be true and correct at the time of delivery to the purchaser of the Securities relating to such acceptance as though made at and as of each such time, it being understood that such representations and warranties shall relate to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at each such time. Each such acceptance by the Issuer of an offer for the purchase of Securities shall be deemed to constitute an additional representation, warranty and agreement by the Issuer that, as of the settlement date for the sale of such securities, after giving effect to the issuance of such Securities, of any other Securities to be issued on or prior to such settlement date and of any other Registered Securities to be issued and sold by the Issuer on or prior to such settlement date, the aggregate amount of Registered Securities (including any Securities) which have been issued and sold by the Issuer will not exceed the amount of Registered Securities registered pursuant to the Registration Statement.
        (b)   Each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by an amendment or supplement (i) that relates to an offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities other than the Securities or (ii) that solely specifies the terms of the
Securities) (each such time being herein referred to as a "Representation Date"), the Issuer shall, concurrently with such amendment or supplement, furnish the Agents with a certificate, dated the date of delivery thereof, of the President or any Vice President, and by the Treasurer, the Controller, the Secretary or any Assistant Treasurer, Assistant Controller or Assistant Secretary of the Issuer, in form satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate covering the matters set forth in Section 5(e) hereof which was last furnished to the Agents are true and correct at the time of such amendment or supplement as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such time and except that the statements contained in the certificate covering the matters set forth in clause (ii) of Section 5(e) shall be deemed to relate to the time of delivery of such certificate) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same tenor as the certificate referred to in Section 5(e), modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at the time of delivery of such certificate and, in the case of the matters set forth in clause (ii) of Section 5(e), to the time of delivery of such certificate; provided, however, that the Issuer shall deliver such certificate with respect to a Representation Date arising from the incorporation by reference into the Prospectus of a current report on Form 8-K or a quarterly report on Form 10-Q only upon the reasonable request of the Agents.
        (c)   At each Representation Date, the Issuer shall, if reasonably requested by the Agents, concurrently furnish the Agents with a written opinion or opinions, dated the date of such Representation Date, of Issuer Counsel or Cravath, Swaine & Moore, in form satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect set forth in Section 5(d) hereof, but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such Representation Date; provided, however, that in lieu of such opinion or opinions, counsel may furnish the Agents with a letter or letters to the effect that the Agents may rely on a prior opinion delivered under Section 5(d) or this Section 6(c) to the same extent as if it were dated the date of such letter (except that statements in such prior opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such Representation Date).
        (d)   At each Representation Date on which the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented to include additional financial information as a result of filing of the Issuer's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and upon the reasonable request of the Agents, the Issuer shall cause PWC, and Ernst & Young, LLP, as applicable, concurrently to furnish the Agents with a letter, addressed jointly to the Issuer and the Agents and dated the date of such Representation Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect set forth in Section 5(f) hereof but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such Representation Date, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Issuer; provided, however, that if the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented solely to include financial information as of and for a fiscal quarter, PWC, and Ernst & Young, LLP, as applicable, may limit the scope of such letter to the audited financial statements included in such amendment or supplement unless there is contained therein any other accounting, financial or statistical information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Agents, should be covered by such letter, in which event such letter shall also cover such other information and procedures as shall be agreed upon by the Agents.
        (e)   The Issuer agrees that any obligation of a person who has agreed to purchase Securities as the result of solicitation by any Agent pursuant hereto to make payment for and take delivery of such Securities shall be subject to (i) the accuracy, on the related settlement date fixed pursuant to the Procedures, of the Issuer's representation and warranty deemed to be made to the Agents pursuant to the last sentence of subsection (a) of this Section 6, and (ii) the satisfaction, on such settlement date, of each of the conditions set forth in Sections 5(a), (b) and (c), it being understood that under no circumstance shall any Agent have any duty or obligation to exercise the judgment permitted under Section 5(b) or (c) on behalf of any such person.
        (f)    The Issuer agrees to make generally available to its security holders "earning statements" satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 158 thereunder, which requirement is deemed satisfied under such Rule through the Issuer's timely filing of periodic reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934.
        7.     
Indemnification and Contribution.
        (a)   The Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each person who controls such Agent within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or State statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement relating to the Registered Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereto, or in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Issuer will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer by any Agent specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof and (ii) such indemnity with respect to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Agent (or any person controlling such Agent) through which the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented), excluding documents incorporated therein by reference, at or prior to the earlier of the confirmation of the sale of such Securities or the delivery of the Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Issuer may otherwise have.
        (b)   Each Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, and each person who controls the Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuer to such Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to such Agent furnished to the Issuer by such Agent specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Agent may otherwise have.
        (c)   Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel, approved by the Agents in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
        (d)   In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 7 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Issuer on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Issuer and each Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Issuer and such Agents may be subject in such proportion so that each Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the sum of aggregate commissions received by such Agent pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof in connection with the sale of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability relates bears to the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, and the Issuer is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any Agent be responsible for any amount in excess of the commissions received by it for such Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability relates, and (z) no person found liable for fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was found not liable for such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls any Agent within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each person who controls the Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Issuer who shall have signed the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, and each director of the Issuer shall have the same rights to contribution as the Issuer, subject in each case to clause (y) of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to
contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
        8.     
Status of each Agent.    
In soliciting offers to purchase the Securities from the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement and in assuming its other obligations hereunder (other than offers to purchase pursuant to Section 11 hereof), each Agent is acting solely as agent for the Issuer and not as principal. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Issuer in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Issuer has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Issuer, but such Agent shall have no liability to the Issuer in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Issuer shall default on its obligations to deliver Securities to a purchaser who has agreed to purchase Securities as a result of solicitation by any Agent pursuant hereto, and whose offer the Issuer has accepted, the Issuer (i) shall hold the Agents harmless against any loss, claim or damages arising from or as a result of such default by the Issuer, and (ii) in particular, shall pay to the Agents any commission to which they would be entitled in connection with such sale.
        9.     
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.    
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Issuer or its officers and of the Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Agent, the Issuer or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 or for any other reason, the Issuer shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4(g) and the obligations of the Issuer under Section 4(f) and Section 6(f) and the respective obligations of the Issuer and the Agents pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect. In addition, if any such termination shall occur either (i) at a time when any Agent shall own any of the Securities with the intention of reselling them as contemplated by Section 11 hereof or (ii) after the Issuer has accepted an offer to purchase Securities solicited by any Agent pursuant hereto and prior to the related settlement, the obligations of the Issuer under the last sentence of Section 4(b), under Sections 4(a), 4(c), 4(d), 4(e) and Section 6 and, in the case of a termination occurring as described in (ii) above, under Section 3(c) and under the last sentence of Section 8, shall also remain in effect.
        10.   
Termination.    
This Agreement may be terminated for any reason at any time by the Issuer as to any Agent or, in the case of any Agent, by such Agent insofar as this Agreement relates to such Agent, upon the giving of one day's written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto. Any settlement with respect to Securities placed by an Agent occurring after termination of this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the Procedures and each Agent agrees, if requested by the Issuer, to take the steps therein provided to be taken by such Agent in connection with such settlement.
        11.   
Purchases as Principal.    
From time to time, any Agent may agree with the Issuer to purchase Securities from the Issuer as principal. In such case the purchasing Agent and the Issuer may, in their discretion, set forth the terms of such purchase in a separate agreement (a "Purchase Agreement") to be entered into between such Agent and the Issuer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. Upon acceptance by the Issuer of an offer to purchase Securities, unless the Issuer and the purchasing Agent otherwise agree in writing, any such Purchase Agreement or other written confirmation or communication transmitted by the purchasing Agent to the Issuer or, in the absence of a Purchase Agreement or other written confirmation or communication from the purchasing Agent, the oral agreement with respect to the terms of the Securities and of their offer and sale evidenced by the offer
communicated by the purchasing Agent and accepted by the Issuer, in each case together with the provisions of this Agreement, shall constitute an agreement between the purchasing Agent and the Issuer for the sale and purchase of such Securities (whether or not any Purchase Agreement or other written confirmation or communication shall have been executed by the Issuer or the purchasing Agent). In connection with any resale of Securities so purchased, such Securities may be resold by such Agent at varying prices from time to time or at a fixed public offering price or that such Agent may use a selling or dealer group. Such Agent may reallow to any broker or dealer any portion of the discount or commission payable pursuant hereto. A Purchase Agreement, to the extent set forth therein, may incorporate by reference specified provisions of this Agreement.

CONFIRMED AND ACCEPTED, as of the date first above written:

EXHIBIT B
Administrative Procedures
        The Medium-Term Notes Due One Year or More from Date of Issue (the "Notes") are to be offered on a continuing basis by International Business Machines Corporation (the "Issuer"). ABN AMRO Incorporated, Banc of America Securities LLC, Banc One Capital Markets, Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BNY Capital Markets, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J. P. Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and UBS Securities LLC, as agents (each individually an "Agent" and collectively the "Agents"), have agreed to use reasonable efforts to solicit purchases of the Notes pursuant to an Agency Agreement dated as of
August 21, 2003
(the "Agency Agreement"), among the Issuer and the Agents. No Agent will be obligated to purchase Notes for its own account. The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of October 1, 1993 between the Issuer and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of December 1, 1995 (collectively, the "Indenture"). The Notes will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission").
        Each Note will be represented initially by a global security in the form of a Master Note registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, as Depositary ("DTC") (a "Book-Entry Note") or a certificate issued in definitive form (a "Certificate Note"). It is currently contemplated that both Fixed Rate Notes (as defined below) and Floating Rate Notes (as defined below) may be issued as Book-Entry Notes. The Master Note representing the Book-Entry Notes will be issued only in fully registered form without coupons. The Master Note will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, on the securities register maintained under the Indenture.
        Administrative procedures and specific terms of the Notes and the offering, to the extent Notes are offered and sold through the Agents, are explained below. Administrative and record-keeping responsibilities will be handled for the Issuer by competent personnel assigned to such tasks in its Treasury Department. The Issuer will advise each Agent in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities with whom each Agent is to communicate regarding offers to purchase Notes and the details of their delivery. To the extent that the following procedures conflict with the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture or the Letter (as defined below), the relevant provisions of the Note, the Indenture or the Letter shall control.
I.    CERTIFICATE NOTES AND GENERAL TERMS
        Unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer and the relevant agent, the following administrative procedures and specific terms are applicable to Certificate Notes and, except to the extent otherwise specified under II below, Book-Entry Notes, which Book-Entry Notes shall, unless otherwise required by DTC, be understood to include all Notes issued under the Medium-Term Master Note. As set forth under item II, infra, the Medium-Term Master Note representing the Book-Entry Notes will be issued only in fully registered form without coupons. The Medium-Term Master Note will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, on the securities register maintained under the Indenture.
II.    BOOK-ENTRY NOTES
        The following procedures supplement and, to the extent inconsistent therewith, replace the procedures set forth above with respect to the offering of Book-Entry Notes. In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Notes for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of Representation (the "Letter") from the Issuer and the Trustee to be entered into with DTC and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the Trustee and DTC dated as of December 2, 1988, and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS"). Both Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes may be issued in book-entry form. Unless otherwise required by DTC, each Book-Entry Note shall be issued under the Medium-Term Master Note dated as of
August 21, 2003
(the "Master Note"). The Master Note representing the Book-Entry Notes will be issued only in fully registered form without coupons. The Master Note will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, on the securities register maintained under the Indenture.

        PURCHASE AGREEMENT
, 200            
International Business Machines Corporation Office of the Treasurer New Orchard Road Armonk, NY 10504
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        The undersigned agrees to purchase the following principal amount of the Securities described in the Agency Agreement dated
August 21, 2003
(the "Agency Agreement"):
        Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms used herein which are defined in the Agency Agreement shall have the same meanings as in the Agency Agreement. The terms Agent or Agents, as used in the Agency Agreement, shall be deemed to refer to the undersigned for purposes of this Agreement.
        This Agreement incorporates by reference Sections 3(c), 4, 6, 7, 12 and 13 of the Agency Agreement, the first and last sentences of Section 9 thereof and, to the extent applicable, the Procedures. You and we agree to perform, to the extent applicable, our respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each of us in the Procedures.
        Our obligation to purchase Securities hereunder is subject to the accuracy on the above Settlement Date of your representations and warranties contained in Section 2 of the Agency Agreement (it being understood that such representations and warranties shall relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended at such Settlement Date) and to your performance and observance of all covenants and agreements contained in Sections 4 and 6 thereof. Our obligation hereunder is also subject to the following conditions:
        (a)  the satisfaction, at such Settlement Date, of each of the conditions set forth in subsections (a) and (b) and (d) through (g) of Section 5 of the Agency Agreement (it being understood that each document so required to be delivered shall be dated such Settlement Date and that each such condition and the statements contained in each such document that relate to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, as amended or supplemented at the time of settlement on such Settlement Date and except that the opinion described in Section 5(d) of the Agency Agreement shall be modified so as to state that the Securities being sold on such Settlement Date, when delivered against payment therefor as provided in the Indenture and this Agreement, will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Issuer enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject only to the exceptions as to enforcement set forth in clause (ii)
of Section 5(d) of the Agency Agreement, and will conform to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such Settlement Date); and
        (b)  there shall not have occurred (i) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Issuer or its subsidiaries which, in our judgment, materially impairs the investment quality of the Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of the Issuer's debt securities or public announcement that such debt securities are under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act); (iii) any suspension or limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Issuer on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (iv) any banking moratorium declared by Federal or New York State authorities; or (v) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity, emergency or pestilence if, in our reasonable judgment, the effect of any such substantial national or international outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity, emergency or pestilence makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the sale of and payment for the Securities.
        [Optional, for select MTN issuances]
        [In further consideration of our agreement hereunder, you agree that between the date hereof and the above Settlement Date, you will not offer or sell, or enter into any agreement to sell, any Debt Securities of the Issuer, other than sales of securities outside the United States, borrowings under your revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, so-called private placement of securities and issuances of your commercial paper, whether pursuant to Section 3(a)(3), 4(2) Regulation S or otherwise.]
        If for any reason our purchase of the above Securities is not consummated, you shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by you pursuant to Section 4 of the Agency Agreement and the respective obligations of you and the undersigned pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect. If for any reason our purchase of the above Securities is not consummated other than because of our default or a failure to satisfy a condition set forth in clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of paragraph (b) above, you shall reimburse us, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with the offering of the above Securities and not otherwise required to be reimbursed pursuant to Section 4 of the Agency Agreement.
        This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and the executed counterparts shall together constitute a single instrument.
