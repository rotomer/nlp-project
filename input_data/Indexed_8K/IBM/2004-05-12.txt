 - 
                 
Thanks for joining
 - 
                 
I'll provide business update; Bernie Meyerson will provide technology update
 - 
                 
Formed STG earlier this year
 - 
                 
We're a systems business with incredible chip making capabilities
 - 
                 
Top priority is to provide leadership technology for IBM servers
 - 
                 
Extremely committed to OEM business:  2/3 external  1/3 internal
 - 
                 
Four major segments:  Power Architecture, ASICs, value added foundry and E&TS
 - 
                 
 
Performance improvements will be based more on integration and less on lithography
 - 
                 
Common objectives and incentives
 - 
                 
No coincidence that our upswing was around the time of POWER4 launch
 - 
                 
Now we've had 13 consecutive quarters of server share growth
 - 
                 
Also produced Summit chip set and T-rex
 - 
                 
Begin shipping POWER5 in iSeries this quarter

Delivering our third generation of dual-core while others consider their first
 - 
                 
More than a quarter billion transistors on a die smaller than 400 square millimeters
 - 
                 
Our value proposition same for OEMs as it is for IBM
 - 
                 
Provide a combination of assets:  IP, design skills, ASICs, Power Architecture, foundry
 - 
                 
We're able to integrate these offerings
 - 
                 
These technology leaders have chosen to join with IBM at our 300 mm development center in East Fishkill
 - 
                 
Two groups:
 - 
                 
AMD, Sony and Toshiba on SOI
Chartered, Infineon and Samsung on bulk silicon
Creating a global technology platform
 - 
                 
Overseas companies have invested more than half a billion dollars and created more than 150 jobs in our NY facility
 - 
                 
Leverage with suppliers and tool makers
 - 
                 
From development, we move into manufacturing
 - 
                 
Our fabs are designed to be flexible
 - 
                 
300 mm designed from 130 nm to 65 nm
 -

 - 
                 
We'll use our partners to supplement our capacity
 - 
                 
 
Slide 8
 
Much has been written on our yields recently.  I want to take a minute to let you know where things stand.
 
As our CFO, John Joyce, said when we reported our first quarter earnings, our 200 mm yields are at or above plan while our
300 mm yields, while improving, are not yet where we want them to be.
 
The next chart illustrates those comments.  As you can see, our 130 nm, 300 mm defect densities  the number of defects in a given section of silicon  are showing rapid improvement.  As you can see, we are getting much closer to where we want to be.
 
It's important to point out here that we are working on extremely complex logic.  At a given lithography node we can provide up to 20 percent higher speeds than our competition, though in some cases these advanced chips are more difficult to yield.   And while the traditional foundries currently have less than 20 percent of their volumes in 130 nm or smaller, about 50 percent of our volumes are 130 nm or below.
 
As John Joyce suggested, we expect to do a better job of meeting customer demand in second quarter
We are totally and deeply committed to Power Architecture
