Earlier this morning, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and IBM announced JPMorgan Chase's plans to reintegrate much of the previously outsourced portions of its technology infrastructure, including data centers, help desks, distributed computing, data networks and voice networks, effective January 1, 2005. Since this contract was still in the early stages of deployment, IBM was continuing to invest in the engagement. On a year-to-year basis for 2005, IBM anticipates that the cancellation of this contract will have a positive impact to IBM earnings per share  with no impact on our full-year model. IBM's backlog of IT services will be revised accordingly as part of our third quarter earnings announcement.
