SOFTWARE ACQUISITIONS
FORTIFYING IBM'S MIDDLEWARE PLATFORM
MARCH 24, 2005
 
IBM's software strategy is to provide a market-leading middleware platform with ubiquitous appeal to developers, I/T professionals and business managers alike. Innovation of the IBM software labs, leveraging decades of industry expertise, will continue to be the corner-stone of IBM's success in middleware.
 
Over the last four years, IBM has accelerated its acquisition of software firms  ranging from multibillion-dollar deals such as , to smaller, targeted acquisitions of emerging or complementary technologies. Just last week we announced an agreement to buy Ascential Software for $1.1 billion.
Informix and Rational
 
"IBM's superior track record of acquisitions is based, in large part, on trial alliances that become deeper partnerships; IBM doesn't try to acquire the hot company or technology of the moment."

According to IDC, a typical enterprise will devote 40% of its IT budget trying to integrate information between different databases and systems. Thus information integration is a key enabler of true on demand business as well as a critical part of IT investment. And it's why IBM is further extending its information integration business with targeted acquisitions such as , and now .
