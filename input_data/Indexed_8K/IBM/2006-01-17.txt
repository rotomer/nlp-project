ARMONK, N.Y., January 17, 2006 . . . IBM today announced fourth-quarter 2005 diluted earnings per common share of $2.01 from continuing operations, including 10 cents per share for a one-time pretax curtailment charge of $267 million relating to changes to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, effective January 1, 2008.  Diluted earnings per share for the fourth-quarter 2005 were $2.11, excluding this one-time charge.  Fourth-quarter income from continuing operations was $3.2 billion, including the one-time charge for pension changes. This compares with $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM chairman and chief executive officer, said: "IBM finished the year with another strong quarter.  We had solid performance in systems, middleware and business transformation services, which grew over 25 percent for the year.  Our cash position remains very strong, and we saw impressive growth in important parts of our business.  We continued to make gains in emerging markets and in important sectors such as healthcare and transportation, and our microprocessors are powering the fast-growing home entertainment market.
 
"Gross profit margin improvement in the quarter of more than 5 points demonstrates the benefit of our strategic focus on more profitable, high-value segments of the IT industry, as well as our continued emphasis on productivity and global integration. IBM's business model is much more balanced and profitable than it was just a few years ago.
 
"IBM is ready for 2006, as we continue to deliver on our agenda of driving innovation and transformation for our clients and their businesses."
