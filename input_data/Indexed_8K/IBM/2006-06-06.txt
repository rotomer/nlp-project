ATTACMENT I
IBM Chairman & CEO Announces Plans To Triple Investment in India Over Next 3 Years
Bangalore, India  June 6, 2006  The chairman and chief executive officer of IBM, Samuel J. Palmisano, speaking to the largest-ever gathering of IBM employees in India, today announced IBM expects to nearly triple its investment in India over the next three years.
Mr. Palmisano spoke before 10,000 employees gathered in Bangalore and via satellite to thousands of other employees in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Pune. With 43,000 employees in 14 cities, India is IBM's largest country organization outside the U.S.
Present at the Bangalore meeting was Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India.
"India and other emerging economies are an increasingly important part of IBM's global success,"  Mr. Palmisano said. "If you are not here in India, making the right investments and finding and developing the best employees and business partners, then you won't be able to combine the skills and expertise here with skills and expertise from around the world, in ways that can help our clients be successful. I'm here today to say that IBM is not going to miss this opportunity.  In the next three years, we will triple our investment in India  from $2 billion over the last three years to nearly $6 billion in the next three years.  That investment will ensure that we make the most of the opportunities to grow this marketplace, while it also enables IBM to fulfill its vision to become a globally integrated company."
Also in attendance during Mr. Palmisano's meeting with IBM India employees were Wall Street analysts, who were attending IBM's first-ever financial analyst meeting in India, Karnataka Governor T.N. Chaturvedi and Karnataka Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.
As immediate steps in its increased investment in India, IBM is:
 establishing the first in a new breed of Service Delivery Centers in Bangalore, deploying new processes and technology that will greatly automate IT service delivery to provide clients with enhanced flexibility and increased worldwide access to skills, service offerings and continuous availability at lower cost.
 creating the IBM Systems & Technology Group (STG) Innovation, Development and Executive Briefing Center in Bangalore, focused on IBM infrastructure solutions, technologies and innovations and providing performance benchmarking, testing, data migration and competency building capabilities.
 locating a Telecommunications Research & Innovation Center at its India Research Lab that will serve as a key resource to IBM's telecommunications clients around the world.
  increasing the capabilities and staff of the High Performance On Demand Solutions Lab in Bangalore, a specialized software and services lab driving automation and virtualization of complex  IT infrastructures.
 inaugurating "The Great Mind Challenge", which is designed to improve the software development skills of Indian students as they work to solve issues facing businesses today.
Advanced Global Services Delivery Network
IBM has formed a new Global Delivery Research and Development organization that pairs researchers from its eight worldwide labs with services delivery experts to reinvent service delivery for IT by creating a virtual global delivery platform unifying IBM's entire network of IT delivery centers. Standard processes and greatly increased automation distribute work seamlessly among the global centers, providing unprecedented levels of reliability for clients via automatic back-up capability. In addition, the automation of service delivery will allow IBM to scale without adding
4
new resources, dramatically lowering costs by reducing the dependence on labor for low-level tasks, such as remote systems monitoring.
This work is being piloted at IBM's Global Service Delivery Center in Bangalore, which runs, not just monitors, IT operations from India for more than 225 clients worldwide, providing high-value complex services, including security and network operations, server and storage management, and hosting.
The new technologies being deployed in India will be rolled out to IBM services centers worldwide in Boulder, Colorado, U.S.; Bratislava, Slovakia; Brno, Czech Republic; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Dublin, Ireland; Hortolndia, Brazil; Johannesburg, South Africa; Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; and Szkesfehrvr, Hungary.
This network of Global Delivery Centers is a key component in IBM's strategy to apply innovation to continually enhance its services delivery model that goes beyond simply lower costs to provide clients with high-value business solutions.
IBM STG Innovation, Development and Executive Briefing Center
The IBM STG Innovation, Development and Executive Briefing Center will provide a one-stop shop for clients to learn about IBM infrastructure solutions and technologies, as well as perform benchmarks for IBM System and Storage products, including proof-of-concept, scaling and performance as well as data migration. The new center will work closely with the STG Development Lab, which is located in the same building.
The center also will focus on Linux competency as IBM increases its focus on Linux in India. Earlier this year, IBM announced greater collaboration with the open source community to improve the development of general Linux kernel functionality. India already has IBM's third largest population of Linux developers. The new center will work closely with the Linux Technology Center, which has been operating in Bangalore since 1999.
The IBM STG Innovation, Development and Executive Briefing Center also will coordinate the development of skills and competencies in IBM hardware and software solutions for IBM Business Partners and ISVs as it provides support leading to additional sales.
Telecommunications Research & Innovation Center
The Telecommunications Research & Innovation Center at the India Research Lab in Delhi, one of  eight IBM research labs around the world, is the latest in a series of industry-specific initiatives designed to tap relevant IBM Research technologies and expertise for collaborative projects with clients and business partners.
The center will focus on such areas as advanced analytics to identify useful information from telecom call center records, network management technologies for improved transaction process monitoring and technologies to allow telecom companies to offer location-based services to their customers.
Located in labs where concentrations of technologies and expertise reside, the local Research team actually serves as both a global resource for a specific industry as well as a conduit for clients and partners into IBM Research at large. With more than 3,000 scientists, IBM Research helps businesses, governments and other organizations differentiate themselves in their respective fields through innovation.
High Performance On Demand Solutions Lab
The High Performance On Demand Solutions Lab (HiPODs), the first-of-its-kind lab in India, connects IBM's top consultants, developers, engineers and researchers in India and around the world, culminating in the most comprehensive skills and resources available in the industry today. IBM will further enhance its ability to leverage the best of Indian talent and IBM's global innovation leadership by increasing staffing of the lab.
5
 
Customers bring their applications to this dynamic infrastructure lab to validate their performance, scalability and solutions needs before deploying them in a business environment. The specialists at the HiPODS team then work with the customers to tune their application to facilitate optimal performance. The lab was inaugurated in February 2006 and already has worked with more than 40 customers to transform and support their business critical activities.
The lab and other IBM HiPODS Labs located in various regions of the world are responsible for facilitating billions of transactions every day from the company's many high-volume customer engagements.
The Great Mind Challenge
As part of its Academic Initiative in India, IBM, along with IBM Business Partners, will launch "The Great Mind Challenge" in which students at the country's engineering schools will develop software based on various project scenarios. Mentors from IBM will work with the students, and there also will be a series of training sessions as students learn how to collaborate to solve business problems. The top 20 projects will be put on the Internet to be used without charge by end users and IBM Business Partners. The program will begin June 15 and continue through the end of this year.
This Challenge is an outgrowth of IBM's efforts to collaborate with local governments and university students to create a repository of innovative solutions that are available free to government agencies, solution providers and academia.
Project INVITE (Initiative to Nurture a Vibrant Information Technology Ecosystem), another offering through IBM's Academic Initiative, already has created more than 25 e-governance solutions and projects developed on open source software and open standard technologies. More than 3,400 students across 155 institutions across India have participated in Project INVITE since it began in June 2005By involving university students, the initiative seeks to help universities keep their IT curricula current and responsive to the needs of the Indian job market.

Final Remarks, as Prepared
 
IBM Global Briefing
Bangalore, India
 
June 6, 2006
 
 
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and may I once again welcome you, officially, to Bangalore, and to this global briefing for IBM investors.
 
We knew before we left home that this would be no ordinary event. And what we witnessed this morning  an event showcasing the remarkable innovations being generated by this dynamic economy  was extraordinary indeed.
 
As you heard this morning, IBM India has grown to become the number one IT company in India, in terms of
domestic revenue, and the largest multinational employer in the country, with some 43,000 IBM colleagues at work in our systems, software and services businesses. These IBMers serve a rapidly expanding domestic market  the IT industry here is growing 13 percent a year.
 
But even more importantly, they are also part of a new kind of organization that isn't designed simply country-by-country, but on a truly planet-wide model. As recently reported, Bangalore has become the epicenter for some of IBM's most important global projects.
BusinessWeek
 
And that, in turn, is the real message of this conference  and why we're holding it here. The

subject is
.
IBM ... but the lessons are about the
emerging, innovation-based global economy
 
Obviously, we didn't need to bring you all to India just to tell you about IBM. Nor did we need the occasion of an IBM business overview to arrange a guided tour of Bangalore. The reason it was important to open up is that we believe the meeting's location will affect the nature of the discussion. Hearing directly from Asia-based thinkers, CEOs, scholars and officials  and putting them together with those who analyze the industries in which IBM participates  will, we think, produce a different kind of exchange .... on both sides.
this
specific exchange of views in particular place
this
 
As I have reported to you, several years ago we predicted several fundamental shifts in the information technology industry and in the global business environment. We took a series of actions to take advantage of those shifts. Now, you are seeing the benefits of these actions in our results. They position us to deliver on our business model on a sustainable basis, and they also give us greater flexibility to focus on growth and profit opportunities.
 
Let me highlight of these fundamental shifts.
three
The first is the , brought about by the relentless cycle of innovation and commoditization. Some companies have chosen to compete on price, speed and efficiency. That's tough  and it gets tougher every day, with ongoing consolidation and commoditzation in some industry segments. IBM has chosen to compete on our capacity for high-value innovation. We believe this is a .
bifurcation of the IT industry
better long-term bet
 
You know that IBM is today the world leader in servers, in middleware, and IT services and consulting. In each of those businesses, we have dramatically shifted from commoditizing segments toward higher-value businesses with better profit opportunities. You've seen the changes in our business portfolio, where we divested of businesses that thrived during the PC Era  hard disk
drives, panels, and eventually, PCs themselves  and strengthened our position in higher-growth, higher-value segments. Through organic investment, divestitures and acquisitions, we have fundamentally remade our company.
 
As a result of these shifts, coupled with innovations in our operations, we have improved our gross profit margins over the past five years. Our GPM improved 3.2 points last year alone. And IBM's margin today is at a and we remain intently focused on our margins going forward.
nine-year high,
 
Our .
cash story is also compelling
 
Management view of cash generated from each dollar of revenue has increased nearly 50 percent in the last 6
years. Today over 10 percent of every dollar of revenue is available for new investment, in addition to our capital expenditures, or distribution to shareholders.
 
The second basic shift is . We began a couple of years ago to transform IBM into a globally integrated enterprise  a transformation that entailed a restructuring of our operations to enable us to draw more efficiently on our global resources, and to capitalize on opportunities in emerging growth markets.
globalization
 
We began with our restructuring in Europe, where we implemented the most extensive changes to our management system in nearly 50 years. We eliminated layers of bureaucracy and moved more resources out into local markets, closer to our clients.
Our leaner management system, coupled with solid execution and a slowly improving business environment, is enabling us to compete more effectively in the European markets. We're beginning to see the benefits of these initiatives.
 
At the same time, across IBM we have taken core processes and functions that were once managed regionally, shifted them to an and manage them globally. We have improved responsiveness to our clients through new ways to bring together sales support. We call these "deal hubs," and in the parts of Europe where we tried them out, our win rates improved dramatically. We are currently rolling them out around the world. As a matter of fact, we launched our first deal hub in India just yesterday.
integrated model
In aggregate, these changes have . They have also given us much greater flexibility to locate business functions where the necessary skills reside, and to redeploy people and teams wherever market opportunities dictate. As one recent example, John Paterson, IBM's chief procurement officer, will be re-locating from Somers, New York, to Shenzhen, China, and will run our global procurement operations from there.
flattened hierarchies, eliminated redundancies and improved productivity
 
We have of people working in or serving markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia  surging economies where our business, excluding PCs, grew 23 percent last year.
tripled the number
I refer to all of this activity as   The reason we can do this  the reason we're able to undertake this redistribution of decision-making and operations  is because of the new, fully networked, global computing environment that makes this kind of integration possible.
"."
lowering the center of gravity of the company
 
That's the in the world's business environment that I referred to earlier  the shift to a post-PC, networked computing environment, one that has evolved beyond communications and trading into a true business platform.
third major shift
The Internet today is a network of more than a billion people and hundreds of billions of things  embedded objects and intelligent devices, all interconnected and integrated thanks to open standards and technologies such as Linux and web services. This platform is what enables the globally integrated enterprise to emerge, and it is giving rise to all manner of new business services and applications, developed for and delivered via the Net.
 
IBM is a leader in the technologies, systems, integration software and collaborative solutions that drive and sustain this vital platform for global business.
Finally, all of these macro-trends  the onrush of commoditization; the emergence of the globally integrated enterprise; and the move to a networked computing and business platform  told us that our clients would place a premium on two related priorities: . And from this recognition, we have crafted what is perhaps IBM's strongest competitive advantage  and .
integration and innovation
one that is unique to IBM
 
The integration of technology with business design has become a competitive necessity in the 21st century. As new technologies get infused into every aspect of business and society, organizations have no choice but to engage. The integration of business and technology is also the source of innovation  which business and government leaders recognize as the surest path to
survival and growth in an intensely competitive global market.
 
Innovation today goes beyond novel products and services. It involves every aspect of the enterprise  from business processes and business models, to management systems, culture and policies.
 
In a global survey conducted by IBM's business consulting unit earlier this year, 83 percent of CEOs said they were focused on business model innovation. Driving their interest was the fear that business model innovation by their competitors could radically change their industry's landscape.
That's the stick' driving businesses to undertake comprehensive, enterprise-wide innovation. The carrot,' the glass-half-full part of this historical moment, is that an incredible array of new capabilities has come of age  embedded technology, pervasive connectivity, supercomputing, the ability to extract insight from oceans of information, global skill and scale  all of this is available to every business and institution.
 
When we say "It's a great time to be an innovator," this is why.
 
As a result of all the actions we have taken, IBM has emerged as a than we were just a few years ago, with continuing strong cash flow and a sharper focus on the opportunities of our industry.
more productive, more profitable company

As you know, IBM today is built
.
on three major business units  services, software and systems  and our ability to integrate the capabilities of these businesses for our clients
 
During the course of the day tomorrow, you will hear from the leaders of each of these lines of business about their strategies and business models. In addition, they will highlight how they work together to integrate IBM for
clients, and they will describe the new opportunities we are pursuing to grow our company.
 
In   as you know, we've been adjusting our strategy to address the shift to smaller-sized opportunities. At the same time, we're continuing our aggressive advance into the high-growth marketplace for business performance services, or BPS. This is the business of applying technology expertise and global economies of scale to transform and run business processes for our clients  everything from supply chain, to human resources, to logistics and more. Last year, our BPS revenue increased 28 percent, to $4 billion.
services,
 
We recently created a new unit, led by Erich Clementi, to consolidate and accelerate our efforts in BPS, including
a promising new opportunity to deliver more standardized business processing services, mainly to smaller enterprises. Erich and Mike Daniels will tell you about their business model and the strategic shifts they are pursuing.
 
In we have been focusing our internal R&D and acquisitions to strengthen our capability in the high-growth middleware segment. Last year, we improved our competitive position in all five of our key middleware brands. Significantly, for the first time, more than half of our software revenue came from these strategic middleware products. This mix enables our software group to deliver its business model with more consistency.
software,
As our success in middleware proves, companies are looking for open, standards-based software solutions to help integrate their IT systems and dissolve the barriers that impede the flow of information within the enterprise. There is a simultaneous shift underway toward service-oriented architecture  or "SOA"  which enables companies to be much more flexible and responsive. As the global leader in middleware, IBM is in a strong position to capitalize on the SOA software and services opportunity, which over the next two years is expected to more than double, to $143 billion.
 
Our strategy in our is to continue to gain share, as we have done the last five years.
systems business
In addition, our systems business is pursuing a growth strategy around core

technologies and R&D collaboration with clients
As you know, we made a strategic play in consumer electronics to be a provider of high-value components and design services, as opposed to end-user products. Our focus on is generating double-digit growth in microelectronics. Revenue from our 300-millimeter wafer products grew more than 250 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, and another 200 percent in the first quarter of this year. Our has made a clean sweep of the industry's three major game platforms. And the broad potential of IBM's Cell and POWER microprocessors  in healthcare, defense

very promising
 
This is not simply an OEM business. This is about collaborating with the R&D operations of our clients. You will recall that we created our Engineering & Technology Services business in 2003 to pursue these opportunities. More recently, we combined this business with our microelectronics business, technology development and manufacturing, intellectual property operations and our OEM sales to create a new unit called Technology Collaboration Solutions. This unit, led by Adalio Sanchez, is designed to capitalize on the growing demand for collaborative innovation. You'll hear more about this from Adalio and Bill Zeitler tomorrow.
 
When you step back and look at our major businesses and how we have them over the past decade, I think a couple of points stand out.
reshaped
 
our services, software and systems and hardware/financing businesses are in terms of profit contribution to IBM. Each of these three units represents a mix of emerging, high-growth businesses and more mature, slower-growing, but highly profitable businesses   which generate substantial cash and fuel our investments in new market opportunities.

In , we are reinventing the business services industry by leading a shift from labor-based to asset-based approaches, through the intimate integration of advanced science, technology and algorithms into business processes and operations. At the same time, we have exercised great discipline in pursuing contracts and have walked away from opportunities that may have yielded short-term revenue but had what we considered unacceptable financial risk.
services
 
Third, we are winning in the marketplace.
IBM is the world leader in middleware, with a 18 percent share; in services, with over 7 percent  share  more than twice the size of our nearest services competitor; and in servers, with a 33 percent share.
 
Two weeks ago, Gartner  reported that IBM gained ground on Dell and Hewlett-Packard in the server market during the first quarter, with a 19 percent gain in shipments   faster than the overall pace of the market. And according to a new IDC report, IBM took the number one position in total storage hardware in the fourth quarter of 2005.

IBM Global Services
 
As in past decades, when the IT industry moved from one computing model to another, IBM is again leading the shift to a very different era for our industry. We are putting distance between us and our competitors. We like our competitive position going forward.
 
Today's meeting will begin with a broad-ranging discussion of and its implications by a panel of business leaders and government officials, as well as an expert from the Harvard Business School. I believe our panel will provide a good backdrop for tomorrow's discussion  and also provoke some stimulating conversations over dinner.
global integration
 
Following our panel, Doug Elix will discuss how we are capturing growth opportunities in the emerging markets of India, China, Russia and Brazil. Joining him are our general managers of each of those country operations.
Then Bob Moffat will describe to you how we are capitalizing on and integrating the skills, economics and scale now available in these markets and throughout the world, and how we are bringing this integrated capability to bear for our clients and for our own productivity and operational effectiveness.
 
 
Let me with just a few words about the subject of this afternoon's panel   .

One of our hopes for this session  beyond giving you a deep dive into IBM's own globally integrated model and operations  is to spark dialogue about I believe

gaps between the promise of the developing world and some of today's thorny realities
 
Are there gaps?
 
We all know there are. For one, there remain serious roadblocks to the full integration of the emerging world.
 
Will it be a smooth entry and integration with the developed world, or a rough one?

Will India, China and Brazil be successful in extending the benefits and opportunities of their rising middle classes and cities to their large populations of rural poor?
 - 
                 
Conversely, will fear and protectionist impulses derail the rich opportunities before us, not just for the creation of new wealth, but for global integration at a deeper level  in the public policy, cultural and environmental realms?
 - 
                 
 
One reason I think it's especially for leaders in the developed world  including those who participate in and follow the IT industry  to spend time in India, China and other emerging markets is to recognize that . This

IBM was cited in a recent INSEAD study as one of only nine truly global corporations. We believe that we can help emerging regions, not just as a supplier of advanced technology, but as a deeply experienced global institution ... one that has learned over nearly a century what it means to be a progressive world citizen.

Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials June 6, 2006
 2006 IBM Corporation
In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discussed the following non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.
 
Constant Currency
 
Management refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Company's businesses performance. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
Divested PC Business
 
On April 30, 2005, IBM sold its PC business. Management believes that it is important to investors to understand the financial results of the company adjusted for the impact of its divested PCD operations in order to show IBM's results on a comparable basis year-to-year, and to best present ongoing operational performance. Accordingly, management has presented certain financial results excluding the effects of the PC business.
 
Consistent with the company's management system, its reportable segments include transactions between segments that are intended to reflect an arm's-length transfer price and include intercompany profit. Management believes that a more appropriate measure of the financial impacts that the divestiture of the PC business has on IBM's consolidated financial results should exclude any revenues associated with internal sales and intercompany profits, which are eliminated in consolidation. Accordingly, the results of the PC business have been adjusted from the reported PC segment. The basis for these adjustments are to give effect to intercompany and certain allocated expenses and the adjusted results are intended to display the impact on the IBM consolidated results on a basis comparable to which the company operates post-PC divestiture which management believes is meaningful and useful to investors.
Management View of Cash Flow
 
Management includes a presentation of cash flows that excludes the effect of Global Financing Receivables and subtracts net capital investments from Net Cash from Operations.  For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth.  Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Capital investments are necessary to grow and sustain the business. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity, which currently has the effect of lowering cash from operations, and net capital investments as a reduction of Net cash from Operations.  Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment, in addition to our capital expenditures, or for distribution to shareholders.
 
Stock-based Compensation
 
Additionally, certain financial results have been restated to reflect the company's adoption of expensing of stock based compensation in 2005. However, given certain data limitations, selected financial results (e.g. cash flows from operations in 1999) have been presented without the effects of equity compensation.
 
The above serves to reconcile the Non-GAAP financial information included in Sam Palmisano's Welcome Remarks
and Slide 16 of Doug Elix's "Emerging Markets" Presentation. See Slides 2 and 3 of this presentation for additional information on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures.
 
The above serves to reconcile the Non-GAAP financial information on Slide 15 of Doug Elix's "Emerging Markets" Presentation. See Slides 2 and 3 of this presentation for additional information on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures.
 
* Does not include effects of equity compensation expensing. See Slide 4 of this presentation for additional information.
 
May not add due to rounding
 
The above serves to reconcile certain Non-GAAP financial information regarding management's view of cash generated from reported revenues, included in Sam Palmisano's Welcome Remarks. See Slide 4 of this presentation for additional information on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures.
