Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials June 7, 2006
 
In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discussed the following non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.
 
 
Constant Currency
 
Management refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Company's business performance.  Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
Non-recurring Items/Special Actions
 
Management has presented certain financial results excluding the effects of the following one-time items: (1) a 2Q 2005 gain on the sale of the company's PC business, (2) a 2Q 2005 gain related to a settlement agreement reached with Microsoft, (3) 2Q 2005 charges related to the company's restructuring initiatives, (4) a one-time 3Q 2005 tax charge for the repatriation of foreign earnings, (5) a 4Q 2005 one-time curtailment charge relating to changes to the company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans, (6) a one-time charge recorded in 3Q 2004 for the partial settlement of certain legal claims related to IBM's pension plan and (7) the operational performance of the company's divested PC business. Given the unique and non-recurring nature of these items, management believes that presenting certain financial information without these items is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors.
 
Additionally, the company has presented certain financial results excluding the effects of special actions in 1999, 2002 and 2005. Given the unique and non-recurring nature of these items (both gains and losses), management believes that presenting certain financial results without the effects of such actions is more representative of the company's operational performance and year-over-year dynamics.
Divested PC Business
 
On April 30, 2005, IBM sold its PC business. Management believes that it is important to investors to understand the financial results of the company adjusted for the impact of its divested PCD operations in order to show IBM's results on a comparable basis year-to-year, and to best present ongoing operational performance. Accordingly, management has presented certain financial results excluding the effects of the PC business.
 
Consistent with the company's management system, its reportable segments include transactions between segments that are intended to reflect an arm's-length transfer price and include intercompany profit. Management believes that a more appropriate measure of the financial impacts that the divestiture of the PC business has on IBM's consolidated financial results should exclude any revenues associated with internal sales and intercompany profits, which are eliminated in consolidation. Accordingly, the results of the PC business have been adjusted from the reported PC segment. The basis for these adjustments are to give effect to intercompany and certain allocated expenses and the adjusted results are intended to display the impact on the IBM consolidated results on a basis comparable to which the company operates post-PC divestiture which management believes is meaningful and useful to investors.
Management View of Cash Flow
 
Management includes a presentation of cash flows that excludes the effect of Global Financing Receivables and subtracts net capital investments from Net Cash from Operations.   For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth.  Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset.  Capital investments are necessary to grow and sustain the business. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity, which currently has the effect of lowering cash from operations, and net capital investments as a reduction of Net cash from Operations.  Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment, in addition to our capital expenditures, or for distribution to shareholders.
 
Additionally, management has presented its view of cash flow excluding the effects of funding of its U.S. pension plans. Given the unique nature of such pension fundings and the  complexity and volatility associated with the accounting and financial reporting for  pension plans, management believes that presenting these financial items without such fundings is useful to investors in better understanding the company's business performance. The Company believes the magnitude of these impacts can affect investors' understanding of the Company's overall business performance.  Management further believes that investors' understanding is enhanced when the year-to-year dynamics is rendered explicit in the discussion of the Company's financial results.
Stock-based Compensation
 
Additionally, certain financial results have been restated to reflect the company's adoption of expensing of stock-based compensation in 2005. However, given certain data limitations, selected financial results (gross margin, expense to revenue ratio and cash flows from operations) from 1995  2000 have been presented without the effects of equity compensation in those years.
 
Estimated PTI for Acquisitions
 
Management presents selected references of estimated pre-tax income (PTI) margin for acquired entities, with and with out amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. Management believes that presenting such results without the non-cash amortization expense of acquired intangible assets is more representative of the acquired entity's operational performance and IBM's return on its investment, which may be more useful for investors.
