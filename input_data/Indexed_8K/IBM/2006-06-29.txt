On June 28, 2006, International Business Machines Corporation (the "Company") entered into a new 5-year $10,000,000,000 Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement replaces the Company's existing 5-year $10,000,000,000 Credit Agreement (the "Existing Credit Agreement") dated May 27, 2004. The Existing Credit Agreement was not otherwise due to expire until May 27, 2009.
The Credit Agreement is entered into among the Company, each Subsidiary Borrower (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time parties to the Credit Agreement (the "Lenders"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent for the Lenders, and Citibank, N.A., as Syndication Agent.
The Credit Agreement permits the Company and its Subsidiary Borrowers to borrow up to $10 billion on a revolving basis. Borrowings of the Subsidiary Borrowers will be unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. The Company may also, upon the agreement of either the then existing Lenders, or of additional banks not currently party to the Credit Agreement, increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement up to an additional $2.0 billion. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, the Company and Subsidiary Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. Funds borrowed may be used for the general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the support of outstanding commercial paper issuances of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement terminates on June 28, 2011. Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be based on prevailing market interest rates, as further described in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, events of default, and indemnification provisions.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated by reference herein.
In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the Lenders and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in commercial banking, investment banking, financial advisory or other services with the Company and its affiliates for which they have in the past and/or may in the future receive customary compensation and expense reimbursement.

Inability to Determine Interest Rate
(a)           the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or
(b)           the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,
the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans and (y) any US$ Loans that, on the first day of such Interest Period, were to have been converted to or continued as Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as or converted to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall any Borrower have the right to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans.

Each payment (including each prepayment other than any prepayment made pursuant to Section 3.2(f)) by a Borrower on account of principal of and interest on Eurodollar Loans designated by a Borrower to be applied to a particular Eurodollar Tranche shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Eurodollar Loans then held by the Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment other than any prepayment made pursuant to Section 3.2(f)) by any Swing Line Borrower on account of principal of and interest on Swing Line Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Swing Line Loans or participating interests therein, as the case may be, then held by the relevant Lenders. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by a Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest,
Pro Rata Treatment and Payments
27
fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 11.2, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on Eurodollar Loans or Index Rate Competitive Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan or an Index Rate Competitive Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension) unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. The provisions of this Section 2.15(a) shall, to the extent applicable, be subject to the procedures set forth in Section 2.21.
(b)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.15(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, on demand, from the relevant Borrower.
2.16         . Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans or Index Rate Competitive Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be cancelled, (b) such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law and (c) the relevant Borrower shall, with respect to any Index Rate Competitive Loan of such Lender, take such action as such Lender may reasonably request.
Illegality
2.17         . (a)  If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law applicable to any Lender or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Effective Date (or, in the case of Index Rate Competitive Loans, made subsequent to acceptance by a Borrower of such Loan):

(iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or Index Rate Competitive Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the relevant Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17(a), it shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
(b)           If any Lender shall have determined that any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority, in each case made subsequent to the Effective Date, does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such application or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, such Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
(c)           Each Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender which requests compensation under this Section 2.17(c) (by notice to such Borrower), on the last day of each Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender or on the Competitive Loan Maturity Date with respect to any Index Rate Competitive Loan made by such Lender, as the case may be, so long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board (or, so long as such Lender may be required by the Board or by any other Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans or Index Rate Competitive Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which includes any Eurodollar Loans or Index Rate Competitive Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Lender and notified to the relevant Borrower) representing such Lender's calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such reasonable means of allocation as such Lender shall determine) of the actual costs, if any, incurred by such Lender during such Interest Period or during the period such Index Rate Competitive Loan was outstanding (a ""), as the case may be, as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such Eurodollar Loans or Index Rate Competitive Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of the following for each day of such Interest Period or Competitive Loan Period:

(ii)           the difference between (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the Eurodollar Rate or the Applicable Index Rate, as the case may be (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such Eurodollar Loan or Index Rate Competitive Loan, and the denominator of which is one minus the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed by the Board or other Governmental Authority on such date minus (y) such numerator; and
(iii)          a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is 360.
Any Lender which gives notice under this Section 2.17(c) shall promptly withdraw such notice (by written notice of withdrawal given to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Borrowers) in the event such Lender is no longer required to maintain such reserves or the circumstances giving rise to such notice shall otherwise cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be entitled to request compensation under this Section 2.17(c) with respect to any Index Rate Competitive Loan if it shall have obtained actual knowledge of the change giving rise to such request at the time of submission of such Lender's Competitive Loan Offer pursuant to which such Competitive Loan shall have been made, unless notice of such Lender's entitlement to such compensation shall have been furnished to the relevant Borrower at or prior to such time.
and (ii) a Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.17 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies such Borrower of the change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to in this clause (ii) shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. Each Lender agrees to use its best efforts to notify the relevant Borrower as promptly as practicable after obtaining knowledge of any such costs or reductions. The obligations of the Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the US$ Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.17, no Lender shall demand compensation for any increased cost or reduction or other amount referred to above if such demand would be arbitrary or exceptional in light of similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements.
A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.17 submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the relevant Borrower shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the request for compensation of such additional amounts and the method of computation thereof and shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding sentence, the relevant Borrower shall (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.17(c)) pay each Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it within 30 days after receipt thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.17, (i) each Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this Section 2.17 for only such costs as are incurred or reductions as are suffered as to which a certificate has been delivered in accordance with the terms of this paragraph (d) within 90 days after such Lender obtained actual knowledge of such costs or reductions

Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by any Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter such Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender (or Transferee), as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by such Borrower showing payment thereof. If any Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, such Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (or Transferees) for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (or Transferee) as a result of any such failure.

Each Lender will immediately transfer to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation, and the proceeds of such participation shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to each relevant Local Currency Lender in such amount as will reduce the amount of the participating interest retained by such Local Currency Lender in the Converted Local Currency Loans to the amount of the ABR Loans which were to have been made by it pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 3.3. All Converted Local Currency Loans shall bear interest at the rate which would otherwise be applicable to ABR Loans.

(b)           Any additional bank, financial institution or other entity which is not already a Lender, with the consent of IBM and the Administrative Agent (which consent, in the case of the Administrative Agent, shall not be unreasonably withheld), can elect to become a party to this Agreement and obtain a Revolving Credit Commitment; such party shall execute a New Lender Supplement (each, a "") with IBM and the Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit I-1, whereupon such bank, financial institution or other entity (herein called a "") shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement.

(c)           Any Lender (other than any New Lender) which agrees to provide an incremental Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 11.23 shall execute an Incremental Commitment Supplement (each, an "") with IBM and the Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit I-2, whereupon such Lender shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement with respect to the incremental Revolving Credit Commitment specified therein, and Schedule 1.1 shall be deemed to be amended to reflect such incremental Revolving Credit Commitment.
Incremental Commitment Supplement
(d)           If, on the date upon which any Lender (including any New Lender) provides an incremental Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 11.23, there is an unpaid principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans, IBM shall borrow Revolving Credit Loans from such Lender in an amount determined by reference to the amount of each Type of Revolving Credit Loan (and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, of each Eurodollar Tranche) which would then have been outstanding from such Lender if (i) each such Type or Eurodollar Tranche had been borrowed on the date such Lender's incremental Revolving Credit Commitment was provided, in each case after giving effect thereto and (ii) the aggregate amount of each such Type or Eurodollar Tranche requested to be so borrowed had been increased to the extent necessary to give effect, with respect to such Lender, to the borrowing allocation provisions of Section 2.2. Any Eurodollar Loan borrowed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall bear interest at a rate equal to the respective interest rates then applicable to the Eurodollar Loans of the other Lenders in the same Eurodollar Tranche.
(e)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.23, (i) the aggregate amount of incremental Revolving Credit Commitments provided pursuant to this Section 11.23 shall not exceed $2,000,000,000 and (ii) no Lender shall have any obligation to provide an incremental Revolving Credit Commitment unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion.

Credit Agreement
IBM
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to the Administrative Agent in connection with the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 5.1(d)(i) of the Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement.
In arriving at the opinion expressed below, we have examined (a) a counterpart of the Credit Agreement, signed by IBM and the Administrative Agent and (b) such documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity, regularity and completeness of all documents submitted to us as originals, the completeness of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or as certified or conformed copies and the conformity of such documents to the original documents.
We have also assumed that the Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by IBM, that IBM is duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation and has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement, that IBM is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, that the execution, delivery and performance by IBM of the Credit Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of IBM, do not contravene its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational documents or violate, or require any consent not obtained under, any applicable law or regulation or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or other Governmental Authority binding upon IBM and do not violate, or require any consent not obtained under, any contractual obligation applicable to or binding upon IBM, and that the Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and each Subsidiary Borrower.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and comments set forth below, we are of the opinion that, insofar as the law of the State of New York is concerned, the Credit Agreement (including the guarantee contained in Section 10 thereof) constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of IBM, enforceable against IBM in accordance with its terms, except as affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, except that we express no opinion as to (a) Section 11.17(b) of the Credit Agreement insofar as it relates to an action brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and note that such matters may be raised by such court; (b) any indemnification obligations of IBM under the Credit Agreement to the extent such obligations might be deemed to be inconsistent with public policy; (c) the provisions of Section 11.6 of the Credit Agreement purporting to grant to Participants a right to set-off; (d) any provision of the Credit Agreement that purports to establish an evidentiary standard for determinations by the Lenders or the Administrative Agent; (e) Section 11.12(b) of the Credit Agreement to the extent that it provides for (i) a right of set-off in respect of participating interests purchased pursuant to Section 11.12(a) of the Credit Agreement, (ii) a right of set-off in respect of claims, credits or other obligations that are contingent or (iii) a right of set-off in respect of Borrower Obligations against deposits, indebtedness or other obligations of any entity other than the entity to which such Borrower Obligations are payable; (f) Section 10.7 or Section 11.17(d) of the Credit Agreement; or (g) any Local Currency Facility.
With respect to our opinion as to the guarantee contained in Section 10 of the Credit Agreement, we note that (i) a New York statute provides that with respect to a foreign currency obligation, a court of the State of New York shall render a judgment or decree in such foreign currency and such judgment or decree shall be converted into currency of the United States at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of such judgment or decree and (ii) with respect to a foreign currency obligation, a United States Federal court in New York may award judgment in United States dollars, provided that we express no opinion as to the rate of exchange such
2
court would apply.
We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York.
This opinion has been rendered solely for your benefit in connection with the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by or furnished to any other Person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,
SIMPSON THACHER & BARTLETT LLP

EXHIBIT D-2 TO
5-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT
June 28, 2006          
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Andrew Bonzani, Assistant General Counsel of International Business Machines Corporation, a New York corporation ("IBM"), and have advised IBM in connection with the $10,000,000,000 5-Year Credit Agreement dated as of June 28, 2006 (the "Credit Agreement"), among IBM, each Subsidiary Borrower (as defined therein), the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto (the "Lenders"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and Citibank, N.A., as Syndication Agent. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.
In connection with this opinion, I have investigated such questions of law, received such information from officers and representatives of IBM and the Subsidiary Borrowers and examined such certificates of public officials, corporate documents and records of IBM and the Subsidiary Borrowers and other documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. I have relied, with respect to certain factual matters not constituting conclusions of law, on the representations and warranties of IBM and the Subsidiary Borrowers contained in the Credit Agreement and assume compliance on the part of each such corporation with its covenants and agreements under the Credit Agreement.
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed (i) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement by all parties thereto (other than IBM), (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and (iii) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies.
Based upon the foregoing, I am of opinion that:
1.           IBM has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where the failure to so qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect. IBM has the requisite corporate power and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry on its business in all material respects as now conducted. Each Significant Subsidiary has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and is duly qualified as a foreign
1
corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where the failure to so qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Significant Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power and authority to lease the property it operates under lease and to carry on its business in all material respects as now conducted.
2.           The execution, delivery and performance by IBM of the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 10 thereof) and the Transactions (a) are within the corporate power of IBM; (b) have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action; (c) do not (i) violate (A) any provisions of law, statute, material rule or material regulation of the United States or the State of New York, or of the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constitutive documents or by-laws of IBM or any Significant Subsidiary, (B) to the best of my knowledge, any material order of any United States Federal or New York Governmental Authority or (C) any provision of any material indenture or other material agreement or material instrument known to me to which IBM or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or any of their property is or may be bound, (ii) conflict with, or result in a breach of or constitute (alone or with notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any such material indenture or other material agreement or material instrument or (iii) except as contemplated by Section 7.1 of the Credit Agreement, result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired by IBM or any Significant Subsidiary; and (d) do not require the consent or approval of, or any registration or filing with, or any other action by, any United States Federal or New York Governmental Authority or any other person party to those agreements described above other than (i) those that have been made or obtained and are in full force and effect or as to which the failure to be made or obtained or to be in full force and effect would not result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) such periodic and current reports, if any, as are required to be filed with the SEC to disclose the Credit Agreement or the Transactions contemplated thereunder and (iii) such filings as may hereafter be required pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1 of the Credit Agreement to perfect security interests securing the Borrower Obligations.
3.           The Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 10 thereof) has been duly executed and delivered by IBM.
4.           The Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of IBM, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and by general principles of equity (including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing) regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and except that (a) insofar as provisions of the Credit Agreement provide for indemnification, the enforcement thereof may be limited by public policy considerations, (b) I express no opinion as to (i) Section 11.12(b) of the Credit Agreement to the extent that it provides for (A) a right of set-off in respect of participating interests purchased pursuant to Section 11.12(a) of the Credit Agreement, (B) a right of set-off in respect of claims, credits or other obligations that are contingent or (C) a right of set-off in respect of Borrower Obligations against deposits, indebtedness or other obligations of any entity other than the entity to which such Borrower Obligations are payable, or (ii) the fourth sentence of Section 11.6 of the Credit Agreement, (c) I express no opinion as to (i)

whether a United States Federal court or a court of the State of New York would render a money judgment in a currency other than United States Dollars or enforce a judgment expressed in a foreign currency in a currency other than United States Dollars and (ii) the rate of exchange a United States Federal court or a court of the State of New York would apply, (d) I express no opinion as to (i) Section 11.17(b) of the Credit Agreement insofar as it relates to an action brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and note that such matters may be raised by such court or (ii) Section 11.17(d) of the Credit Agreement and (e) I express no opinion as to Section 10.7 of the Credit Agreement.
5.           IBM is not an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940.
6.           The use of proceeds of any Loan under the Credit Agreement, in the manner contemplated in the Credit Agreement, will not entail a violation of any of the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
7.           To the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, except as set forth in the Form 10-K of IBM for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 or the Form 10-Q of IBM for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2006, there are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity or by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority now pending or threatened by or against IBM or any of the Significant Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective properties or revenues as of the date hereof (i) which involve the Credit Agreement or any of the actions contemplated thereby or (ii) as to which there is a probable risk of an adverse decision which would materially restrict the ability of IBM to comply with its obligations under the Credit Agreement.
I express no opinion herein as to (i) any Local Currency Facility or (i) the creation, perfection, priority or enforceability of any lien or security interest that may hereafter be granted to secure the Borrower Obligations pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1 of the Credit Agreement. In rendering the opinions expressed in paragraphs 2 and 4 above, I have assumed with your permission that no Lender and no assignee or transferee of any Loan or participation therein will be a "broker" or "dealer" (as defined in Sections 3(a)(4) and 3(a)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) or any other person which is a "creditor" as defined in Regulation T.
          I am admitted to practice in the State of New York and express no opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the United States of America.
Very truly yours,
