Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa were $7.3 billion, up 6 percent (2 percent, adjusting for currency).

Revenues from Tivoli software, infrastructure software that enables customers to centrally manage networks including security and storage capability, increased 44 percent, and revenues for Lotus software, which allows collaborating and messaging by customers in real-time communication and knowledge management, increased 8 percent year over year.  Revenues from Rational software, integrated tools to improve the processes of software development, increased 2 percent compared with the year-ago quarter.
 
     Revenues from Global Services increased 3 percent (2 percent, adjusting for currency) to $12.0 billion in the third quarter of 2006.  IBM signed services contracts totaling $10.5 billion and ended the quarter with an estimated services backlog, including Strategic Outsourcing, Business Transformation Outsourcing, Global Business Services, Integrated Technology Services and Maintenance, of $109 billion.
 
     Hardware revenues increased 9 percent (8 percent, adjusting for currency) to $5.6 billion in the third-quarter 2006 compared to $5.1 billion in the year-ago period.  Systems and Technology Group (S&TG) revenues totaled $5.5 billion for the quarter, up 10 percent.  S&TG revenues from System z server products increased 25 percent compared with the year-ago period.

     IBM's effective tax rate in the third-quarter 2006 was 30.0 percent, compared with 48.0 percent in the third quarter of 2005.  The tax rate decrease was substantially driven by the incremental tax charge of $525 million in the third quarter of 2005 related to the company's repatriation of foreign earnings.
 
     Share repurchases totaled approximately $1.6 billion in the third quarter.  The weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding in the third-quarter 2006 was 1.53 billion compared with 1.62 billion shares in the same period of 2005.  As of September 30, 2006, there were 1.51 billion basic common shares outstanding.
 
     IBM ended the third quarter of 2006 with $10.9 billion of cash on hand.  The balance sheet remains strong, and the company is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities.
 
     Debt, including Global Financing, totaled $22.0 billion, compared with $22.6 billion at year-end 2005.  From a management segment view, the non- global financing debt-to-capitalization ratio was 2.3 percent at the end of September 30, 2006, and Global Financing debt increased $771 million from year-end 2005 to a total of $21.3 billion, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 6.9 to 1.
