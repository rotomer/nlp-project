THREE
:            (1) Subject to the provisions of the By-laws, as from time to time amended, with respect to the closing of the transfer books and the fixing of a record date, each share of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to one vote on all matters requiring a vote of the stockholders and, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock issued under this Article FOUR, shall be entitled to receive such dividends, in cash, securities, or property, as may from time to time be declared by the Board of Directors.  In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, after payment shall have been made to the holders of preferred stock of the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Article FOUR, the holders of capital stock shall be entitled, to the exclusion of the holders of the preferred stock of any series, to share ratably, according to the number of shares held by them, in all remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution.
FOUR
(2) The Board of Directors is authorized, at any time or from time to time, to issue preferred stock and (i) to divide the shares of preferred stock into series; (ii) to determine the designation for any such series by number, letter, or title that shall distinguish such series from any other series of preferred stock; (iii) to determine the number of shares in any such series (including a determination that such series shall consist of a single share); and (iv) to determine with respect to the shares of any series of preferred stock:

(b) whether, and if so to what extent and upon what terms and conditions, the holders thereof shall be entitled to rights upon the liquidation of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the Corporation;
(c) whether, and if so upon what terms and conditions, such shares shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, other securities or property;
(d) whether, and if so upon what terms and conditions, such shares shall be redeemable;
(e) whether the shares shall be subject to any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of such shares and, if so, the terms of such fund;
(f) whether the holders thereof shall be entitled to voting rights and, if so, the terms and conditions for the exercise thereof, provided that the holders of shares of preferred stock (i) will not be entitled to more than the lesser of (x) one vote per $100 of liquidation value or (y) one vote per share, when voting as a class with the holders of shares of capital stock, and (ii) will not be entitled to vote on any matter separately as a class, except, to the extent specified with respect to each series, (x) with respect to any amendment or alteration of the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation that would adversely affect the powers, preferences, or special rights of the applicable series of preferred stock or (y) in the event the Corporation fails to pay dividends on any series of preferred stock in full for any six quarterly dividend payment periods, whether or not consecutive, in which event the number of directors may be increased by two and the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock then similarly entitled shall be entitled to elect the two additional directors until full accumulated dividends on all such shares of preferred stock shall have been paid; and
(g) whether the holders thereof shall be entitled to other preferences or rights and, if so, the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of such preferences or rights.

:          The Board of Directors may designate from their number an executive committee and one or more other committees, each of which shall consist of three or more directors.  All such committees, in the intervals between meetings of the Board of Directors and to the extent provided in the By-laws or the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing such a committee, shall have all the authority and may exercise all the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation to the extent lawful under the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York.
SEVEN
The Board of Directors shall from time to time decide whether and to what extent and at what times and under what conditions and requirements the accounts and books of the Corporation, or any of them, except the stock book, shall be open to the inspection of the stockholders, and no stockholder shall have any right to
2

Directors shall be stockholders, subject to the power of the Board of Directors from time to time to prescribe a reasonable time after qualification within which newly elected directors must become stockholders.
Each director, in consideration of serving as such, shall be entitled to receive from the Corporation such amount per annum or such fees for attendance at meetings of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors or of committees of the Board of Directors, or both, as the Board of Directors shall from time to time determine, together with reimbursement for the reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the performance of duties.

(2) Any such director of the Corporation may be counted in determining the existence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof that shall authorize any such contract, transaction, or act, but may not vote thereon, and
(3) No director of the Corporation shall be liable to account to the Corporation for any profit realized by such director from or through any such contract, transaction, or act; provided, however, that if any such director of the Corporation is so interested either individually or as a member of a firm or association, or as the holder of a majority of the stock of any class of a corporation, the contract, transaction, or act shall be duly authorized or ratified by a majority of the Board of Directors who are not so interested and who know of such director's interest therein.
To the extent permitted by law, any contract, transaction, or act of the Corporation or of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof that shall be ratified, whether before or after judgment rendered in a suit with respect to such
3
contract, transaction, or act, by the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation having voting power at any annual meeting or at any special meeting called for such purpose, shall be as valid and as binding as though ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation and shall constitute a complete bar to any such suit or to any claim of execution in respect of any such judgment; provided, however, that any failure of the stockholders to approve or ratify such contract, transaction, or act, when and if submitted, shall not be deemed in any way to invalidate the same or to deprive the Corporation, its directors, officers, or employees of its or their right to proceed with such contract, transaction, or act.

NINE
               The holders of shares of the Corporation shall have no preemptive or preferential right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of the Corporation or any rights or options to purchase shares of the Corporation or any shares or other securities convertible into or carrying rights or options to purchase shares of the Corporation.
TEN:
