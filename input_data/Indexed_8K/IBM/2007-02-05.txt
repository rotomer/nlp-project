These options will be granted on May 8, 2007.  The actual number of options granted on this date will be determined by dividing the value shown above by a predetermined, formulaic Planning Price and the respective Black-Scholes option valuation factor.  The exercise price of these options will be the average high/low market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant.
