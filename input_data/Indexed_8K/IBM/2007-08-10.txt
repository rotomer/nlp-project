Agreements.
 
     (A)     
   
Each of the Issuer and the Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
 
(a)
  
The Issuer and the Company will file the Final Prospectus, properly completed, pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Issuer and the Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when any amendment to the Registration Statement relating to the Securities shall have become effective, (ii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice that would prevent its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (iv) of the receipt by the Company or the Issuer of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Issuer and the Company will each use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. Neither the Issuer nor the Company will file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Final Prospectus unless you have been furnished a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object.
 
(b)
  
If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Issuer and the Company will give the Representatives immediate notice of the occurrence of such event and promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance.
 
5
(c)
  
The Issuer will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the end of the 12-month period beginning at the end of the current fiscal quarter of the Company, an earning statement (which need not be audited) of the Company and its subsidiaries, covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the end of the current fiscal quarter of the Company, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 thereunder.
 
(d)
  
The Issuer will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.
 
(e)
  
The Issuer and the Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors.
 
(f)
  
Until the earlier of the day on which the distribution of the Securities is completed or the business day following the Closing Date, neither the Issuer nor the Company will, without the consent of the Representatives, offer or sell, or announce the offering of, any debt securities covered by the Registration Statement or any other registration statement filed under the Act.
 
(g)
  
The Issuer will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, in a form approved by you and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
 
(h)
  
If there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Issuer will notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented.
 
(i)
  
Each of the Issuer and the Company agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed with the Commission or retained under Rule 433, other than the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(g) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.  Each of the Issuer and the Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

Each Underwriter agrees to furnish the Issuer and the Company with a copy of each proposed Free Writing Prospectus to be prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter before its first use and not to use any Free Writing Prospectus, to which the Issuer or the Company reasonably objects, provided, however, that without consent of the Issuer and the Company, each Underwriter may use the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(A)(g) hereto and one or more preliminary term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information.
 
5.

person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day preceding such February 13, May 13, August 13 or November 13, as the case may be, unless the Company shall default in the payment of interest due on such interest payment date, in which case such defaulted interest, at the option of the Company, may be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest established by notice to the registered holders of Notes not less than ten days preceding such special record date or may be paid in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed.  Payment of interest may, at the option of the Company, be made by check mailed to the registered address of the person entitled thereto.
 
Interest on this Note will accrue from and including August 13, 2007, to but excluding the first interest payment date and then from and including the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the next interest payment date or maturity date, as the case may be (each such period an interest period). The amount of accrued interest that the Company will pay for any interest period will be calculated by multiplying the face amount of the Note by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from August 13, 2007, or from the last date interest was paid, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360.
 
The interest rate on the Notes will be calculated by the calculation agent appointed by the Company, initially The Bank of New York. The calculation agent will reset the interest rate on each interest payment date and on August 13, 2007 (each an interest reset date). The second London business day preceding an interest reset date will be the interest determination date for that interest reset date. The interest rate in effect on each day that is not an interest reset date will be the interest rate determined as of the interest determination date pertaining to the immediately preceding interest reset date. The interest rate in effect on any day that is an interest reset date will be the interest rate determined as of the interest determination date pertaining to that interest reset date.
 
Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof.  Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
 
This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by the Trustee under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.

This is one of the Securities of the
Series designated herein issued under
the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as Trustee
 
   by ______________________________
         Authorized Signatory
This security is one of a duly authorized issue of unsecured debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (hereinafter called the Securities), of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under an indenture (hereinafter called the Indenture) dated as of August 13 2007, duly executed and delivered by the Company to The Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation, as trustee (hereinafter called the Trustee), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights and duties thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Securities.  The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates, may have different conversion prices (if any), may be subject to different redemption provisions, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided.  This Security is one of a series designated as the Floating Rate Notes due 2009 of the Company (hereinafter called the Notes) issued under the Indenture.
 
LIBOR will be determined by the calculation agent in accordance with the following provisions.
 
With respect to any interest determination date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in United States dollars having a maturity of the Index Maturity commencing on the first day of the applicable interest period that appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that interest determination date. If no rate appears, LIBOR for that interest determination date will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in the following paragraph.
 
With respect to an interest determination date on which no rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, as specified in the paragraph above, the calculation agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the calculation agent (after consultation with the Company), to provide the calculation agent with its offered quotation for deposits in United States dollars for the Index Maturity, commencing on the first day of the applicable interest period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that interest determination date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on that interest determination date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on the interest determination date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in The City of New York, on the interest determination date by three major banks in The City of New York selected by the calculation agent (after consultation with the Company) for loans in United States dollars to leading European banks, having an Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time. If, however, the banks selected by the calculation agent are not providing quotations in the manner described by the previous sentence,
LIBOR determined as of that interest determination date will be LIBOR in effect on that interest determination date.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page means the display designated as the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, or such other screen as may replace the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page on the service or any successor service as may be nominated by the British Bankers Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for United States dollar deposits.
 
The Index Maturity will be three  months.
 
A London business day, is any day on which dealings in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.  A "Business Day" is any day except a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York or a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York. In the event that any interest payment date (other than the maturity date) and interest reset date would otherwise fall on a day that is not  a Business Day, that interest payment date and interest reset date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day. If the postponement would cause the day to fall in the next calendar month, the interest payment date and interest reset date will be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation of the interest rate on the Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward). Each calculation of the interest rate on the Notes by the calculation agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on  Holders   and the Company.
 
The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the Notes such additional amounts as are necessary in order that the net payment by the Company or a paying agent of the principal of and interest on the Notes to a holder who is not a United States person (as defined below), after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States, imposed by withholding with respect to the payment, will not be less than the amount provided in the Notes to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply:

(2)  to any holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion of the Notes, or that is a fiduciary or partnership, but only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, a beneficial owner or member of the partnership would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
 
(3)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise or withheld solely by reason of a failure of the holder or any other person to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(4)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding by the Company or a paying agent from the payment;
 
(5)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of a change in law, regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
 
(6)  to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(7)  to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or interest on any Notes, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent;
 
 
 
 
(8)  to any Notes where such withholding is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to European Union Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
 
(9)  to any Notes presented for payment by, or on behalf of, a holder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Notes to another paying agent in a member state of the European Union; or
 
(10)  in the case of any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9).
 
The Notes are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable to the Notes. Except as specifically provided in this Note, the Company shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of, or in any government or political subdivision.

If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States), or any change in, or amendments to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after August 8, 2007, the Company or the Guarantor becomes, or based upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by the Company, will become obligated to pay additional amounts as described above with respect to the Notes or in the Guarantee endorsed on the Notes, then the Company may at its option redeem, in whole, but not in part, the Notes on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with interest accrued but unpaid on those Notes to the date fixed for redemption.
