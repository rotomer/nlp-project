"IBM continued to perform well in a very difficult economic environment.  This was due to our long-term strategic focus: shifting into software and services, divesting of commodity businesses, and creating solutions that help clients reduce cost and conserve capital.  At the same time we have a disciplined approach to cost and expense management giving us a strong financial position," said Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer.
 
"We are well-positioned to continue to move aggressively and leverage our strong cash performance to make the most of the opportunities that arise, including smarter planet initiatives and other strategic options.  We remain ahead of pace for our 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 per share."
 
IBM said that it expects full-year 2009 earnings of at least $9.20 per share.
