ARMONK, N.Y., July 19, 2010 . . . IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced second-quarter 2010 diluted earnings of $2.61 per share compared with diluted earnings of $2.32 per share in the second quarter of 2009, an increase of 13 percent.
 
Second-quarter net income was $3.4 billion compared with $3.1 billion in the second quarter of 2009, an increase of 9 percent.  Total revenues for the second quarter of 2010 of $23.7 billion increased 2 percent (2 percent, adjusting for currency) from the second quarter of 2009.  The impact of changes in currency rates since IBM's first-quarter earnings report in April reduced revenue by approximately $500 million in the second quarter.
 
"In the second quarter we again delivered double-digit earnings-per-share growth, increased margins, as well as improving constant-currency revenue performance in our on going software, services and hardware businesses, and in all geographies," said Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer.
 
"With the benefit of our strategic growth investments, our mix of higher-value business and the introduction of new System z and Power Systems, we are confident of our ability in the second half of the year to continue our strong business performance, grow profit and drive shareholder returns.  As a result, we expect full-year 2010 diluted earnings per share of at least $11.25."
 
From a geographic perspective, the Americas' second-quarter revenues were $10.2 billion, an increase of 3 percent (2 percent, adjusting for currency) from the 2009 period.  Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa were $7.4 billion, down 6 percent (1 percent, adjusting for currency).  Asia-Pacific revenues increased 9 percent (3 percent, adjusting for currency) to $5.4 billion.  OEM revenues were $677 million, up 26 percent compared with the 2009 second quarter.  Revenues from the company's growth markets organization increased 14 percent (9 percent, adjusting for currency) and represented 20 percent of IBM's total geographic revenue in the quarter.  In the first half, revenue for the growth markets organization was as large as the total revenue of the Euro zone countries for the first time.
 
Total Global Services revenues increased 2 percent (1 percent, adjusting for currency). Global Technology Services segment revenues increased 1 percent (flat, adjusting for currency) to $9.2 billion.

Total Outsourcing services (GTS Outsourcing and Application Management Outsourcing) signings decreased 19 percent (19 percent, adjusting for currency) to $6.5 billion.
