Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date hereof is after the fifteenth calendar day preceding a January 5 or July 5, as the case may be, and before such January 5 or July 5, this Note shall bear interest from such January 5 or July 5; provided, however, that if the Company shall default in the payment of interest due on such January 5 or July 5, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding January 5 or July 5 to which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes, from December 9, 2010.  The interest so payable on January 5 or July 5 will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof, be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day preceding such January 5 or July 5, unless the Company shall default in the payment of interest due on such interest payment date, in which case such defaulted interest, at the option of the Company, may be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest established by notice to the registered holders of Notes not less than ten days preceding such special record date or may be paid in any other lawful manner not i nconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed.  Payment of interest may, at the option of the Company, be made by check mailed to the registered address of the person entitled thereto.  Interest on this Note will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof.  Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.

The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates, may have different conversion prices (if any), may be subject to different redemption provisions, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided.  This Security is one of a series designated as the 2.000% Notes due 2016 of the Company (hereinafter called the Notes) issued under the Indenture.
 
The Notes may be redeemed, as a whole or in part, at the Companys option, at any time or from time to time, upon mailing a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to holders of the Notes at their last registered addresses, all as provided in the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, as defined below, discounted, on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate, as defined below, plus 15 basis points, plus accrued interest to the date of redemptio n which has not been paid.
 
Treasury Rate means, with respect to any redemption date for the Notes: (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated H.15(519) or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities, for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that if no maturity is within three months before or after the maturity date for the Notes, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis rounding to the nearest month; or (ii) if that release, or any successor release, is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.

Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
Independent Investment Banker means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers, appointed by the Company.
 
Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any redemption date for the Notes: (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations; or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all quotations obtained by the Trustee.
 
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
 
Reference Treasury Dealer means each of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer (a Primary Treasury Dealer) the Company will substitute therefor another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
Remaining Scheduled Payments means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date.
 
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion thereof called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest. On or before the redemption date, the Company will deposit with a Paying Agent, or the Trustee, money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof together with interest accrued thereon, if any, may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
