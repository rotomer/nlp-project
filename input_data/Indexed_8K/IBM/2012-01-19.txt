ARMONK, N.Y., January 19, 2012 . . . IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced fourth-quarter 2011 diluted earnings of $4.62 per share, compared with diluted earnings of $4.18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 11 percent.    Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $4.71 per share, compared with operating diluted earnings of $4.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 11 percent.
 
Fourth-quarter net income was $5.5 billion compared with $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 4 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) net income was $5.6 billion compared with $5.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 5 percent.
 
Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $29.5 billion increased 2 percent (1 percent, adjusting for currency) from the fourth quarter of 2010.  While currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of approximately 25 basis points in the quarter, currency movements since the company announced its third-quarter earnings in October impacted fourth-quarter revenue by approximately one point of growth, or $300 million.
 
"We had a strong fourth-quarter performance, capping a year of record earnings per share, revenue, profit and free cash flow," said Ginni Rometty, IBM president and
chief executive officer.  "We delivered outstanding results in all four of our strategic initiatives for the quarter and the year, as we continued to realize the benefit of our long-term investments in growth markets, business analytics, Smarter Planet solutions and cloud.  We are well on track toward our long-term roadmap for operating earnings per share of at least $20 in 2015."
 
Fourth-Quarter GAAP - Operating (non-GAAP) Reconciliation
 
Fourth-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.09 per share of net charges: $0.10 per share for the amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, offset by ($0.01) per share for retirement-related items driven by changes to plan assets and liabilities primarily related to market performance.
 
Full-Year 2012 Expectation
 
IBM said that it expects to deliver full-year 2012 GAAP earnings per share of at least $14.16; and operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share of at least $14.85.
