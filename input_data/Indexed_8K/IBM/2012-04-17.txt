Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $2.78 per share, compared with operating diluted earnings of $2.41 per share in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 15 percent.

We delivered another excellent software performance, expanded services margins, and continued the momentum in our growth initiatives," said Ginni Rometty, IBM president and chief executive officer.  "Our investments in growth market countries continued to generate strong revenue growth across software, hardware and services while contributing to the company's ongoing margin expansion.
 
"Based on this performance, we are raising our 2012 full-year operating earnings per share expectations to at least $15.00."

Total expense and other income increased 3 percent to $7.3 billion compared with the prior-year period.  S,G&A expense of $5.9 billion increased 1 percent year over year.

IBM's tax rate was 20.1 percent, down 4.9 points year over year; operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was 20.6 percent, down 4.4 points.  The lower tax rate was due to a one-time benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America.  The benefit offset the company's first-quarter workforce rebalancing expense, similar to first-quarter 2011 when a one-time gain from asset sales offset workforce rebalancing expenses.  The company expects its full-year 2012 effective tax rate on a GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) basis to be in the range of 24 percent; and excluding the one-time benefit in the first quarter, the rate is expected to be in the range of 25 percent.

Debt, including Global Financing, totaled $32.1 billion, compared with $31.3 billion at year-end 2011.  From a management segment view, Global Financing debt totaled $23.6 billion versus $23.3 billion at year-end 2011, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 7.0 to 1.  Non-global financing debt totaled $8.5 billion, an increase of $469 million since year-end 2011, resulting in a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32.7 percent from 32.0 percent.
 
IBM ended the first-quarter 2012 with $12.3 billion of cash on hand and generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion, excluding Global Financing receivables, up approximately $1.1 billion year over year.  The company returned $3.9 billion to shareholders through $0.9 billion in dividends and $3.0 billion of share repurchases.  The balance sheet remains strong, and the company is well positioned to support the business over the long term.
