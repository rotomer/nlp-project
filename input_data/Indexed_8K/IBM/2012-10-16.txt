ARMONK, N.Y., October 16, 2012 . . . IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced third-quarter 2012 diluted earnings of $3.33 per share, a year-to-year increase of 4 percent, or $3.44 per share, up 8 percent excluding the impact of UK pension-related charges.  Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $3.62 per share, compared with operating diluted earnings of $3.28 per share in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 10 percent.
 
Third-quarter net income was $3.8 billion, flat year-to-year; or $3.9 billion, up 3 percent excluding the impact of UK pension-related charges.  Operating (non-GAAP) net income was $4.2 billion compared with $4.0 billion in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 5 percent.
 
Total revenues for the third quarter of 2012 of $24.7 billion were down 5 percent (down 2 percent, adjusting for currency) from the third quarter of 2011.  Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by nearly $1 billion.
 
"In the third quarter, we continued to drive margin, profit and earnings growth through our focus on higher-value businesses, strategic growth initiatives and productivity," said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer.
 
"Looking ahead, we see good opportunity with a strong product lineup heading into this quarter and annuity businesses that provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash.  We are reiterating our full-year 2012 operating earnings per share expectation of at least $15.10."
 
Third-Quarter GAAP  Operating (non-GAAP) Reconciliation

Full-Year 2012 Expectations
 
IBM is adjusting its expectation for full-year 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share to at least $14.29, to reflect the impact of UK pension-related charges.
