Item 5.02(e) (Compensatory Arrangements of Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer)
 
On October 30, 2012, the IBM Board of Directors approved compensatory arrangements for Virginia M. Rometty, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mrs. Rometty's base salary will remain $1.5 million.  Her 2012 Annual Incentive Target was increased from $3.5 million to $4 million, prorated effective October 1, 2012, the date Mrs. Rometty became Chairman of the IBM Board of Directors.  Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a 2013 long-term incentive award of $12 million for Mrs. Rometty, comprised of 2013-2015 Performance Share Units (PSUs).  These PSUs will be granted on January 2, 2013.  The actual number of units granted on this date will be determined by dividing the PSU value ($12 million) by a predetermined, formulaic planning price for the first quarter 2013.  These PSUs will be paid out in February 2016. Information regarding the structure of IBM's compensation programs and awards is included in the Company's proxy statement.
