Exhibit 99.1
(May 2, 2006) IntercontinentalExchange (NYSE: ICE) today reported first quarter 2006 consolidated revenues of $50.3 million, an increase of 58.0% from $31.8 million in the first quarter of 2005. In the quarter ending March 31, 2006, consolidated net income totaled $19.7 million, for an increase of 121.7% over the $8.9 million earned in the first quarter of 2005. First quarter 2006 consolidated operating income was $27.7 million, up 122.9% compared to $12.4 million in the same period in 2005, resulting in an operating margin of 55.0%. Consolidated revenues, operating margin and net income represent record results, which were driven by strong growth in quarterly trading volume.
ATLANTA, GA
Average daily volume for ICE Futures, the company's futures business segment, in the first quarter of 2006 rose 81.7% to 260,304 contracts, compared to 143,270 contracts per day in the first quarter of 2005, marking ICE Futures' highest volume quarter to date. Excluding the new WTI Crude futures contract introduced February 3, futures volume in the quarter increased 64.1%. Also in the first quarter, average daily commissions for ICE's over-the-counter (OTC) segment increased 58.2% to $380,548, compared to $240,473 per day in the first quarter of 2005. Average daily commissions reflect daily trading activity in the company's OTC markets.
"We have just wrapped up our best quarter to date as we continue the successful implementation of our strategy for 2006. The growth in our business and excellent financial performance position us to compete aggressively in the rapidly expanding energy marketplace," said ICE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher. "In the first quarter, we successfully introduced our electronically traded ICE WTI Crude futures contract as a complement to our ICE Brent Crude futures contract, as well as a number of important cleared OTC contracts in the North American natural gas and power market. By offering this broad range of globally traded energy products on an integrated platform, ICE continues to be the largest and fastest growing electronic energy marketplace."
Sprecher added: "We continue to see strong interest in our markets and risk management tools by new and existing energy market participants. We're employing our technology and new product development to drive growth across our business lines. In the second quarter, we'll introduce additional new products as well as enhancements to our trading platform as we expand our market-leading energy offering to market participants around the globe."

First-Quarter Results
In the first quarter of 2006, the company's consolidated revenues rose 58.0% to $50.3 million, compared to $31.8 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2005. Consolidated transaction fee revenues increased 59.6% to $43.2 million from $27.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Growth was driven by a combination of volume increases in both the OTC and futures business segments during the quarter and the entry of new participants in the company's OTC and futures markets.
Transaction fee revenues at ICE Futures totaled $19.0 million, an increase of 57.2% over $12.1 million in the same period in the prior year as the expansion of ICE Futures markets continued following its transition to electronic trading in April of 2005. ICE Futures maintained a fee waiver on its ICE WTI Crude futures contract through March 31, 2006.
In the first quarter of 2006, transaction fee revenues in the OTC business segment increased 61.6% to $24.3 million compared to $15.0 million in the same period in 2005. Contract volume in ICE's cleared OTC markets rose 110.1% to 15.8 million contracts in the first quarter compared to 7.5 million contracts in the same period of 2005.
Consolidated market data fee revenues, through the ICE Data business segment, increased 72.9% during the first quarter of 2006 to $6.0 million compared to $3.5 million in the same period in 2005.
Consolidated operating expenses during the first quarter of 2006 increased 16.5% to $22.6 million compared to $19.4 million in the same period in 2005, reflecting the company's adoption of SFAS 123R as of January 1, 2006. Stock-based non-cash compensation expense increased to $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $0.4 million in the same period of 2005.
First quarter 2006 consolidated operating income was $27.7 million, up 122.9% compared to $12.4 million in the same period in 2005. This produced an operating margin of 55.0% for the first quarter of 2006 compared to an operating margin of 39.0% for the same period in 2005. Consolidated net income in the first quarter of 2006 was $19.7 million, up 121.7% compared to $8.9 million in the same period in 2005.
Consolidated cash flows from operations were $17.1 million in the first quarter of 2006, up 105.2% from $8.3 million in the same period in the prior year. Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2006 totaled $1.9 million compared to $0.2 million in the same period of 2005. The increase in capital expenditures primarily relates to hardware purchases to enhance the electronic trading platform. Capitalized software development costs totaled $1.5 million in the first quarter, up modestly from $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2005. Unrestricted cash and investments were $150.7 million as of March 31, 2006, compared to $133.5 million as of December 31, 2005. The company ended the first quarter with no long-term debt.
