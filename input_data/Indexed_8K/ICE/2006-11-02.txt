ICE reported consolidated revenues of $94.7 million, a 109.2% increase compared to the third quarter of 2005. Consolidated operating income rose to $65.4 million, a 163.0% increase compared to the third quarter of 2005, and produced an operating margin of 69.1%. Third quarter 2006 consolidated net income rose 159.5% over the prior third quarter to $43.6 million, and diluted earnings per share in the third quarter were $0.73.
ATLANTA, GA
Average daily volume (ADV) for ICE Futures, the company's futures business segment, in the third quarter of 2006 increased 125.1% to 412,993 contracts, compared to ADV of 183,481 contracts in the third quarter of 2005. Average daily commissions for ICE's over-the-counter (OTC) segment for the third quarter of 2006 increased 95.3% to $737,967 compared to $377,815 per day in the third quarter of 2005. Average daily commissions reflect daily trading activity in the company's OTC markets.
"These record results demonstrate ICE's continued leadership in the electronic energy markets across futures and OTC segments. Market participants are increasingly relying on our global energy markets for their hedging and risk management needs. We continue to expand our products and technology platform to meet the demand for access to our liquid and transparent markets," said ICE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher. "In addition to producing exceptional growth, our expanding operating margins reflect our strong commitment to financial discipline."
"We are moving forward under our agreement reached in September to acquire the New York Board of Trade, and look forward to joining together with this very highly respected
     1
 
U.S. futures exchange to form a leading global commodity marketplace," Sprecher continued. "We are pleased with the progress on the acquisition to date, and we believe that the merger between ICE and NYBOT will create a winning combination for customers and stakeholders."
For the third quarter of 2006, ICE's consolidated revenues were $94.7 million, an increase of 109.2% compared to $45.2 million in revenues in the third quarter of 2005, and a 28.6% increase compared to the second quarter of 2006. Consolidated transaction revenues totaled $83.9 million, for an increase of 106.4% compared to $40.7 million in the third quarter of 2005. Transaction revenues accounted for 88.7% of consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2006. Consolidated market data revenues increased 161.5% to $9.7 million, compared to the prior year's third quarter market data revenues of $3.7 million following a revision to market data pricing earlier this year. Approximately 58% of ICE's third quarter revenues were derived from North America.
Third-Quarter Results
Third quarter 2006 transaction revenues in ICE's OTC business segment increased 89.9% to $46.7 million compared to $24.6 million in the third quarter of 2005. Contract volume in ICE's cleared OTC markets increased 144.1% to a record 37.1 million contracts in the third quarter, compared to 15.2 million contracts in the same period of 2005. ICE introduced 13 new cleared OTC contracts during the third quarter, following the launch of 43 cleared contracts in the first half of 2006, bringing ICE's total cleared OTC contracts to more than 80 products. Revenue generated by the new cleared OTC contracts introduced in 2006 accounted for $2.1 million of OTC transaction revenue in the third quarter of 2006. The OTC business segment accounted for 55.7% of third quarter 2006 consolidated transaction revenues.
Transaction revenues for ICE's futures segment totaled $37.2 million, an increase of 131.8% over futures transaction revenues of $16.0 million in the third quarter last year. Growth was driven by strong increases in contract volume, a price adjustment in the second quarter, as well as new contracts and new participants in ICE Futures' regulated electronic markets. The futures segment accounted for 44.3% of third quarter 2006 consolidated transaction revenues.
Consolidated operating expenses during the third quarter of 2006 totaled $29.3 million, an increase of 43.6% compared to $20.4 million for the third quarter of 2005. The primary increase in third quarter 2006 expenses resulted from an increase in patent royalty payments relating to futures as contract volume rose. In the third quarter of 2006, royalty payments and accruals totaled $3.2 million compared to $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2005. The Wagner patent will expire in February 2007, and ICE's royalty payments and expenses will cease at that time. In addition, the non-cash compensation costs relating to ICE's adoption on January 1, 2006 of SFAS 123R resulted in a stock-based non-cash compensation expense of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2006 compared to $0.4 million in the same period of 2005.
Third quarter 2006 consolidated operating income was $65.4 million, an increase of 163.0% compared to $24.9 million in the prior year's third quarter. Operating margin in the third quarter of 2006 was 69.1%, a substantial increase from 54.9% in last year's third quarter.
Consolidated net income in the third quarter of 2006 was $43.6 million, an increase of 159.5% compared to net income of $16.8 million for the third quarter of 2005. Diluted

earnings per share were $0.73 in the third quarter of 2006, which was based on 59.6 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
Consolidated cash flows from operations were $45.4 million in the third quarter of 2006 compared to $13.3 million in the same period in the prior year. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2006 totaled $4.0 million, which was flat compared to the third quarter of 2005. Capitalized software development costs totaled $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $1.4 million in the same period in the prior year. Unrestricted cash and investments were $248.2 million as of September 30, 2006, compared to $133.5 million as of December 31, 2005. ICE ended the third quarter with no debt.
