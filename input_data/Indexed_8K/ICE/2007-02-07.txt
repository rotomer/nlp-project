(February 7, 2007) IntercontinentalExchange (NYSE: ICE) reported record quarterly consolidated net income for the fourth quarter 2006 of $49.0 million, more than tripling its year-on-year quarterly earnings compared to $14.9 million in net income in the fourth quarter of 2005. Consolidated revenues in the quarter increased 131% to a record $95.3 million, from $41.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $0.81.
ATLANTA, GA
For the year ended December 31, 2006, ICE reported a 101% rise in consolidated revenues to a record $313.8 million compared with $155.9 million in the prior year. Consolidated net income increased 255% to a record $143.3 million from $40.4 million in 2005. ICE Futures, ICE's U.K.-regulated futures business segment, recorded its ninth consecutive record volume year and produced an average daily volume (ADV) increase of 125% over 2005. Average daily commissions in 2006 increased 89% in ICE's over-the-counter (OTC) business segment over last year. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.40.
"We believe the strong foundation we built in our first year as a public company, while doubling our revenues and more than tripling our net income, will serve our expansion plans in the new year," said ICE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher. "By capitalizing on the proliferation of electronic trading in the global commodity markets and the opportunities for trading and risk management it creates, we are leveraging our robust technology and broad distribution to meet the needs of the trading community."
Sprecher added, "Already this year, by completing our acquisition of the New York Board of Trade and successfully launching the soft commodity contracts on the ICE platform, we are executing on the strategic opportunities before us. These include clearing opportunities, new products and partnerships, technology enhancements and other initiatives to leverage the strengths of our global business and commodities trading platform."

In the fourth quarter of 2006, ICE's consolidated revenues rose to $95.3 million, an increase of 131% over $41.3 million of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2005. Consolidated transaction fee revenues increased 129% to $82.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, from $36.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Growth in transaction revenue was driven primarily by the strength in trading volume in both the futures and OTC business segments during the quarter, and by new participants in ICE's markets.
Fourth-Quarter Results
Transaction fee revenues at ICE Futures totaled $37.7 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 148% over $15.2 million in the same period in 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2006, ADV for ICE Futures rose 145% to 440,557 contracts, compared to 180,171 contracts in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increased adoption of electronic trading in the global energy futures markets and the introduction and solid performance of the ICE WTI Crude futures contract contributed to the strong growth in futures volume.
Fourth quarter transaction fee revenues in the OTC business segment increased 115% to $45.1 million, compared to $21.0 million in the same period in 2005. OTC transaction fee revenues from cleared products increased 133% to $37.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $16.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Contract volume in ICE's cleared OTC markets rose 130% to 32.7 million contracts in the fourth quarter, compared to 14.2 million contracts in the same period of 2005. OTC average daily commissions in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 114% to $712,191, compared to $332,045 in the same period the prior year. In ICE's OTC business segment, average daily commissions reflect daily trading activity in ICE's OTC markets.
Consolidated market data fee revenues in the market data business segment increased 143% during the fourth quarter of 2006 to $9.6 million compared to $4.0 million in the same period in 2005.
Consolidated other revenues increased 158% during the fourth quarter to $2.8 million from $1.1 million in the same period in 2005. This increase was due primarily to the inception of a program to charge certain system fees, totaling $1.5 million. ICE invoiced the fees related to the full year of 2006 during the fourth quarter. Going forward, ICE will invoice these fees on a quarterly basis.
Consolidated operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $31.1 million, an increase of 53% compared to $20.4 million in the same period of 2005. The primary driver for the increase was a 374% rise in patent royalty expenses relating to the Wagner patent as a result of the strong growth in futures volume. The patent royalty expense, which is tied to the trading volume of electronic futures contracts, totaled $2.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $0.6 million in the same period in 2005. The Wagner patent expires on February 20, 2007, at which time no further payments will be required. ICE also recorded a 406% increase in non-cash compensation expenses following the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. The non-cash compensation expense was $2.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $0.4 million in the same period in 2005.
Fourth quarter 2006 consolidated operating income was $64.2 million, up 207% compared to $20.9 million in the same period in 2005. This produced an operating margin of 67% for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to an operating margin of 51% for the same period in 2005.

The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 27.3%, as compared to 31.9% for the fourth quarter of 2005. ICE reduced its income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of its decision to reinvest undistributed overseas earnings of approximately $50 million. This plan resulted in a reduction of consolidated income tax expense of approximately $4.8 million.
Consolidated net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $49.0 million, up 230% compared to $14.9 million in the same period in 2005.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, consolidated revenues increased 101% to $313.8 million compared to $155.9 million in 2005. Consolidated transaction fee revenues grew 100% to $273.6 million, from $137.0 million in 2005. Futures transaction fee revenues rose 116% in 2006, to $123.4 million, from $57.2 million in 2005, and OTC transaction fee revenues increased 88%, to $150.2 million, from $79.8 million in 2005.
Full-Year Results
Volume at ICE Futures for 2006 set a record for a ninth consecutive year, reaching 92.7 million contracts, up 121% over volume of 42.1 million contracts in 2005. ADV in the futures business segment for 2006 was 373,248 contracts, compared to 166,225 contracts in 2005.
In 2006, average daily commissions in the OTC business segment were $589,281, an 89% increase over $311,579 in the prior year. ICE introduced more than 50 new cleared OTC contracts throughout 2006, bringing the total number of cleared OTC products available on the ICE platform to over 80 contracts.
Consolidated market data revenues increased 134% to $34.2 million in 2006, from $14.6 million in 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, ICE implemented a fee increase that contributed to the higher consolidated market data revenues.
Consolidated other revenues increased 40% to $5.9 million in 2006, from $4.2 million in 2005, primarily due to trade registration system fees.
Consolidated operating expenses in 2006 were $109.2 million, an increase of 10%, compared to $99.7 million in 2005 operating expenses. The increase is attributable primarily to a rise in non-cash compensation following the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) and an increase in the compensation and benefits expenses due to higher discretionary bonus payments in 2006 and a higher employee headcount. At the end of 2006, ICE had 226 employees compared to 203 employees at the end of 2005. The increase in operating expense was also driven by a $7.5 million rise in fees paid under the licensing of the Wagner patent. The 2005 operating expenses included $4.8 million for costs associated with the April closing of the ICE Futures open-outcry trading floor and $15.0 million in legal settlement costs, which partially off-set the increase in operating expenses in 2006.
For fiscal 2006, consolidated net income grew 255% to $143.3 million in 2006, compared to $40.4 million in the prior year.
Consolidated cash flows from operations were $145.9 million in 2006, up 193% from $49.8 million in 2005. Capital expenditures in 2006 totaled $12.4 million compared to $8.6 million in 2005. The increase in 2006 capital expenditures primarily related to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of the electronic

platform. Capitalized software development costs totaled $7.4 million in 2006, up from $5.1 million in 2005. Unrestricted cash and investments were $281.6 million as of December 31, 2006. ICE used approximately $165 million of its unrestricted cash to pay merger expenses and a portion of the merger consideration for the acquisition of NYBOT on January 12, 2007.
