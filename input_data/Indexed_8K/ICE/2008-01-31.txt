(January 31, 2008)  IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading operator of global exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) markets, reported consolidated net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 of $64.7 million, a 32% increase compared to $49.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the fourth quarter were $0.90, an increase of 11% over the prior year's fourth quarter of $0.81. Fourth quarter net income and EPS were reduced by $3.0 million and $0.04 per share due to certain non-cash compensation expense related to ICE's performance-based equity program and recorded under an accelerated method of expense recognition. Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter increased 67% to a record $159.3 million, from $95.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. This marks ICE's eighth consecutive quarter of record revenues.

for ICE's OTC segment during 2007 increased to a record $845,572, a 44% increase over 2006. For businesses acquired last year, 2007 volume and commission levels reflect only the time period after the closing date of each transaction. ICE Futures U.S., formerly the New York Board of Trade, was acquired on January 12, and ICE Futures Canada, formerly the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, was acquired on August 28.
"By continuing to transform and diversify our global marketplace, we achieved record results for the fourth quarter and for 2007," said Jeffrey C. Sprecher, ICE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "The ICE team delivered on many key initiatives over the last year, including completing and integrating five acquisitions as well as a comprehensive redevelopment of our technology platform. This year is also off to a very strong start, including record levels of OTC commissions and futures volume in January, as well as a record number of participants on the ICE platform. We are busy pursuing a range of new opportunities while executing on the many initiatives that we began last year to drive both near-term and long-term growth."
Sprecher continued: "Among these initiatives are introducing our European clearing house, growing our equity index business through our exclusive Russell license and expanding the valuable futures and OTC businesses we acquired last year. Importantly, we continue to see organic growth in our core energy futures and OTC businesses. We maintain our focus on innovation and growth by being responsive to our customers' evolving needs, entering new markets, advancing our technology, and continuing our strategic approach to M&A."
ICE's fourth quarter 2007 consolidated revenues increased 67% to $159.3 million compared to $95.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Consolidated transaction fee revenues increased 60% to $132.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, from $82.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase in transaction revenue was driven primarily by the addition of ICE Futures U.S. and implementation of electronic trading in its markets, new products, strong trading volume in the futures and global OTC business segments, and the entry of new participants in ICE's markets.
Fourth Quarter 2007 Results
Transaction fee revenues in ICE's futures business segment, comprising ICE Futures Europe, ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada, totaled $72.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 92% over $37.7 million in the same period in 2006.

ADV for ICE Futures U.S. was 201,640 contracts in the fourth quarter of 2007, a 26% increase compared to the same period in 2006.

Consolidated market data fee revenues in the market data business segment increased 142% during the fourth quarter of 2007 to $23.3 million compared to $9.6 million in the same period in 2006. Consolidated other revenues increased $0.6 million during the fourth quarter to $3.4 million from $2.8 million in the same period in 2006.
Consolidated operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $62.8 million, an increase of 102% compared to $31.1 million in the same period of 2006. This increase is primarily attributable to $13.6 million in ICE Futures U.S. operating expenses and $1.9 million in amortization expenses on the ICE Futures U.S. intangibles. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2007, as a result of the company's achievements relative to annual performance targets as well as increased headcount compared to the prior fourth quarter, the company recorded increased cash and non-cash compensation expenses, primarily relating to performance-based compensation. Non-cash compensation for the quarter was $10.9 million, compared to $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, including an incremental $4.4 million recorded under an accelerated method of expense recognition rather than a straight-line approach, which tracks the actual vesting of those awards for employees. Expenses relating to the establishment of ICE Clear Europe were $1.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2007, in line with earlier guidance.
Fourth quarter 2007 consolidated operating income was $96.5 million, up 50% compared to $64.2 million in the same period in 2006. Operating margin was 61% for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to 67% for the same period in 2006 as a result of the acquisition of ICE Futures U.S. and increased non-cash compensation expense.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 32.7%, compared to 27.3% for the fourth quarter of 2006.
For the year ended December 31, 2007, consolidated revenues increased 83% to $574.3 million compared to $313.8 million in revenues in 2006. Consolidated transaction fee revenues increased 79% to $490.4 million in 2007, from $273.6 million in 2006.

Transaction fee revenues in ICE's futures business segment more than doubled in 2007, totaling $278.6 million, an increase of 126% over $123.4 million in 2006. Transaction fees earned on energy futures and option contracts, which trade through ICE Futures Europe, increased $55.5 million, or 45%, to $178.9 million in 2007 compared to $123.4 million in 2006.

to ICE's acquisition on August 28, ICE Futures Canada volume reached a record 3.5 million contracts.
Consolidated market data revenues increased 106% in 2007 to $70.4 million compared to $34.2 million in 2006. Consolidated other revenues increased $7.6 million to $13.5 million in 2007 from $5.9 million in the prior year.
Consolidated operating expenses for 2007 were $220.7 million, an increase of 102% compared to $109.2 million in 2006. This increase is primarily attributable to $55.7 million in ICE Futures U.S. operating expenses and $8.2 million in amortization expenses on the ICE Futures U.S. intangibles. The company recorded increased compensation expenses due to higher non-cash compensation expenses recognized under SFAS No. 123(R), higher cash compensation as a result of the company's achievements relative to annual performance targets, as well as increased headcount relative to 2006. Non-cash compensation expense was $23.6 million in 2007, compared to $8.8 million in the prior year. Expenses relating to the development of ICE Clear Europe totaled $4.5 million in 2007.
For fiscal 2007, consolidated net income grew 68% to $240.6 million, compared to $143.3 million in the prior year.

Unrestricted cash and investments were $260.6 million as of December 31, 2007. At the end of the year, the company had $221.9 million in debt as a result of the acquisition of ICE Futures U.S., which was completed on January 12, 2007.
