EARNINGS RELEASE
(May 2, 2008)  IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading operator of global exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) markets, reported record consolidated net income for the first quarter of 2008 of $92.3 million, a 66% increase compared to $55.6 million for the first quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the first quarter were $1.29, an increase of 61% over the prior year's first quarter of $0.80. Consistent with prior guidance, first quarter EPS was reduced by $0.02 per share due to costs associated with the closure of the futures pits at ICE Futures U.S.. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 64% to a record $207.2 million, from $126.6 million in the first quarter of 2007. This marks ICE's ninth consecutive quarter of record revenues.

"ICE's record first quarter is a result of our strategy to serve the rising demand for commodity price transparency, which enables efficient markets, hedging and risk management," said Jeffrey C. Sprecher, ICE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We have numerous initiatives underway to support growth across new and existing asset classes. Our organic growth remains strong despite the broader credit market issues over the past three quarters, and we have experienced record transaction volume in our markets this year. We look forward to the launch
1
 
of our European clearing house, which will further enhance credit intermediation in ICE's markets and beyond."
Sprecher continued: "We have been very focused on entering the equity index business and facilitating the transition of the Russell Index futures to ICE. Usage of Russell's U.S. indexes is at an all-time high, demonstrating the strong value in the Russell franchise and illustrating its potential impact to our business as exclusive trading of Russell equity futures products begins on ICE this fall. With the fastest matching engine in the futures markets today, we are continuing to offer additional user benefits through our extensive and ongoing technology enhancements. Finally, we continue to evaluate a range of M&A opportunities to expand our position as one of the most diversified and global derivatives markets in the world."
First Quarter 2008 Results
ICE's first quarter 2008 consolidated revenues increased 64% to $207.2 million compared to $126.6 million in the first quarter of 2007. Consolidated transaction revenues increased 62% to $177.4 million in the first quarter of 2008, from $109.3 million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase in transaction revenue was driven primarily by new products, strong trading volume in our futures and global OTC segments, and the entry of new participants in ICE's markets.
Transaction revenues in ICE's futures segment, comprising ICE Futures Europe, ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada, totaled $97.4 million in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 57% over $62.1 million in the same period in 2007.
In the first quarter of 2008, ICE Futures Europe recorded volume of 38.8 million contracts. ADV for ICE's European futures business rose to a record 616,150 contracts, an increase of 16% compared to the first quarter of 2007. The average rate per contract (RPC) for ICE Futures Europe in the first quarter was $1.25. ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada recorded first quarter volume of 22.6 million contracts and 1.1 million contracts, respectively. ADV for ICE Futures U.S. was a record 370,372 contracts in the first quarter of 2008, a 79% increase compared to the same period in 2007. ADV for ICE Futures Canada was a record 18,190 contracts during the quarter, a 45% increase compared to the year-ago period. First quarter RPC for ICE Futures U.S. agricultural futures and options contracts was $2.14.
First quarter 2008 transaction revenues in the global OTC segment increased 69% to $80.0 million, compared to $47.3 million in the same period in 2007. Average daily commissions increased 70% to a record $1,280,223, compared to $754,499 in the first quarter of 2007. Average daily commissions reflect daily trading activity in ICE's OTC markets. Cleared contracts accounted for 89% of OTC contract volume during the first quarter of 2008.
Consolidated market data revenues increased 76% during the first quarter of 2008 to $24.7 million compared to $14.0 million in the same period in 2007. Consolidated other revenues increased $1.8 million during the first quarter to $5.1 million from $3.2 million in the same period in 2007.
Consolidated operating expenses for the first quarter of 2008 were $62.9 million, an increase of 34% compared to $47.0 million in the same period of 2007. This rise is primarily attributable to increased depreciation and amortization expenses recorded on fixed and intangible asset additions associated with acquisitions, increased non-cash compensation expenses, severance costs due to the closure of the futures pits at ICE Futures U.S., and professional services expenses relating to the establishment of ICE Clear Europe. Amortization expenses on acquired intangibles were $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2008 compared to $1.9 million in the same
2
 
period of 2007. Floor closure costs during the first quarter, which primarily related to severance costs, were $2.1 million, reducing reported EPS for the quarter by $0.02 per share. Non-cash compensation for the quarter was $7.9 million, compared to $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2007. Expenses relating to the establishment of ICE Clear Europe were in line with guidance at $2.3 million during the first quarter of 2008, compared to $0.5 million in the first quarter of the prior year.
First quarter 2008 consolidated operating income was $144.3 million, up 81% compared to $79.6 million in the first quarter of 2007. Operating margin was 70% for the first quarter of 2008, compared to 63% for the same period in 2007.
Other income decreased $8.8 million year-to-year, primarily due to a $9.3 million gain recognized for the completed sale of our UK disaster recovery in the first quarter of 2007.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2008 was 35.2% compared to 36.7% for the first quarter of 2007.
