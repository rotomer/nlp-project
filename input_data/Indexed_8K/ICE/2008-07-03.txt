Item 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT
On June 27, 2008, IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. ("ICE") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and the lenders named therein ("Lenders"). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000 (the "Credit Facility"), which may be increased to $200,000,000 at the request of ICE and upon the agreement of the Lenders. In connection with the launch of clearing at ICE Clear Europe, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE, ICE will use any proceeds that it draws down from the Credit Facility to provide liquidity for the clearing operations of ICE Clear Europe.
Loans under Credit Facility shall, at the option of ICE, bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate or (ii) a "base rate" plus an applicable margin rate. The "base rate" will be equal to the higher of (i) Wachovia Bank's prime rate or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%. The applicable margin rate will be based on ICE's total leverage ratio. Interest on each loan is payable quarterly, or for LIBOR loans, at the option of ICE, on a one, two, three or six-month period. The term for the Credit Facility is 364 days following the closing date, which was June 27, 2008. With limited exceptions, ICE may prepay the outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty upon written notice to the Administrative Agent.
The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, leverage and interest coverage ratios, as well as limitations or required approvals when the leverage ratio is greater than 1.5 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis for acquisitions, dispositions of assets and certain investments; the incurrence of additional debt; or the creation of liens and other fundamental changes to ICE's business.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement contained in this Item 2.03 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

In the event of any such reduction affecting any Lender, if from time to time thereafter the amount of interest payable for the account of such Lender on any interest payment date would be less than the maximum amount permitted by applicable law to be charged by such Lender, then the amount of interest payable for its account on such subsequent interest payment date shall be automatically increased to such maximum permissible amount, that at no time shall the aggregate amount by which interest paid for the account of any Lender has been increased pursuant to this sentence exceed the aggregate amount by which interest paid for its account has theretofore been reduced pursuant to the previous sentence.

Method of Payments; Computations; Apportionment of Payments.
     (a) All payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, in Dollars and in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders entitled to such payment or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be (except as otherwise expressly provided herein as to payments required to be made directly to the Lenders) at the Payment Office prior to 12:00 noon, Charlotte time, on the date payment is due. Any payment made as required hereinabove, but after 12:00 noon, Charlotte time, shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment falls due on a day that is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (except that in the case of LIBOR Loans to which the provisions of are applicable, such due date shall be the next preceding Business Day), and such extension of time shall then be included in the computation of payment of interest, fees or other applicable amounts.
Section 2.10(iv)
     (b) The Administrative Agent will distribute to the Lenders like amounts relating to payments made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders as follows: (i) if the payment is received by 12:00 noon, Charlotte time, in immediately available funds, the Administrative Agent will make available to each relevant Lender on the same date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such Lender's ratable share of such payment (based on the percentage that the amount of the relevant payment owing to such Lender bears to the total amount of such payment owing to all of the relevant Lenders), and (ii) if such payment is received after 12:00 noon, Charlotte time, or in other than immediately available funds, the Administrative Agent will make available to each such Lender its ratable share of such payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the next succeeding Business Day (or in the case of uncollected funds, as soon as practicable after collected). If the Administrative Agent shall not have made a required distribution to the appropriate Lenders as required hereinabove after receiving a payment for the account of such Lenders, the Administrative Agent will pay to each such Lender, on demand, its ratable share of such payment with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount was required to be disbursed by the Administrative Agent until the date repaid to such Lender.
     (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
     (d) All computations of interest and fees hereunder (including computations of the Reserve Requirement) shall be made on the basis of a year consisting of (i) in the case of interest on Base Rate Loans, 365/366 days, as the case may be, or (ii) in all other instances, 360 days; and in each case under (i) and (ii) above, with regard to the actual number of days (including the first day, but excluding the last day) elapsed.
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document to the contrary, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender after acceleration of the Loans pursuant to shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as follows:

first
     (ii) , to the payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Credit Document;
second
     (iii) , to the payment of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees irrespective of whether such fees are allowed as a claim after the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event) of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Obligations owing to such Lender;
third
     (iv) , to the payment of all of the Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest (including, without limitation, fees incurred and interest accruing at the then applicable rate after the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event irrespective of whether a claim for such fees incurred and interest accruing is allowed in such proceeding);
fourth
     (v) , to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations;
fifth
     (vi) , to the payment of all other Obligations and other obligations that shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents and not repaid; and
sixth
     (vii) , to the payment of the surplus (if any) to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, (x) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category, and (y) all amounts shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the amounts of such principal, interest, fees or other Obligations owed to them respectively pursuant to clauses (iii) through (vii) above.
 
     2.13
Recovery of Payments.
     (a) The Borrower agrees that to the extent the Borrower makes a payment or payments to or for the account of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or any Lender, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar state or federal law, common law or equitable cause (whether as a result of any demand, settlement, litigation or otherwise), then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Obligation intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been received.
     (b) If any amounts distributed by the Administrative Agent to any Lender are subsequently returned or repaid by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, its representative or successor in interest, or any other Person, whether by court order, by settlement approved by the Lender in question, or pursuant to applicable Requirements of Law, such Lender will, promptly upon receipt of notice thereof from the Administrative Agent, pay the Administrative Agent such amount. If any such amounts are recovered by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower, its representative or successor in interest or such other Person, the Administrative Agent will redistribute such amounts to the Lenders on the same basis as such amounts were originally distributed.
     2.14
Pro Rata Treatment.
     (a) Except in the case of Swingline Loans, all fundings, continuations and conversions of Loans shall be made by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their respective Commitments to provide Loans (in the case of the funding of Loans pursuant to ) or on the basis of their respective outstanding Loans (in the case of continuations and conversions of Loans pursuant to , or in the event the Commitments have expired or have been terminated), as the case may be from time to time. All payments on account of principal of or interest on any Loans, fees or any other Obligations owing to or for the account of any one or more Lenders shall be apportioned ratably among such Lenders in proportion to the amounts of such principal, interest, fees or other Obligations owed to them respectively.
Section 2.2
Section 2.11
     (b) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other Obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such Obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any
provided
 
payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

     (ii) subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any LIBOR Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or

     (iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by such Lender or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
     (b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
 
to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
     (c) A certificate of a Lender (which shall be in reasonable detail) setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as specified in or and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof.

provided
     (e) If, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, (y) the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period or (z) the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from the Required Lenders of their determination in good faith that the rate of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Rate" upon the basis of which the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders. Upon such notice, (i) all then outstanding LIBOR Loans shall automatically, on the expiration date of the respective Interest Periods applicable thereto (unless then repaid in full), be converted into Base Rate Loans, (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, to convert Base Rate Loans into, or to continue, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (including pursuant to the Borrowing to which such Interest Period applies), and (iii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given at any time thereafter with respect to LIBOR Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans, in each case until the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, shall have determined that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist (and the Required Lenders, if making such determination, shall have so notified the Administrative Agent), and the Administrative Agent shall have so notified the Borrower and the Lenders.
     (f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if, at any time after the date hereof and from time to time, any Lender shall have determined in good faith that the introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance with any guideline or request from any such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), has or would have the effect of making it unlawful for such Lender to make or to continue to make or maintain LIBOR Loans, such Lender will forthwith so notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Upon such notice,
 
(i) each of such Lender's then outstanding LIBOR Loans shall automatically, on the expiration date of the respective Interest Period applicable thereto (or, to the extent any such LIBOR Loan may not lawfully be maintained as a LIBOR Loan until such expiration date, upon such notice) and to the extent not sooner prepaid, be converted into a Base Rate Loan, (ii) the obligation of such Lender to make, to convert Base Rate Loans into, or to continue, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (including pursuant to any Borrowing for which the Administrative Agent has received a Notice of Borrowing but for which the Borrowing Date has not arrived), and (iii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given at any time thereafter with respect to LIBOR Loans shall, as to such Lender, be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Loan, in each case until such Lender shall have determined that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist and shall have so notified the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall have so notified the Borrower.

Taxes.
     (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, that if the Borrower shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
     (b) Without limiting the provisions of , the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

A certificate (which shall be in reasonable detail) as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees to cooperate with any reasonable request made by the Borrower in respect of a claim of a refund in respect of Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this if (i) the Borrower has agreed in writing to pay all of the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to such claim, (ii) the Administrative Agent or such Lender determines, in its good faith judgment, that it would not be disadvantaged, unduly burdened or prejudiced as a result of such claim and (iii) the Borrower furnishes, upon request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, an

opinion of tax counsel (such opinion and such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender) to the effect that such Indemnified Taxes were wrongly or illegally imposed.
     (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
     (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
     (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
     (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,

     (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed
 
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
     (f) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

The Borrower will compensate each Lender upon demand for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Loans) that such Lender may incur or sustain (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a Borrowing or continuation of, or conversion into, a LIBOR Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, (ii) if any repayment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Loan occurs on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a consequence of any assignment made pursuant to or any acceleration of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to ), (iii) if any prepayment of any LIBOR Loan is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower or (iv) as a consequence of any other failure by the Borrower to make any payments with respect to any LIBOR Loan when due hereunder. Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Loan through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Loan, having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may fund its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this . A certificate (which shall be in reasonable detail) showing the bases for the determinations set forth in this by any Lender as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this shall be submitted by such Lender to the Borrower either directly or through the Administrative Agent. Determinations set forth in any such certificate made in good faith for purposes of this of any such losses, expenses or liabilities shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

THIS FINANCIAL CONDITION CERTIFICATE
Credit Agreement
INTERCONTINENTALEXCHANGE, INC.
Borrower
     The undersigned hereby certifies for and on behalf of the Borrower as follows:
     1. . The undersigned is, and at all pertinent times mentioned herein has been, the duly qualified and acting chief financial officer of the Borrower, and in such capacity has responsibility for the management of the Borrower's financial affairs and for the preparation of the Borrower's financial statements. The undersigned has, together with other officers of the Borrower, acted on behalf of the Borrower in connection with the negotiation and consummation of the Credit Agreement and the initial extensions of credit made under the Credit Agreement.
Capacity
     2. . For purposes of this Certificate, the undersigned has, as of or prior to the date hereof, undertaken the following activities in connection herewith:
Procedures
     2.1 The undersigned has carefully reviewed the following:
     (a) the contents of this Certificate;
     (b) the Credit Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules thereto); and
     (c) the audited and unaudited financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries referred to in of the Credit Agreement.
Section 4.
11(a)
     2.2 The undersigned has made inquiries of certain other officers and personnel of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries with responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding (i) whether the unaudited financial statements described in paragraph 2.1(c) above are in conformity with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with that of the audited financial statements described in paragraph 2.1(c) above (subject to the absence of footnotes required by GAAP and subject to normal year-end adjustments), and whether notes omitted from such unaudited financial statements would have disclosed any new information that would be necessary to make the statements contained therein, taken as a whole, not misleading, and (ii) whether such persons were aware of any events or conditions that, as of the date hereof, would cause the statements made in paragraph 3 below to be untrue in any material respect.
 
     2.3 With respect to any contingent liabilities of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, the undersigned:
     (a) has inquired of certain officers and other personnel of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries who have responsibility for the legal, financial and accounting affairs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, as to the existence and estimated amounts of all contingent liabilities known to them;
     (b) has confirmed with senior accounting officers of the Borrower that, to the best of such officers' knowledge, (i) all appropriate items have been included in contingent liabilities made known to the undersigned in the course of the inquiry of the undersigned in connection herewith, and (ii) the amounts relating thereto were the maximum estimated amounts of liability reasonably likely to result therefrom as of the date hereof, and
     (c) confirms that, to the best of the undersigned's knowledge, all material contingent liabilities that may arise from any pending litigation, asserted claims and assessments, guarantees, uninsured risks, and other relevant contingencies and circumstances have been considered in making the certification set forth herein, and with respect to each such contingent liability the maximum estimated amount of liability with respect thereto was used in making such certification.
     2.4 The undersigned has conferred with counsel to the Borrower for the purpose of discussing the meaning of the contents of this Certificate.
     3. . Based on the foregoing, the undersigned hereby certifies as follows:
Certifications
     3.1 The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are not insolvent now, and the incurrence by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of their respective liabilities and obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the initial extensions of credit made under the Credit Agreement, the payment of transaction fees and expenses related to the foregoing will not render them insolvent taken as a whole. The undersigned understands that, in this context, (i) "insolvent" means that the present fair saleable value of assets is less than the amount that will be required to be paid on or in respect of the existing debts as such debts mature in the ordinary course, (ii) "fair value" of assets means the aggregate amount that could be realized within a reasonable time, either through collection or sale of such assets at the regular market value as an ongoing business, conceiving of the latter as the amount that could be obtained for the property in question within such period by a capable and diligent seller from an interested buyer who is willing to purchase under ordinary selling conditions, and (iii) "debts" includes any legal liability, whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent, including any guaranty or other contingent obligation.
     3.2 The undersigned reasonably believes that, by the incurrence of their respective liabilities and obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the initial extensions of credit made under the Credit Agreement and the payment of transaction fees and expenses related to the foregoing, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
 
will not incur debts beyond their ability to pay as they mature in the ordinary course (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of such debts). The undersigned has concluded that the realization of current assets in the ordinary course of business should be sufficient to pay recurring current debt, short-term debt and long-term debt as such debts mature in their ordinary course, that the cash flow (including earnings plus non-cash charges to earnings) should be sufficient to provide cash necessary to repay loans made under the Credit Agreement and other long-term indebtedness as such debt matures in its ordinary course, and that the Borrower should have sufficient availability under the Credit Agreement to satisfy its working capital and short-term liquidity requirements.
