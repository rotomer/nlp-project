EARNINGS RELEASE
(August 4, 2008)  IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading operator of global exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) markets, reported its second strongest quarter ever, with consolidated net income for the second quarter of 2008 of $84.9 million, a 58% increase compared to $53.7 million for the second quarter of 2007.

"ICE's strong second quarter performance demonstrates our team's continued focus on growth and execution," said Jeffrey C. Sprecher, ICE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While producing organic growth in our core businesses, we worked toward the implementation of several long-term growth initiatives scheduled to take effect during the third quarter. We have spent the last year preparing for both the transition of our energy clearing to ICE Clear Europe and the commencement of exclusive trading of U.S. Russell index futures at ICE Futures U.S. We also expect to complete our acquisition of Creditex later this quarter and are already collaborating with the Creditex team on innovative initiatives to serve the global credit default swap markets. We continue to invest in new avenues of growth and to evaluate M&A opportunities to expand our position as one of the most global, diversified derivatives markets in the world."
"The fundamentals of our business remain solid, particularly given the increased need for risk management across futures and OTC markets," said Scott Hill, ICE Chief Financial Officer. "We've continued to grow our business substantially while generating synergies in our U.S. futures business and producing operating margins that reflect our disciplined approach to growth. This consistently strong performance provides us with the balance sheet and cash flows necessary to execute the share repurchase program recently authorized by our Board of Directors, even as we continue to invest for future growth. This program reflects our belief that the current share price does not appropriately reflect the strong underlying fundamentals of our global business. In compliance with SEC rules, we will begin the repurchase of shares after the Creditex acquisition closes."
ICE's second quarter 2008 consolidated revenues increased 44% to $197.2 million compared to $136.7 million in the second quarter of 2007. Consolidated transaction revenues increased 42% to $166.7 million in the second quarter of 2008, from $117.4 million during the same period in 2007. The increase in transaction revenue was driven primarily by new products, strong trading volume in ICE's futures and global OTC segments, and the entry of new participants in all markets.
Second Quarter 2008 Results
Transaction revenues in ICE's futures segment, comprising ICE Futures Europe, ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada, totaled $87.1 million in the second quarter of 2008, an increase of 23% over $70.8 million in the same period in 2007.
In the second quarter of 2008, ICE Futures Europe recorded volume of 39.6 million contracts. ADV for ICE's European futures business was 610,187 contracts, an increase of 19% compared to the second quarter of 2007. The average rate per contract (RPC) for ICE Futures Europe in the second quarter was $1.21. ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada recorded second quarter volume of 17.6 million contracts and 0.9 million contracts, respectively. ADV for ICE Futures U.S. was 274,420 contracts in the second quarter of 2008, a 13% increase compared to the same period in 2007. ADV for ICE Futures Canada was 13,633 contracts during the quarter, an 11% decrease compared to the year-ago period. Second quarter RPC for ICE Futures U.S. agricultural futures and options contracts was $2.21.
Second quarter 2008 transaction revenues in ICE's global OTC segment increased 71% to $79.6 million, compared to $46.6 million in the same period in 2007. ADC increased 69% to $1.2 million compared to $718,000 in the second quarter of 2007. Average daily commissions reflect daily trading activity in ICE's OTC markets. Cleared contracts accounted for 90% of OTC contract volume during the second quarter of 2008.

Consolidated market data revenues increased 61% during the second quarter of 2008 to a record $25.5 million compared to $15.8 million in the same period in 2007. Consolidated other revenues increased $1.6 million during the second quarter to $5.0 million, from $3.4 million in the same period of 2007.
Consolidated operating expenses for the second quarter of 2008 were $64.4 million, an increase of 7% compared to $60.1 million in the same period of 2007. Adjusted to exclude the non-recurring $10.9 million in CBOT merger-related transaction expenses incurred during the second quarter of 2007, consolidated operating expenses would have increased 31% compared to the second quarter of 2007. The increase was driven by continued investment in growth initiatives, additional depreciation and amortization expenses, and higher compensation expenses. Spending associated with ICE Clear Europe increased from $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2007 to $3.6 million in the same period of 2008. Depreciation related primarily to technology investments grew by $1.7 million to a total of $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2008. Amortization expenses on acquired intangibles were $3.6 million for the second quarter of 2008 compared to $2.2 million in the same period of 2007. Non-cash compensation for the quarter increased to $9.9 million, compared to $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily due to costs recognized for performance-based restricted stock granted in December 2006 and December 2007, including a cumulative year-to-date performance adjustment of $1.9 million recorded during the second quarter of 2008.
Second quarter 2008 consolidated operating income was $132.8 million, up 74% compared to $76.5 million in operating income in the second quarter of 2007. Operating margin was 67% for the second quarter of 2008, compared to 56% for the same period in 2007 on a GAAP basis, or 64% for the second quarter of 2007 excluding CBOT merger-related expenses.

The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2008 was 35.5% compared to 28.6% for the second quarter of 2007. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2007 was impacted by ICE's decision to indefinitely reinvest prior and current undistributed foreign earnings. The impact from this change included a non-recurring benefit to net income of $3.6 million recognized in the second quarter of 2007 related to the reversal of the tax liability on prior period foreign earnings.
ICE's first half 2008 consolidated revenues grew to $404.4 million, an increase of 54% compared to the first half of 2007. ICE's first half futures volumes increased 25% to 121 million contracts, driving consolidated futures transaction revenues growth of 39% over the same period in 2007. ICE's consolidated global OTC transaction revenues increased 70%, driven by ADC of $1.2 million per day, a 69% increase over 2007. Consolidated market data revenues grew 68% compared to the first half of 2007. Consolidated operating margins improved to 69% in the first half of 2008, and consolidated net income grew 62% to $177.2 million.
First Half 2008 Results
Cash flows from operations during the first half of 2008 totaled $191.6 million, compared to $94.8 million in the first six months of 2007. Unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at June 30, 2008 totaled $374.4 million. ICE ended the second quarter with $203.1 million in debt relating to the acquisition of ICE Futures U.S. Capital expenditures during the first half of 2008 were $7.9 million.

The ICE Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million in ICE common stock over the next 12 months. Any such repurchases will be made in compliance with applicable U.S. laws. ICE intends to adopt a written stock trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A Rule 10b5-1 trading plan allows ICE to repurchase shares at times when it ordinarily would not be in the market because of ICE's trading policies or the possession of material non-public information. ICE expects to fund any share repurchases with a combination of cash on hand, future cash flows and its existing line of credit. The timing and extent of the repurchases will depend upon market conditions. ICE is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares and may amend, suspend or terminate the repurchase program at any time.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation
We provide adjusted consolidated net income, adjusted earnings per common share, adjusted consolidated operating expenses and adjusted consolidated operating margin as additional information regarding our operating results. We believe the presentation of these measures is useful for period-to-period comparison of results because the CBOT merger-related transaction costs incurred in the second quarter of 2007 do not reflect historical operating performance. We incurred incremental direct costs of $10.9 million during the six months and three months ended June 30, 2007 related to our proposed merger with CBOT. We did not succeed in our proposed merger with CBOT, and CME Holdings completed its acquisition of CBOT on July 13, 2007. The $10.9 million in merger-related transaction costs include investment banking advisors, legal, accounting, proxy advisor, public relation services and other external costs directly related to the proposed transaction.
The non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures, including our consolidated statement of income provided above and the reconciliation provided below. Management uses these adjusted measures to evaluate operating performance. When viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone.
The following table reconciles consolidated net income to adjusted consolidated net income, earnings per common share to adjusted earnings per common share, consolidated operating expenses to adjusted consolidated operating expenses and consolidated operating margin to adjusted consolidated operating margin.
