Consolidated transaction revenues increased 30% to $171 million in the third quarter of 2008, from $131 million during the same period in 2007. The increase in transaction revenue was driven primarily by new products, strong trading volume in ICE's futures and global OTC segments, an increase of participants in ICE's markets and the Creditex acquisition, which closed during the third quarter.
Transaction revenues in ICE's consolidated futures segment, comprising ICE Futures Europe, ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada, totaled $81 million in the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 11% over $73 million in the same period in 2007.
