Exhibit 99.1
EARNINGS RELEASE
(February 10, 2009)  IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading operator of regulated global exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) markets, reported that consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter rose to a record $207 million, a 30% increase over fourth quarter 2007 revenues of $159 million. Consolidated net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $49 million, a 24% decrease compared to $65 million for the prior fourth quarter. Adjusted to exclude the $16 million pre-tax, or $11 million after-tax, impairment charge related to ICE's investment in the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) of India, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $60 million, a decrease of 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted GAAP earnings per share (EPS) in the fourth quarter were $0.67. Adjusted to exclude the NCDEX impairment charge, non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter were $0.82, down 9% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter.
ATLANTA, GA
For the year ended December 31, 2008, ICE achieved record revenues for the fifth consecutive year, reporting a 42% rise in consolidated revenues to $813 million compared with $574 million in the prior year. Consolidated GAAP net income increased 25% to a record $301 million in 2008 from $241 million in 2007, and diluted EPS for 2008 increased 23% to $4.17. Adjusted to exclude the NCDEX impairment charge, non-GAAP net income for 2008 was $312 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS were $4.33, up 30% and 28% over 2007, respectively. Consolidated cash flow from operations grew 30% to a record $375 million in 2008.
 
Volume in ICE's consolidated futures segment, comprising ICE Futures Europe, ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada, reached a record 237 million contracts in 2008, an increase of 21% over 2007. In 2008, average daily volume (ADV) for ICE Futures Europe was 590,541; ADV for ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada was 331,317 contracts. Average daily commissions (ADC) for ICE's OTC energy markets during 2008 increased to a record $1.1 million, a 32% increase over 2007. Creditex Group Inc., ICE's wholly-owned credit derivatives subsidiary, had brokerage revenues of $52 million, which are also reflected in ICE's OTC segment for the period of September 2008 through December 2008. ICE completed its acquisition of Creditex on August 29, 2008.
"We excelled in a challenging year by responding to the needs of customers, expanding the markets we serve and executing on our strategic and financial objectives," said ICE Chairman and CEO, Jeffrey C. Sprecher. "As we enter 2009, we again have a range of initiatives, market opportunities and plans for growth based on the strong global risk management infrastructure ICE has established. Extending further into the OTC markets by developing CDS clearing is just one initiative designed to leverage our infrastructure. While we anticipate another challenging year in the global markets, we believe we are well positioned to meet our customers' risk management needs amid volatility and change."
"Our long-standing disciplined approach to managing our financial performance has served us well, particularly given the global economic climate of the past 12 months," said ICE CFO Scott Hill. "We have an excellent balance sheet, including low leverage and strong cash flow, as well as a business model that is diversified across futures and OTC markets, geographies and customer types. Our focus on smart growth and disciplined investment has allowed us to produce excellent results for our shareholders while weathering uncertainty in the broader markets."
ICE's fourth quarter 2008 consolidated revenues increased 30% to $207 million compared to $159 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Consolidated transaction and clearing revenues increased 34% to $178 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, from $133 million during the same period in 2007. The increase in transaction and clearing revenue was driven primarily by new products, strong trading volume in ICE's futures and global OTC segments, the launch of ICE Clear Europe in November 2008, an increase of participants in ICE's markets and the Creditex acquisition.
Fourth Quarter 2008 Results
Transaction and clearing revenues in ICE's consolidated futures segment totaled $86 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 18% over $72 million in the same period in 2007. Fourth quarter 2008 volume for all ICE futures exchanges increased to 60 million contracts, which is a 22% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. ICE Futures Europe recorded quarterly volume of 37 million contracts. ADV for ICE's European futures business was 569,140 contracts, an increase of 3% over the fourth quarter of 2007. The average rate per contract (RPC) for ICE Futures Europe in the fourth quarter was $1.42. ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada recorded fourth quarter volume of 23 million contracts and 0.7 million contracts, respectively. ADV for ICE Futures U.S. was 350,395 contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008, a 74% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Total volume for ICE Futures U.S. represented the highest quarter in exchange history, due in part to the successful transition of the Russell Index futures complex in September. RPC for ICE Futures U.S. agricultural futures and options contracts was $2.25, and the RPC for financial contracts averaged $0.78 for the fourth quarter of 2008. ADV for ICE Futures Canada was 11,625 contracts during the quarter compared to 17,347 in the year-ago period.
 
Fourth quarter 2008 transaction and clearing revenues in ICE's global OTC segment increased 54% to $92 million, compared to $60 million in the same period in 2007. In ICE's OTC energy markets, ADC were $872,440, a decline of 4% from $912,967 in the same period of 2007. Cleared contracts accounted for 95% of OTC energy contract volume during the fourth quarter of 2008. In ICE's credit derivative markets, fourth quarter revenues were $36 million, roughly flat versus the same period in 2007 on a pro- forma basis. ICE did not own Creditex in 2007.
Consolidated market data revenues increased 16% during the fourth quarter of 2008 to a record $27 million compared to $23 million in the same period in 2007. Consolidated other revenues were $2 million during the fourth quarter of 2008.
Consolidated operating expenses increased $47 million to $110 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 versus $63 million in the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily driven by $33 million of expenses relating to Creditex's business following ICE's acquisition during the third quarter of 2008 and continued investment in growth initiatives. Amortization expenses on acquired intangibles were $16 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $3 million in the same period of 2007, and included $6 million related to the Creditex acquisition and $6 million related to ICE's exclusive Russell license. Depreciation expense, primarily related to technology investments, was $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 30% over the fourth quarter of 2007.
Fourth quarter 2008 consolidated operating income was $97 million, an increase of 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Consolidated operating margin was 47% for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to 61% for the same period in 2007.
ICE has taken a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $16 million related to its 8% equity ownership in NCDEX, a derivatives exchange located in Mumbai, India. ICE acquired its stake for $37 million in 2006. In response to political pressure regarding high commodity prices, the Indian government suspended trading in several key agricultural contracts traded on NCDEX during 2007, and that ban remains in place. The Indian government also announced a law that may require foreign entities, including ICE, to divest holdings above an imposed limit of 5% total ownership in Indian commodities exchanges. This may result in ICE reducing its stake in NCDEX from 8% to the 5% threshold by June 30, 2009. Considering these factors and current valuations in the global exchange sector, management determined that its cost method investment in NCDEX is impaired under U.S. GAAP standards. ICE continues to work closely with NCDEX as a key strategic partner, which provides access to an important emerging market.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 39.8% compared to 32.7% for the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in the tax rate was primarily the result of the tax effect of the NCDEX impairment charge and an increase in the percentage of income taxable in the U.S. at higher statutory rates, such as in New York State.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, consolidated revenues increased 42% to $813 million compared to $574 million in 2007. Consolidated transaction and clearing revenues increased 41% to $693 million in 2008 from $490 million in 2007. The increase in transaction and clearing revenues was driven primarily by new products, strong trading volume in ICE's futures and global OTC segments, an increase of participants in ICE's markets and the Creditex acquisition.

Consolidated Financial Statements
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation
ICE provides adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share as additional information regarding its operating results. ICE uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate its performance and in making financial and operational decisions. ICE believes that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, ICE believes the presentation of these measures is useful for period-to-period comparison of results because the NCDEX cost method impairment charge described below does not reflect historical operating performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. ICE strongly recommends that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
Adjusted net income for the 2008 periods below is calculated by adding net income and the NCDEX impairment charge, presented net of tax. ICE does not believe this item is representative of its future operating performance since the charge was not consistent with its historical operations. ICE believes that the NCDEX impairment charge is an unusual expense and is not representative of historical operating performance. Adjusted earnings per common share are calculated as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding. These calculations exclude the NCDEX impairment charge. The following table reconciles the 2008 net income to adjusted net income and calculates adjusted earnings per common share.
