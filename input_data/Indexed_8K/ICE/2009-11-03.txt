Said ICE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher: ICE has brought innovation to the financial services sector to help ensure the health of the markets we serve, while maintaining a focus on growth. Over the past year, our markets have shown resilience as customers worldwide increasingly demand the trading and risk management services we offer. We believe that the financial market reforms currently under way will provide greater certainty to market participants, as well as additional opportunities for ICE to leverage the valuable exchange, technology and clearing infrastructure that it has developed over the past decade.
ICE CFO Scott Hill added: Our results in the third quarter reflect strong performance in our core business, as well as ongoing investment in and successful execution of newer initiatives, such as OTC clearing. In addition to top-line growth, our operating margins again improved sequentially, and we delivered increased earnings and cash flow. Our consistent cash generation, strong balance sheet and disciplined investment throughout the market downturn position us well to deliver increasing value to our customers and shareholders.

Third Quarter 2009 Results
ICEs third quarter 2009 consolidated revenues increased 27% to $256 million, compared to $201 million in the third quarter of 2008. Consolidated transaction and clearing fee revenues in the quarter grew 34% to $229 million, from $171 million in the third quarter of 2008. The increase in transaction and clearing fee revenues was driven primarily by new products, strong trading volume in ICEs futures and OTC energy segments, continued growth since the launch of ICE Clear Europe in November 2008 and the addition of OTC credit derivatives execution, processing and clearing services.
Transaction and clearing fee revenues in ICEs futures segment totaled $104 million in the third quarter of 2009, an increase of 28% from $81 million in the same period in 2008. Average daily volume (ADV) for ICEs futures exchanges increased 24% from the same period in the prior year to a record 1,062,429 contracts, and total volume in the quarter rose to a record 68 million contracts. ICE Futures Europe ADV was a record 676,020 contracts, an increase of 19% from the third quarter of 2008, and total volume reached a record 43.3 million contracts. The rate per contract (RPC) for ICE Futures Europe in the third quarter of 2009 was $1.53.
ICE Futures U.S. ADV was 375,772 contracts, which was 34% higher than third quarter 2008 ADV of 280,317 contracts. RPC for ICE Futures U.S. agricultural futures and options contracts was $2.08, and RPC for financial contracts averaged $0.89 in the third quarter of 2009. ADV for ICE Futures Canada was 10,637 contracts during the third quarter, an increase of 12% compared to 9,526 contracts in the year-ago period. ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada recorded third quarter volume of 24.0 million and 0.7 million contracts, respectively.
Third quarter 2009 transaction and clearing fee revenues in ICEs global OTC segment increased 39% to $125 million, compared to $90 million for the comparable period in 2008. Average daily commissions (ADC) for ICEs OTC energy business were $1.25 million, an increase of 12% from $1.11 million in the same period of 2008. Cleared contracts accounted for 96% of OTC energy contract volume during the third quarter of 2009. In ICEs credit derivative markets, third quarter transaction and clearing fee revenues were $43 million, up 6% versus the same period in 2008 on a pro-forma basis. ICE acquired Creditex in August 2008.
Consolidated market data revenues were $25 million in the third quarter of 2009, a decline of 3% from the same period in 2008. Consolidated other revenues were $3 million during the third quarter of 2009, compared to $5 million in the third quarter of 2008.
Consolidated operating expenses increased 41% to $116 million in the quarter, compared to $82 million in third quarter of 2008. This increase is primarily attributable to a $27 million rise in expenses relating to ICEs credit derivatives execution, processing and clearing initiatives, including compensation expenses and amortization of intangibles. After acquiring Creditex in August 2008, ICE acquired The Clearing Corporation (TCC) in March 2009 and launched credit default swaps (CDS) clearing via ICE Trust and ICE Clear Europe in March and July 2009, respectively. Though the credit business continued to require heavy investment common to start-up initiatives, the underlying operating margins improved, and the business was cash positive in the quarter.  The expense growth was also due, to a lesser extent, to ICE recording a full quarter of amortization expense in the third quarter of 2009 for its Russell license agreement totaling $6.5 million, compared to $685,000 in the prior third quarter.

Consolidated operating income in the quarter grew 17% to $140 million, compared to third quarter 2008 operating income of $119 million. Operating margin was 55%, compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2009, and 59% in the prior third quarter.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.8%, compared to 36.6% for the third quarter of 2008.

Futures volumes in the first three quarters grew 10% to 195.2 million contracts, driving consolidated futures transaction and clearing fee revenue growth of 16% compared to same period of 2008. ICEs global OTC transaction revenues were $348 million in the first nine months of the year, an increase of 40% from the same period in 2008, driven primarily by the addition of revenues related to Creditex and CDS clearing. ICEs OTC energy business delivered ADC of $1.16 million in the first nine months of the year, a decline of 4% from the same period of 2008. Consolidated market data revenues were $76 million, in-line with the first three quarters of 2008. Consolidated operating margins were 53% for the first nine months of 2009.
For the first nine months of 2009, consolidated net income was $231 million on a GAAP basis, with EPS of $3.13. During the first quarter of 2009, consolidated operating expenses also included pre-tax charges of $11 million related to ICEs acquisition of TCC and other restructuring charges. In addition, in the second quarter of 2009, ICE took a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $9 million related to its investment in the National Commodity Derivatives Exchange in India (NCDEX).  Excluding these first quarter charges and the NCDEX impairment in the second quarter of 2009, net of taxes, adjusted consolidated net income for the first three quarters of 2009 was $251 million and adjusted diluted EPS were $3.39, compared to $252 million and $3.51 for the first nine months of 2008.  Adjusted consolidated net income and diluted EPS declined 1% and 3%, respectively, compared to the first nine months of 2008.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation
ICE provides adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share as additional information regarding our operating results. ICE uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the companys performance and in making financial and operational decisions. ICE believes that its presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, ICE believes the presentation of these measures is useful for period-to-period comparison of results because the charges identified below do not reflect historical operating performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. ICE strongly recommends that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this press release and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including ICEs consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
When viewed in conjunction with ICEs GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, ICE believes adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share provide a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. ICE management uses adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to evaluate operating performance and management decisions made during the reporting period by excluding certain items that the company believes have less significance on, or do not impact, the day-to-day performance of the business. ICEs internal budgets are based on adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, and the company reports its adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to ICEs Audit Committee and its Board of Directors. In addition, adjusted net income is one of the criteria considered in determining performance-based compensation. ICE understands that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, to assess operating performance. ICE uses adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share because they more clearly highlight trends in the business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share eliminates from the companys results specific financial items that have less bearing on ICEs operating performance.
 
 
The tax impact of the NCDEX impairment loss was additional tax expense of $1.8 million due to the recording of a valuation allowance, related to the deferred tax benefit recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2008, which was in excess of the tax benefit recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
