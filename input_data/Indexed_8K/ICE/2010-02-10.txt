For the year ended December 31, 2009, ICE reported its sixth consecutive record year of consolidated revenues totaling $995 million, up 22% compared to 2008 revenues of $813 million. Consolidated 2009 net income attributable to ICE increased 5% to a record $316 million from $301 million in 2008, and diluted EPS increased 2% to $4.27 from $4.17. Consolidated cash flow from operations grew 30% to a record $487 million in 2009.
During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, including during the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, certain items were included in ICEs operating results that management believes are not indicative of its operating performance. For the year ended December 31, 2009, consolidated adjusted net income attributable to ICE excluding these items was $334 million, up 7% from $312 million in 2008. For the fourth quarter of 2009, consolidated adjusted net income attributable to ICE excluding these items was $84 million, an increase of 39% versus the prior fourth quarter.

ICE executed on its strategic and financial objectives with focus, speed and discipline in 2009, said Scott Hill, ICE CFO. We delivered record financial performance and completed the integration of Creditex and The Clearing Corporation to deliver CDS clearing, while maintaining best-in-class technology, growing our core business, investing in future growth and strengthening our growth- and customer-focused company culture.
ICE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher said: ICEs consistently strong performance, regardless of market conditions, is a result of our unwavering focus on our core markets, and on opportunities to expand our business to serve the evolving needs of our customers. In 2002, ICE took a leadership role in developing OTC clearing for the energy markets, and in 2009 we again led in developing a complete CDS clearing business. With a global footprint across trade execution, processing and clearing, ICE will continue to innovate and extend its risk management services, while creating value for our shareholders.
Fourth Quarter 2009 Results
Consolidated revenues grew 24% to $257 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $207 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Quarterly consolidated transaction and clearing fee revenues increased 29% to $229 million, from $178 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in transaction and clearing fee revenues was driven primarily by strong trading volume in ICEs futures and OTC energy segments, new products, and the addition of credit derivatives execution, processing and clearing.
Transaction and clearing fee revenues in ICEs futures segment totaled $102 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 19% from $86 million in the same period of 2008. Consolidated average daily volume in ICEs futures segment in the fourth quarter was 1,048,501 contracts, up 13% from the same period of 2008.
 
Transaction and clearing fee revenues in ICEs global OTC segment increased 37% to $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $92 million for the comparable period in 2008. Average daily commissions (ADC) for ICEs OTC energy business were $1.3 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 53% from $872,440 in the fourth quarter of 2008. Cleared contracts accounted for 97% of OTC energy contract volume during the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to 95% in the fourth quarter of 2008. In ICEs credit derivatives business, fourth quarter revenues totaled $39 million, comprised of $29 million from Creditex and $10 million from credit default swaps (CDS) clearing.
 
Fourth quarter 2009 consolidated market data revenues were $25 million, compared to $27 million in the same period of 2008.
 
Consolidated operating expenses increased 21% to $133 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $110 million in fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is primarily attributable to an $11 million increase in expenses related to credit derivatives execution, processing and clearing. ICE also incurred additional compensation expense of $5 million in the quarter relating to increased employee bonuses due to very strong fourth quarter performance that enabled ICE to further exceed its Board-established financial targets for 2009. As included in previous guidance, ICE also recorded $10 million in severance and tax-related expenses that are not indicative of its operating performance.
Also during the fourth quarter of 2009, ICE recorded an additional $11 million in non-operating income related to cost method investments, including the disposition of its stake in LCH.Clearnet.
 
 
 
 
Consolidated operating income grew 27% to $124 million, compared to $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating margin was 48%, compared to 47% in the prior fourth quarter. Adjusted for the aforementioned items, adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $133 million, up 37%, and adjusted operating margin was 52%. Please refer to the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release for more information on adjusted operating income.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.9%, compared to 39.8% for the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline in the tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the NCDEX impairment charge and additional foreign tax credits.
Full-Year 2009 Results
For the year ended December 31, 2009, consolidated revenues were $995 million, an increase of 22% from $813 million in 2008. Consolidated transaction and clearing revenues rose 28% to $884 million in 2009 from $693 million in 2008. The growth in transaction and clearing revenues was driven primarily by new clearing houses, new products, strong trading volume in ICEs futures and global OTC segments, an increase in the number of participants in ICEs markets, and the acquisition of Creditex.
Transaction and clearing revenues in ICEs consolidated futures segment totaled $410 million in 2009, up 17% from $352 million in 2008. Volume in ICEs consolidated futures segment, comprising ICE Futures Europe, ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada, rose 11% over 2008, reaching a record 262 million contracts. ADV in 2009 was 1,035,887 contracts, crossing one million contracts for the first time.
 
Transaction and clearing revenues in ICEs global OTC segment increased 39% to $475 million in 2009 from $342 million in 2008. ADC for ICEs OTC energy business increased 8% to a record $1.20 million in 2009, compared to $1.12 million in 2008, and represented the sixth consecutive year of record ADC. Cleared contracts accounted for 96% of OTC energy contract volume throughout 2009, compared to 91% during 2008. Revenues from ICEs CDS businesses, both execution and clearing, totaled $165 million in 2009, comprised of $134 million from Creditex and $31 million from global CDS clearing. To date, ICE's CDS clearing houses have cleared over $5.5 trillion in gross notional value, including $4.6 trillion during 2009.
Consolidated market data revenues of $102 million in 2009 were roughly flat compared to $103 million in 2008.
 
Consolidated operating expenses during 2009 were $482 million, an increase of 51% compared to $320 million in 2008. The increase was attributable to a $126 million increase in spending related to our credit execution, processing and clearing businesses, a $19 million increase related to the amortization of expenses related to our Russell agreement and $22 million in various other expenses in 2009 related to the acquisition of The Clearing Corporation (TCC), employee termination costs, certain state tax true-up items and costs incurred to vacate office space as detailed in the non-GAAP reconciliation.
Consolidated operating income for the full year was $513 million, an increase of 4% from $494 million in 2008. Operating margin was 52% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 61% for the same period in 2008. Adjusted for the aforementioned items, full year adjusted operating income was $534 million, up 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 54%.
 
 
 
 
The effective tax rate for both 2009 and 2008 was 36.4%.
Consolidated cash flow from operations was $487 million, up 30% from $375 million in 2008. Capital expenditures for 2009 were $25 million, compared to $30 million in 2008. Capitalized software development costs totaled $20 million for the full year, compared to $18 million in 2008.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation
net income attributable to ICE, adjusted earnings per common share attributable to ICE, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin
ICE presents adjusted
as additional information regarding our operating results. ICE uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the company's performance and in making financial and operational decisions. ICE believes that its presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, ICE believes the presentation of these measures is useful for period-to-period comparison of results because the charges identified below are unusual and infrequent and not representative of our historical operating performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. ICE strongly recommends that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this press release and its Annual Report on Form 10-K, including ICE's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

When viewed in conjunction with ICE's GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, ICE believes these adjusted measures provide a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. ICE management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and management decisions made during the reporting period by excluding certain items that the company believes have less significance on, or do not impact, the day-to-day performance of the business. ICE's internal budgets are based on adjusted
and
, and the company reports these measures to its Audit Committee and its Board of Directors. In addition, adjusted
is one of the criteria considered in determining performance-based compensation. ICE understands that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance. ICE uses these adjusted measures because they more clearly highlight trends in the business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since they eliminate from the company's results specific financial items that have less bearing on ICE's operating performance.
The following table reconciles our net income attributable to ICE to adjusted net income attributable to ICE and calculates adjusted earnings per common share attributable to ICE for the periods presented below.
