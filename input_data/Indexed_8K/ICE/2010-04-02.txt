          In connection with entering into the New Credit Facilities described below in Item 2.03, on March 31, 2010, IntercontinentalExchange, Inc., a Delaware corporation (ICE) terminated its Credit Agreement, dated as of April 9, 2009, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (successor by merger to Wachovia Bank, National Association) (Wells Fargo), as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A. (BofA), as Syndication Agent, and the lenders named therein, which provided for a $300.0 million 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on April 9, 2010 (filed as Exhibit 10.2 to ICEs Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed on April 14, 2009). Further, the $100.0 million unsecured revolving cr edit facility contained in the 2007 Credit Facility was terminated as described below in Item 2.03.
 
          On March 31, 2010, ICE entered into new aggregate $725.0 million three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facilities (the New Credit Facilities) pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the New Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent, BofA, as Syndication Agent, and the lenders named therein. The New Credit Facilities include an option for ICE to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available by $100.0 million during the term of the New Credit Facilities. A copy of the New Credit Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the following summary of the New Credit Facilities is qualified in its entirety thereby.
 
          The New Credit Facilities consist of (i) an aggregate $575.0 million unsecured revolving dollar credit facility (the Dollar Facility), pursuant to which ICE may borrow, repay and reborrow up to $575.0 million in U.S. dollars, and (ii) an aggregate $150.0 million unsecured revolving multicurrency credit facility, pursuant to which ICE may borrow, repay and reborrow up to the equivalent of $150.0 million in either U.S. dollars, Euros or U.K. sterling, at the option of ICE. Standby letters of credit may be issued under the Dollar Facility, and the Dollar Facility includes a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. No amounts were borrowed under the New Credit Facilities as of the closing of the facilities. The New Credit Facilities mature on March 31, 2013.< /font>
 
          Each loan under the New Credit Facilities shall, at the option of ICE, bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin rate. The base rate will be equal to the higher of (i) Wells Fargos prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.50%. The applicable margin rate ranges from 2.00% to 3.00% on the LIBOR loans and from 1.00% to 2.00% for the base rate loans based on ICEs total leverage ratio calculated on a trailing twelve-month period. Interest on each outstanding borrowing is payable quarterly with respect to base rate loans and either monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly with respect to LI BOR loans depending upon the interest period selected by ICE.
 
 
 
 
 
          The New Credit Facilities include an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount multiplied by an applicable margin rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The applicable margin rate ranges from 0.35% to 0.50% based on ICEs total leverage ratio calculated on a trailing twelve-month period. Based on this calculation, the applicable margin rate was 0.35% as of March 31, 2010.
 
          The proceeds of the loans, if any, under the New Credit Facilities shall be used as follows: (i) up to $150.0 million of the proceeds of the loans shall be used to provide liquidity for the clearing operations of ICE Clear Europe Limited, a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales and wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE; (ii) up to $50.0 million of the proceeds of the loans shall be used to provide liquidity for the clearing operations of ICE Clear U.S., Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE; (iii) up to $100.0 million of the proceeds of the loans shall be used to provide liquidity for the clearing operations of ICE Trust U.S. LLC, a New York limited liability trust company and subsidiary of ICE; (iv) up to $3.0 million of the proceed s of the loans shall be used to provide liquidity for the clearing operations of ICE Clear Canada, Inc., a Manitoba corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE; and (v) the remainder, plus any portion of the proceeds no longer necessary to be reserved for the foregoing purposes, shall be used to provide for working capital and general corporate purposes of ICE.
 
          With limited exceptions, ICE may prepay the outstanding loans under the New Credit Facilities, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The New Credit Facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, leverage and interest coverage ratios, as well as limitations or required notices or approvals for acquisitions, dispositions of assets and certain investments in subsidiaries, the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other fundamental changes to ICEs business. ICE is currently in compliance with all applicable covenants under the New Credit Facilities.
 
          In connection with entering into the New Credit Facilities, on March 31, 2010, ICE also entered into (i) a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amendment to 2007 Credit Facility), amending ICEs existing Credit Agreement, dated as of January 12, 2007, as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of August 24, 2007, the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of June 13, 2008, and as amended and restated by the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, dated as of April 9, 2009, with Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, BofA, as syndication agent, and the lenders party thereto (filed as Exhibit 10.1 to ICEs Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed on April 14, 2009, the 2007 Credit FacilityR 21;), and (ii) a First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Amendment to 2009 Credit Facility), amending ICEs existing Credit Agreement, dated as of April 9, 2009, with Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, BofA, as syndication agent, and the lenders party thereto (filed as Exhibit 10.3 to ICEs Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed on April 14, 2009, the 2009 Credit Facility). A copy of each of the Amendment to 2007 Credit Facility and the Amendment to 2009 Credit Facility is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2 and Exhibit 10.3, respectively, and is incorporated herein by reference, and the following summary of such Amendments is qualified in its entirety thereby.
 
 
 
 
 
 
          The Amendment to 2007 Credit Facility amended the 2007 Credit Facility to (i) permit the consummation of the New Credit Facilities and (ii) make certain other amendments thereto,
