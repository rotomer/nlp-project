Item 1.01.                  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On April 30, 2010, the boards of IntercontinentalExchange, Inc., a Delaware corporation (ICE), and Climate Exchange plc (Climate Exchange) announced that they have reached an agreement on the terms of the recommended acquisition by Aether Ios Limited , a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE (Bidco), of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Climate Exchange (the Acquisition).  Under the terms of the Acquisition, Climate Exchanges shareholders will receive 750 pence in cash for each Climate Exchange share, valuing the entire existing issued and to be issued share capital of Climate Exchange at approximately 395 million.
The Acquisition represents a premium of approximately:
 
 
 
It is intended that the Acquisition be implemented by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 152 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1931 (the Scheme).  The Scheme will be subject to the following conditions:
It is expected that a document including (among other things) the full terms of the Scheme (the Scheme Document) will be posted no later than May 28, 2010 and that the Scheme will become effective and the Acquisition completed by the end of July 2010, subject to the satisfaction or (if applicable) waiver of all relevant conditions.  Upon the Scheme becoming effective, it will be binding on all Climate Exchange shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the Court Meeting or the Climate Exchange EGM.
 
2
 
 
The board of directors (the Directors) of Climate Exchange, who have been so advised by J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Kinmont, consider the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and reasonable.  he Directors of Climate Exchange have agreed to unanimously recommend that Climate Exchange shareholders vote in favor of the resolutions to be proposed to Climate Exchange shareholders at the Court Meeting and the Climate Exchange EGM.
In providing advice to the Directors of
Climate Exchange
, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Kinmont have taken into account the commercial assessments of the Directors of
Climate Exchange
. Accordingly, t
In addition, Bidco has received irrevocable undertakings from the Directors of Climate Exchange and from Invesco Asset Management Limited (Invesco) to vote in favor of the resolutions to be proposed to Climate Exchange shareholders at the Court Meeting and the Climate Exchange EGM in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings of Climate Exchange shares.  ICE has therefore received irrevocable undertakings with respect to 23,030,901 Climate Exchange shares, which represents approximately 48.4 per cent. of Climate Exchanges entire existing issued share capital.  Together with ICE's holding of 2,277,034 Climate Exchange shares (representing approximately 4.8 per cent. of Climate Exchanges existing entire issued share capital), this represents approximately 53.2 per cent. of the entire exist ing issued share capital of Climate Exchange.  The undertakings from the Directors of Climate Exchange will continue to be binding even in the event of a higher competing offer for Climate Exchange being announced.
 
Climate Exchange and Bidco have entered into an implementation agreement that provides, among other things, for the implementation of the Scheme and contains certain assurances and confirmations between the parties, including with respect to the implementation of the Scheme and regarding the conduct of the business of Climate Exchange in the period prior to the date on which the Scheme becomes effective.  Climate Exchange has also undertaken not to solicit any other potential alternative offers.
The Acquisition will affect Climate Exchange share options and incentive awards granted under the Climate Exchange share schemes and Climate Exchange warrants.  An appropriate offer or proposal will be made in due course to holders of Climate Exchange options and warrants.  Details of these offers or proposals will be set out in the Scheme Document and in separate letters to be sent to participants in the Climate Exchange share schemes and warrant holders.
 
In relation to the cash consideration payable by Bidco under the terms of the Acquisition, $220 million has been drawn from ICEs existing credit facilities and the remainder will be funded from its existing cash resources.  Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley, is satisfied that sufficient financial resources are available to Bidco to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable under the terms of the Acquisition.
 
On April 30, 2010, ICE and Climate Exchange issued an announcement regarding the Acquisition that contains additional details regarding the Acquisition and the implementation of the Scheme (the Announcement).  A copy of the Announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. On May 4, 2010, further to an announcement by Invesco on April 30, 2010, ICE and Bidco issued an announcement to reflect the current number of shares over which irrevocable undertakings in respect of Climate Exchange shares had been received. A copy of this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2.  Consummation of the Acquisition is subject to various customary conditions, including the conditions specified in Appendix 1 of the Announcement. Further details of the irrevocable undertakings described above, and the circu mstances in which they will fall away, are set out in the Announcement.

Commenting on the Acquisition, Jeffrey C. Sprecher, Chairman and CEO of ICE, said:
 
The combination of Climate Exchanges emissions markets and ICEs futures and over-the-counter energy markets is an important and logical strategic combination for our customers and shareholders, and clearly an exciting opportunity for ICE to grow and further diversify our revenues.  ICE has been a partner with Climate Exchange and Dr. Sandor since 2003, and we have worked together toward the development and expansion of the emissions markets.  The leadership that Climate Exchange has shown in establishing market standards in Europe, and increasingly the U.S. and Asia, has driven its success, and we see continued growth opportunities within these nascent markets globally.
 
Commenting on the Acquisition, Dr. Richard Sandor, Chairman of Climate Exchange, said:
 
The development of our company from initial concept to its leadership role in global environmental markets is a tribute to the vision and efforts of our entire team. We believe that a combination with ICE makes strategic sense and look forward to addressing continued opportunities together. ICE has committed to further developing the Climate Exchange businesses and building on our joint track record of innovation and success to the benefit of our customers across futures and over-the-counter markets in Europe, Asia and the U.S..

For immediate release
 
30 April 2010
 
 
 
of Climate Exchange plc
 
 
The Boards of ICE and Climate Exchange are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a unanimously recommended Acquisition by Bidco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE, of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Climate Exchange.
 
 
It is intended that the Acquisition be implemented by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 152 of the Isle of Man Companies Act.  The Scheme, which will be subject to the conditions and further terms set out in Appendix 1 and which will be further detailed in the Scheme Document, will be made on the following basis:
 
            for each Climate Exchange Share 750 pence in cash
   
   
   
 
The consideration to be received under the Acquisition represents a premium of approximately:
 
 
 
 
Climate Exchange Shares will be acquired by Bidco fully paid and free from all liens, equitable interests, charges, encumbrances, pre-emption rights and other third party interests and rights of any nature whatsoever and together with all rights now or hereafter attaching to them, including the right to receive and retain all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of this announcement.
 
 
7
 
 
 
The Directors of Climate Exchange, who have been so advised by J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Kinmont, consider the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and reasonable. In providing advice to the Directors of Climate Exchange, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Kinmont have taken into account the commercial assessments of the Directors of Climate Exchange.
 
Accordingly, the Directors of Climate Exchange will unanimously recommend that Climate Exchange Shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed to Climate Exchange Shareholders at the Court Meeting and the Climate Exchange EGM.
 
 
Climate Exchange has successfully pursued a strategy to become a world leading exchange for trading emissions and environmental contracts.  In the largest environmental markets in the world, Climate Exchange transacts in a significant proportion of such business.  In Europe, the EU Emission Trading System () is the worlds largest and most developed emissions cap and trade system and Climate Exchange is a market leader in this segment of the derivatives market in which transaction volumes are continuing to rise rapidly with 2010 volumes 15.6 per cent. ahead of 2009 (year to date).  In the US, Climate Exchange has a significant share in all the main emissions contracts currently i n force, including Sulphur Oxide (), Nitrogen Oxide () and the state level Greenhouse Gas () programmes of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative () and California Climate Action Registry ().
EU ETS
SOx
NOx
GHG
RGGI
CCAR
 
The Board believes the future growth of Climate Exchange will be driven by the switch in the EU ETS initial distribution mechanism from central government allocation to 100 per cent. auctioning.  This is expected to generate a material increase in the underlying price risk exposure for industries within EU ETS and, as a consequence, potentially lead to a material increase in demand for hedging products and strategies.  In the US, the key growth drivers are expected to be resolutions on federal level legislative programmes, including a nationwide cap and trade system for GHGs, as well as clarity on the existing SOx and NOx programmes.  In addition, Climate Exchange has interests in other countries where environmental markets are being developed and which may develop to material scale including China in part icular.
 
As Climate Exchanges key products or offerings have expanded and developed, certain aspects of its original strategy have been confirmed and the needs of its customers in the marketplace have been understood.  Climate Exchanges customers have made it clear that they see benefits in a single trading platform for environmental contracts worldwide and for this platform also to provide a wider offering of contracts.  Equally, a single clearing entity for Climate Exchange customers is expected to bring customer benefits in terms of netting, cross margining and ease of use.
 
The offer from ICE, valuing Climate Exchange at 750p per share, represents a premium of 56.9 per cent. to the closing price of 478 pence per Climate Exchange Share on 29 April 2010, the last trading day prior to the date of this announcement.  While the Board is confident that the US will ultimately adopt a mandatory emissions trading system, it accepts that there is uncertainty regarding the timing of the implementation of such legislation.  Similarly there is also an additional level of uncertainty regarding the implementation of an international basis for the post-Kyoto era.  Climate Exchange faces a number of risks alongside the opportunities described above and considers that a larger organisation with a broader portfolio of trading contracts is a more appropriate owner of the business. Against this b ackground, the Directors of Climate Exchange consider the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and reasonable, providing shareholders with certainty and the opportunity to realise, in cash, their investment in Climate Exchange.

The Board and management of ICE believe that the Acquisition of Climate Exchange represents an attractive strategic opportunity to combine two companies with complementary businesses and strengths and to enhance the competitiveness of the respective businesses.  ICE, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, IntercontinentalExchange Holdings, acquired 2,277,034 Climate Exchange Shares (representing approximately 4.8 per cent. of Climate Exchanges entire existing issued share capital) on 22 June 2009 for a price of 645 pence per Climate Exchange Share.  The Board and management of ICE have determined that the Acquisition is consistent with the strategic plans of ICE to expand its product offerings and diversify its class of commodities.  The tran saction is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2011 and slightly dilutive to earnings for the balance of the current year following an anticipated closing at the end of July 2010.

ICE and its affiliates currently have multiple contracts in place with Climate Exchange and its affiliates to provide technology and clearing services, including a cooperation and licensing agreement whereby ICE provides an electronic trading platform and clearing to European Climate Exchange () for European emissions trading, a licensing technology agreement whereby ICE provides an electronic trading platform to Chicago Climate Exchange () for U.S. emissions trading and a clearing services agreement whereby ICE provides clearing for CCXs U.S. emissions trading.  Pursuant to these co ntracts, ICE charges fees to Climate Exchange for the services provided and shares in the revenue generated by Climate Exchange with respect to the trading and clearing of emissions contracts.
ECX
CCX
 
ICE identified a number of factors that it believes support engaging in the Acquisition and would contribute to the success and the future performance of the combined companies, including:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Climate Exchange is a holding company whose subsidiaries are principally engaged in owning, operating and developing exchanges to facilitate trading in environmental financial instruments, including emissions reduction credits in both voluntary and mandatory markets.  Climate Exchange is a leader in the development of traded emissions markets.  Its three core operating businesses are ECX, which operates an exchange that focuses on compliance certificates for the mandatory EU ETS, CCX, which operates the voluntary, but contractually binding cap and trade system for greenhouse gas emissions reductions and the Chicago Climate Futures Exchange (), a regulated exchange in the United States with a portf olio of environmental futures contracts.
CCFE

ICE, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ICE, is a leading operator of regulated global futures exchanges and over-the-counter markets for agricultural, credit, currency, emissions, energy and equity index contracts.  ICE Futures Europe hosts trade in half of the worlds crude and refined oil futures.  ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Futures Canada list agricultural, currencies and Russell Index markets.  ICE is also a leading operator of central clearing services for the futures and over-the-counter markets, with five regulated clearing houses across North America and Europe.  ICE serves customers in more than 55 countries.
 
 
In relation to the cash consideration payable by Bidco under the terms of the Acquisition, $220 million has been drawn from ICEs existing credit facilities and the remainder will be funded from its existing cash resources.
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley, is satisfied that sufficient financial resources are available to Bidco to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable under the terms of the Acquisition.
 
 
The Acquisition will affect share options and incentive awards granted under the Climate Exchange Share Schemes.  An appropriate offer or proposal will be made in due course to participants in the Climate Exchange Share Schemes.  Details of that offer or proposal will be set out in the Scheme Document and in separate letters to be sent to participants in the Climate Exchange Share Schemes.
 
 
The Acquisition will affect warrants issued by members of the Climate Exchange Group.  An appropriate offer or proposal will be made in due course to those warrant holders who have the right to be issued shares in Climate Exchange in connection with the completion of the Acquisition.  Details of that offer or proposal will be set out in the Scheme Document and in separate letters to be sent to such warrant holders.
 
 
Dr. Richard Sandor, the current Chairman of Climate Exchange, has agreed in principle to enter into an employment agreement with ICE, which will become effective upon completion of the Acquisition and under which Dr. Sandor will be appointed as Chairman Emeritus of Climate Initiatives.
 
The combination of two companies with complementary businesses is likely to provide for opportunities to achieve synergies with respect to costs and expenses and, in assessing the terms of the Acquisition, ICE has made certain assumptions in relation to such synergies.  Further details with respect to the effects of the implementation of the Acquisition on employment and the locations of Climate Exchanges places of business will be provided in the Scheme Document.
 
ICE confirms that the existing employment rights, including pension rights, of the management and employees of Climate Exchange will be fully safeguarded.

Climate Exchange and Bidco have entered into an implementation agreement (the ) which provides, inter alia, for the implementation of the Scheme and contains certain assurances and confirmations between the parties, including with respect to the implementation of the Scheme and regarding the conduct of the business of Climate Exchange in the period prior to the Effective Date.  Climate Exchange has also undertaken not to solicit any other potential alternative offers.
Implementation Agreement
 
 
Bidco has received irrevocable undertakings from the Directors of Climate Exchange to vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed to Climate Exchange Shareholders at the Court Meeting and the Climate Exchange EGM in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings, which amount, in aggregate, to 9,026,583 Climate Exchange Shares (representing approximately 19.0 per cent. of Climate Exchanges entire existing issued share capital).
 
Bidco has received a further irrevocable undertaking from Climate Exchanges largest shareholder, Invesco, to vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed to Climate Exchange Shareholders at the Court Meeting and the Climate Exchange EGM in respect of its own beneficial shareholding, which amounts, in aggregate, to 14,160,996 Climate Exchange Shares (representing approximately 29.8 per cent. of Climate Exchanges entire existing issued share capital).
 
Bidco has therefore received irrevocable undertakings with respect to 23,187,579 Climate Exchange Shares (representing approximately 48.7 per cent. of Climate Exchanges entire existing issued share capital).  Together with ICEs holding of 2,277,034 Climate Exchange Shares (representing approximately 4.8 per cent. of Climate Exchanges entire existing issued share capital), this represents approximately 53.5 per cent. of the entire existing issued share capital of Climate Exchange.
 
Further details of these irrevocable undertakings, including the circumstances in which they will fall away, are set out in Appendix 4 and will also be set out in Bidcos Opening Position Disclosure.
 
In the event that Bidco elects to effect the Acquisition by means of an Offer, the undertakings provide that they will apply to acceptances of such Offer.
 
 
ICE confirms that it is on the date of this announcement making an Opening Position Disclosure, which discloses the details required to be disclosed by it under Rule 8.1(a) of the Code.
 
 
Under the Scheme, each Climate Exchange Share will be transferred to Bidco.  In consideration for the transfer of their shares in Climate Exchange, Climate Exchange Shareholders will receive consideration under the terms of the Acquisition as outlined above.  On the Scheme becoming effective, Climate Exchange will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bidco, operating under Climate Exchanges respective brand names.
 
The Acquisition and the Scheme will be subject to the conditions set out in Appendix 1, including the sanction of the Scheme by the Court and satisfaction of certain regulatory conditions.
 
To become effective, the Scheme requires, amongst other things, the approval of a majority in number of Climate Exchange Shareholders present and voting in person or by proxy at the Court Meeting, representing not less than 75 per cent. in value of the Climate Exchange Shares held by such Climate Exchange Shareholders, together with the sanction of the Court.  The Climate Exchange Shares held by ICE will not be voted on any resolution put to Climate Exchange Shareholders to approve or to give effect to the Scheme.
 
 
11
 
 
In addition to the Court Meeting, the Climate Exchange EGM will be convened.  This meeting will be held directly after the Court Meeting.
 
The Scheme will only become effective upon delivery of an office copy of the Court Order to the Financial Supervision Commission for registration.  Upon the Scheme becoming effective, it will be binding on all Climate Exchange Shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the Court Meeting or the Climate Exchange EGM.
 
 
The implications of the Scheme and the Acquisition for persons not resident in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man may be affected by the laws of other relevant jurisdictions.  Any persons who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man should inform themselves about and observe any applicable requirements.  Further details in relation to overseas shareholders will be set out in the Scheme Document.  If you are in any doubt about your position, you should consult your own professional adviser in the relevant territory.
 
 
It is expected that the formal Scheme Document setting out the details of the Acquisition will be posted to Climate Exchange Shareholders and, for information only, to holders of options under the Climate Exchange Share Schemes and holders of warrants no later than 28 May 2010.  It is expected that the Scheme will become effective and the Acquisition completed by the end of July 2010, subject to the satisfaction or (if applicable) waiver of all relevant conditions.
 
The Scheme Document will include full details of the Scheme, together with notices of the Court Meeting and the Climate Exchange EGM and the expected timetable, and will specify the necessary action to be taken by Climate Exchange Shareholders.
 
Prior to (and conditional on) the Scheme becoming effective, Bidco intends to procure that Climate Exchange will make an application for the cancellation of trading of the Climate Exchange Shares on AIM on the Effective Date.

The combination of Climate Exchanges emissions markets and ICEs futures and OTC energy markets is an important and logical strategic combination for our customers and shareholders, and clearly an exciting opportunity for ICE to grow and further diversify our revenues, said ICE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher. ICE has been a partner with Climate Exchange and Dr. Sandor since 2003, and we have worked together toward the development and expansion of the emissions markets. The leadership that Climate Exchange has shown in establishing market standards in Europe, and increasingly the U.S. and Asia, has driven its success, and we see continued growth opportunities within these nascent markets globally.

The development of our Company from initial concept to its leadership role in global environmental markets is a tribute to the vision and efforts of our entire team. We believe that a combination with ICE makes strategic sense and look forward to addressing continued opportunities together, said Climate Exchanges Chairman Richard Sandor. ICE has committed to further developing the Climate Exchange businesses and building on our joint track record of innovation and success to the benefit of our customers across futures and OTC markets in Europe, Asia and the U.S.
