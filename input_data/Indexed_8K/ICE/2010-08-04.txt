ICE announced that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey C. Sprecher, adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan in May 2010 pursuant to guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The pre-arranged plan was adopted by Continental Power Exchange, Inc. (CPEX).  Mr. Sprecher owns 100% of the equity interest in CPEX and CPEX has no operations and no assets other than its equity interest in ICE.  The trading plan will enable Mr. Sprecher to implement certain tax planning measures, diversify his personal investment portfolio, and pay income taxes incurred in connection with equity awards. The sales under this plan represent less than 10% of Mr. Sprechers combined direct and indirect holdings of stock, restricted stock and stock options.
 
Under the ICE Stock Ownership Policy, Mr. Sprecher is required to hold ten times his base salary in ICE securities.  After the sales contemplated in the stock trading plan, Mr. Sprecher will continue to hold approximately 185 times his base salary in ICE securities under the Stock Ownership Policy. The plan was adopted during an authorized trading period. Under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, trades may be executed at times when an officer is in possession of material non-public information provided the trade is executed based on the application of a formula or binding instructions determined at the time the trading plan was arranged and the trading plan was entered into at a time when the officer was not in possession of material non-public information.

Second Quarter 2010 Results
Consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2010 grew 18% to $296 million, compared to $250 million in the second quarter of 2009. Consolidated transaction and clearing revenues increased 19% to $265 million in the second quarter of 2010, from $223 million during the same period in 2009. The increase in transaction and clearing revenue was driven primarily by record trading volume in ICEs Brent and WTI crude futures contracts, record OTC energy volumes and an increase in CDS clearing revenues.
 
Second quarter 2010 transaction and clearing revenues in ICEs consolidated futures segment were a record $130 million, an increase of 23% from $106 million in the same period in 2009. Consolidated average daily volume (ADV) in ICEs futures segment was 1,392,397 contracts, up 36% from the second quarter of 2009 and was driven by double-digit increases at each of ICEs futures exchanges in the second quarter of 2010.
 
Revenues in ICEs global OTC segment grew 15% to $135 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $117 million in the prior second quarter. Average daily commissions (ADC) for ICEs OTC energy business increased 26% to $1.4 million, compared to $1.1 million in the same period of 2009. Cleared contracts accounted for 97% of OTC energy contract volume during the second quarter of 2010. In ICEs credit derivative markets, second quarter transaction, processing and clearing revenues were $43 million, down 3% compared to $45 million in the same period of 2009, as a result of a decline in CDS execution revenues.
 
Consolidated market data revenues were a record $27 million, up 7% from $25 million in the same second quarter of 2009. Consolidated other revenues were $4 million during the second quarter of 2010, compared to $2 million in the year-ago quarter.
 
Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% to $118 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $115 million in the same period of 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to $3 million of additional compensation and benefits expenses associated with headcount increases and non-cash compensation accruals as a result of the companys above-target performance year-to-date in 2010.
 
Second quarter 2010 consolidated operating income increased 32% to $178 million compared to $135 million in the prior second quarter. Operating margin rose to 60%, compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2009, and up from 58% in the first quarter of 2010.
 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 was 34% compared to 39% for the prior second quarter, which was impacted by the charge relating to the impairment of ICEs investment in Indias National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX).
 
First Half 2010 Results
ICEs first half 2010 consolidated revenues grew 20% to $578 million compared to $482 million in the first half of 2009.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release may contain forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements regarding IntercontinentalExchanges business that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. The factors that might affect our performance include, but are not limited to: our business environment; conditions in global financial markets; domestic and international economic conditions; volatility in commodity prices; our ability to identify and effectively pursue acquisitions and strategic alliances and successfully integrate the companies we acquire on a cost-effective basis; changes in domestic and foreign laws, regulations or government policy; increasing competition and consolidation in our industry; our ability to minimize the risks associated with operating multiple clearing houses in multiple jurisdictions; the success of our initiative to clear credit default swaps transactions; the success of our global clearing strategy; technological developments, including clearing developments; the accuracy of our cost estimates and expectations, including, without limitation, those set forth in this press release under Financial and Operating Guidance; our belief that cash flows will be sufficient to service our debt and fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures at least through the end of 2011; our ability to increase the connectivity to our marketplace; maintaining existing market participants and attracting new ones; our ability to develop new products and services; protecting our intellectual property rights; not violating the intellectual property rights of others; potential adverse litigation results; our belief in our electronic platform and disaster recovery system technologies; and our ability to gain access to comparable products and services if our key technology contracts were terminated.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation
 
ICE presents adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ICE as additional information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. ICE strongly recommends that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this press release and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including ICEs consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
 
When viewed in conjunction with ICEs GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, ICE believes these adjusted measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. ICE management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and management decisions made during the reporting period by excluding certain items that the company believes have less significance on, or do not impact, the day-to-day performance of the business. The adjustments for the periods in 2010 related to the exclusion of charges associated with the acquisition of the Climate Exchange, including the currency hedge implemented at the time of the transaction announcement and acquisition transaction costs. The adjustments for the periods in 2009 related to the exclusion of acquisition transaction costs, an impairment charge related to ICEs investment in Indias NCDEX, and various other nonrecurring charges.
 
ICEs internal budgets are based on adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ICE, and the company periodically reports these measures to its Board of Directors. In addition, adjusted net income attributable to ICE is one of the criteria considered in determining performance-based compensation. ICE uses these adjusted measures because they more clearly highlight trends in the business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since they eliminate from the companys results specific financial items that have less bearing on ICEs operating performance.
 
The following table reconciles our net income attributable to ICE to adjusted net income attributable to ICE and calculates adjusted earnings per common share attributable to ICE for the periods presented below.
