On August 26, 2010, IntercontinentalExchange, Inc., a Delaware corporation (ICE) entered into new aggregate $400.0 million three-year senior unsecured term loan facility (the New Term Loan Facility) pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the New Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo), as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A. (BofA), as Syndication Agent, and the lenders named therein. A copy of the New Credit Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the following summary of the New Term Loan Facility is qualified in its entirety thereby.
The New Term Loan Facility consists of a senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million, the full amount of which was borrowed by ICE on August 26, 2010 (the Closing Date). Outstanding principal of the loans under the New Term Loan Facility is payable in equal installments of $30.0 million for the first eight quarters following the Closing Date, and equal installments of $40.0 million for the final four quarters of the three-year amortization period.  The New Term Loan Facility matures on August 26, 2013. Amounts repaid under the New Term Loan Facility may not be reborrowed.
The loans under the New Term Loan Facility shall, at the option of ICE, bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin rate. The base rate will be equal to the higher of (i) Wells Fargos prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.50%. The applicable margin rate ranges from 2.00% to 2.75% on the LIBOR loans and from 1.00% to 1.75% for the base rate loans based on ICEs total leverage ratio calculated on a trailing twelve-month period. Interest is payable quarterly with respect to base rate loans and either monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly with respect to LIBOR loans depending upon the interest period selected by ICE.
The proceeds of the loans under the New Term Loan Facility will be used as follows: (i) to refinance existing $220 million indebtedness of ICE related to the July 8, 2010 acquisition of Climate Exchange plc and outstanding under ICEs aggregate $725.0 million three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facilities established pursuant to a Credit Agreement, dated March 31, 2010, with Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent, BofA, as Syndication Agent, and the lenders named therein (filed as Exhibit 10.1 to ICEs Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that was filed on August 4, 2010, the Existing 2010 Credit Facility); and (ii) to replenish cash following the all-cash acquisition of the Climate Exchange.
 
With limited exceptions, ICE may prepay the outstanding loans under the New Term Loan Facility, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The New Term Loan Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants consistent with ICEs other existing senior credit facilities, including, but not limited to, leverage and interest coverage ratios, as well as limitations or required notices or approvals for acquisitions, dispositions of assets and certain investments in subsidiaries, the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other fundamental changes to ICEs business. ICE is currently in compliance with all applicable covenants under the New Term Loan Facility.
 
 
 
On August 26, 2010, ICE also entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the Amendment to 2010 Credit Facility), amending the Existing 2010 Credit Facility. The Amendment to 2010 Credit Facility amended the Existing 2010 Credit Facility to (i) include a new sublimit of up to $150.0 million for multicurrency swingline loans, under which ICE may make swingline borrowings in either Euros or Sterling, and (ii) make certain other amendments thereto which are primarily technical in nature. A copy of the Amendment to 2010 Credit Facility is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2, and is incorporated herein by reference, and the preceding summary of the Amendment to 2010 Credit Facility is qualified in its entirety thereby.

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each Lender severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

2.13           .
Recovery of Payments
 
(a)           The Borrower agrees that to the extent the Borrower makes a payment or payments to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar state or federal law, common law or equitable cause (whether as a result of any demand, settlement, litigation or otherwise), then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Obligation intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been received.
 
(b)           If any amounts distributed by the Administrative Agent to any Lender are subsequently returned or repaid by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, its representative or successor in interest, or any other Person, whether by court order, by settlement approved by the Lender in question, or pursuant to applicable Requirements of Law, such Lender will, promptly upon receipt of notice thereof from the Administrative Agent, pay the Administrative Agent such amount.  If any such amounts are recovered by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower, its representative or successor in interest or such other Person, the Administrative Agent will redistribute such amounts to the Lenders on the same basis as such amounts were originally distributed.

Pro Rata Treatment
 
(a)           All fundings, continuations and conversions of Loans shall be made by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their respective outstanding Commitments (in the case of the initial funding of the Loans on the Closing Date) or on the basis of their respective outstanding Loans (in the case of continuations and conversions of the Loans), as the case may be from time to time.  All payments on account of principal of or interest on any Loans, fees or any other Obligations owing to or for the account of any one or more Lenders shall be apportioned ratably among such Lenders in proportion to the amounts of such principal, interest, fees or other Obligations owed to them respectively.
 
 
32
 
 
(b)           If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other Obligations hereunder resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such Obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division Investigation of Credit Derivatives Market
 
The Borrower  received a letter dated August 11, 2009 from the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) that included a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) requiring the Borrower to produce certain documents and answer certain interrogatories related to the credit derivatives market.  The Borrower operates businesses in the credit derivatives market in the U.S. through its Creditex division and through the operation of ICE Trust U.S., its U.S. credit default swap (CDS) clearing house and ICE Clear Europe, its European CDS clearing house.  In connection with the acquisition of The Clearing Corporation (TCC) and the concurrent establishment of ICE Trust U.S., the Borrower entered into agreements with the various dealer/owners of TCC regarding the formation and operation of ICE Trust U.S.  The CID seeks information and documents as part of an Antitrust Division industry investigation into violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  The purpose of the CID is to investigate whether there has been or may be a violation of the Sherman Act by conduct, activities, or proposed action of the following nature: agreements restraining competition in credit derivatives trading, processing, clearing, and information services, attempts to monopolize/monopoly maintenance of credit derivative information services.
 
Information and documents requested by the CID are being provided to the DOJ on a rolling basis.

Amirsaleh v. Board of Trade of the City of New York, Inc. and IntercontinentalExchange, Inc.
 
This action was filed by a former NYBOT equity member in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, on March 22, 2007, asserting that NYBOT breached the terms of the Merger Agreement between NYBOT and the Borrower, and breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing implicit in every contract, by allegedly failing to give plaintiff timely notice of the election deadline with respect to the merger consideration that would be paid to NYBOT equity members. The Plaintiff seeks shares of the Borrowers stock in an amount equal to the amount received by any member who made an all stock election, and seeks the issuance to him of two NYBOT trading memberships, which were not issued following the merger due to plaintiffs failure to own and pledge the shares of the Borrowers stock that were a pre-requisite to the issuance of such memberships.
 
The Borrower and NYBOT filed an Answer to the Complaint on April 23, 2007, denying the essential allegations and asserting as affirmative defenses that (1) the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (2) plaintiffs claims and requests for relief are barred by the doctrines of waiver, estoppel and/or acquiescence, (3) plaintiff lacks standing to assert claims for breach of the merger agreement, and (4) failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate the damages claimed. A motion for Judgment on the Pleading or in the alternative, for Summary Judgment was filed by defendants on June 11, 2008 and was decided on September 11, 2008. The court granted the motion insofar as the breach of contract claim was concerned and denied it with respect to the claim based on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because the Court found there to be issues of fact in dispute that precluded the grant of summary judgment as a procedural matter. Following the conclusion of discovery, Plaintiff filed a motion for Summary Judgment that was denied on November 9, 2009. The trial was held on November 16-18, and the Court issued a decision and Order in favor of defendants, dismissing the Complaint with prejudice, on January 19, 2010. Plaintiff appealed the Courts decision to the Supreme Court of Delaware, which has decided to hear oral argument en banc.  The en banc hearing was scheduled for August 25, 2010 but that date has been postponed due to conflicts and a new date has not yet been scheduled.

SEC Inquiry
 
In November 2008, Creditex received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requiring production of data and communications regarding transactions in certain named financial credit default swaps during the period September 1 through September 19, 2008, specifically: a schedule reflecting all CDS transactions brokered by Creditex in the named financial sector CDS during the relevant period, all bids and offers received by Creditex with respect to such financial CDS during the relevant period, and any communications with respect to the foregoing.  Creditex responded to this request on December 19, 2008.  Additionally, in January 2009, Creditex received a verbal request from the SEC to produce all documentation and information given to the New York Attorney General (NYAG) in connection with a prior NYAG investigation.   Creditex responded to this request on February 6, 2009.
 
No further requests have been made by the SEC since January 2009.

Financial and Energy Exchange Limited (FEX)
 
Pursuant to the Clearing Services Agreement (CSA), FEX owes TCC approximately $833,333.00.  TCC issued a notice to FEX terminating the CSA for material breach given FEXs failure to pay invoiced amounts owed.
 
FEX responded that TCCs termination was invalid because FEX is disputing the moneys invoiced by TCC.  FEX alleged that TCC repeatedly failed to perform the services under the CSA.  FEX further alleged that while previous invoices have been paid by FEX with respect to implementation fees, TCC did not earn the implementation fees and that FEX is entitled to recover those moneys or recover damages from TCC for its breaches of the CSA in failing to provide the services in accordance with the CSAs terms.  FEX alleged that among other breaches, TCC has failed to take any steps to progress its application for a Clearing and Settlement Facility Licensefrom the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.  FEX invited TCC to withdraw its termination and asked TCC to confirm such, in writing, by May 11, 2009. FEX cited the non-compete provision of the CSA and has asked TCC to confirm, in writing, that it is not providing competing clearing services within Australia or New Zealand to ICE Trust or its affiliates.  FEX raised a concern that following TCCs acquisition by ICE, TCC may have acted, or is continuing to act, in breach of the confidentiality provisions of the CSA.  FEX reserved its right to apply to the Supreme Court of South Wales for relief including declarations that TCC is not entitled to terminate the CSA; damages for TCCs wrongful repudiation; injunctions to prevent TCC from acting in breach the non-compete provision of the CSA; and damages for any breach of the confidentiality provisions.
 
 
TCC responded to FEX and denied FEXs allegations that TCC is in breach of the CSA.  TCC also referenced the numerous occasions when FEX had indicated, in writing, that it was not disputing amounts owed and that its delay in paying the outstanding invoices was merely the results of funding issues.  TCC also challenged FEXs assertion of its right to seek relief before the Supreme Court of New South Wales and TCC wrote that the appropriate jurisdiction for any dispute would be a court in Chicago, Illinois.
 
On August 18, 2009, FEX wrote that it is of the view that, when TCC issued invoices to FEX, FEX was entitled to dispute those invoices on the basis that TCC had failed to perform its obligations under the Agreement. In its letter, FEXalleges that TCC has wrongfully repudiated the Agreement and that FEX is entitled to recover damages from TCC to compensate FEX for:
 
 
 
FEX also maintains that TCC made representations as to TCCs status as an independent clearing house and that subsequent events demonstrate that TCC is not an independent clearing house.
 
 
13
 
 
FEX indicated that it also will consider an action for contravention by TCC of section 52 of the TRADE Practices Act as an alternative to the action for damages discussed herein.  FEX considers that it would be entitled to recover from TCC a similar quantum of damages on the basis of this cause of action as would be recoverable on a cause of action against TCC for breach of the Agreement (AUD$14,514,680).
 
On or about August 31, 2009, TCC filed a Complaint against FEX in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division seeking damages and declaratory relief.  Specifically, TCCs Complaint seeks to recover $833,313 in fees due from FEX and a declaratory judgment that the CSA was properly terminated and that the non-compete provision contained in the CSA does not survive the CSAs termination.  On November 6, 2009, FEX filed a Motion to Dismiss TCCs Complaint.  FEX contends that the United States District Court lacks personal jurisdiction over FEX.
 
On January 8, 2010, TCC filed its Response in Opposition to FEXs Motion to Dismiss TCCs Complaint.  On January 29, 2010, FEX filed its Reply in Support of its Motion to Dismiss The Clearing Corporations Complaint.
 
On February 18, 2010, the judge ruled in favor of TCC, and denied Defendant FEXs Motion to Dismiss.  On March 17, 2010, FEX filed an answer to TCCs complaint and a counterclaim against TCC alleging fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act.  FEX is claiming approximately $2,010,000.00 in compensatory damages and unspecified amount of punitive damages and legal fees.  TCC is disputing the claim and denies any liability.
 
On April 7, 2010, TCC filed its Motion to Dismiss Counts I (fraudulent misrepresentation) and IV (Illinois Consumer Fraud Act) of the FEX Counterclaim.  On May 13, 2010, FEX filed its Response to the TCC Motion to Dismiss Counts I and IV of FEXs Counterclaim.  On June 10, 2010, TCC filed its Reply in Further Support of its Motion to Dismiss Counts I and IV of FEXs Counterclaim. On July 16, 2010, Judge Zagel denied TCCs motion to dismiss Counts I and IV.
 
TCC has until August 27, 2010 to file its answer to the FEX Counterclaim and a status date of September 30, 2010 has been scheduled.
 
Trading Privilege Holder Correspondence
 
Chicago Climate Futures Exchange LLC (CCFE) received a letter dated June 21, 2010 from Mr. Richard Barnett on behalf of Greenscene, LLC (Greenscene), a CCFE Trading Privilege Holder (TPH), regarding the acquisition by IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (ICE) of Climate Exchange plc (CLE) (ultimate parent company of CCFE).  Greenscene states in its letter that it is disappointed in the handling of TPHs in the acquisition  and requests further information on how ICE intends to compensate TPHs for their contributed capital to CCFE.  In brief, Greenscene argues that TPHs are capital providers to CCFE and are in a similar position to public equity investors in CLE  and should be compensated in the acquisition similar to CLE equity investors. Greenscenes letter lists 32 other TPHs that purportedly have read and agree with the spirit and content of the letter.  Greenscene also filed a complaint with The Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the Panel) and requested that the Panel not approve the acquisition of CLE by ICE.  It is CLEs position that CCFE TPHs have no equity rights in relation to CLE and, therefore, TPHs are not in a similar position to public equity investors in CLE.
 
 
14
 
 
In addition to the Greenscene letter, CCFE has been contacted by other TPHs requesting information regarding the impact of the acquisition on TPHs.  The Panel agreed with CLEs position that TPHs do not have an equity position in CLE and, as a result, the Panel elected not to pursue Greenscenes complaint.  The acquisition of CLE by ICE was approved by the High Court of the Isle of Man on July 7, 2010.

Transactions with Officer and Stockholder of ICE
 
As a part of the transactions surrounding our formation, ICE entered into an agreement with ICEs predecessor company, Continental Power Exchange, Inc. (), on May 11, 2000. ICEs Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sprecher, owns all the equity interests in CPEX.  Pursuant to the agreement, CPEX conveyed all of its assets and liabilities to ICE.  These assets included intellectual property that ICE used to develop its electronic platform.  In return, ICE issued to CPEX an equity interest in ICE and, further, agreed to give CPEX a put option, by which CPEX could require ICE to buy its equity interest in ICE at the purchase price equal to either its fair market value or $5 million, whichever is greater.
CPEX
 
In connection with ICEs initial public offering, in October 2005, ICE entered an agreement with CPEX and Mr. Sprecher to terminate the put option upon the closing of ICEs initial public offering.  In connection with the termination of the put option, ICE amended certain registration rights previously granted to CPEX, which currently owns 1,952,978 shares of ICEs common stock.  Under this agreement, CPEX is entitled to require ICE to register for resale into the public market its common stock if Mr. Sprechers employment has been terminated.  In addition, ICE may be obligated to pay the expenses of registration of such shares, including underwriters discounts up to a maximum of $4.5 million.
