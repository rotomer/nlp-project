For the fourth quarters ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, certain items were included in ICEs operating results that management believes are not indicative of normal operating performance.  Excluding these items from fourth quarter results, fourth quarter 2010 net income attributable to ICE increased 19% to $100 million. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 21% to $1.35 in the fourth quarter of 2010.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, ICE reported consolidated revenues of $1.15 billion, the seventh consecutive year of record revenues and an increase of 16% from $995 million in 2009. Consolidated 2010 net income attributable to ICE grew 26% to a record $398 million, from $316 million in 2009, and diluted EPS increased 25% to $5.35 from $4.27. Consolidated cash flow from operations grew 10% from the prior year to a record $534 million in 2010.
As part of our commitment to our customers and shareholders, ICE consistently leads in terms of execution on new opportunities and growth despite an uncertain economic and regulatory environment, said ICE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher. We are serving the rising demands for risk management in global commodities and derivatives with our transparent markets and global clearing houses. With products that are globally relevant such as our flagship Brent crude and gasoil futures contracts, we are addressing risk management requirements and we will continue to bring innovation, growth and security to our customers and markets.
 
 
 
 
Scott Hill, ICE SVP and CFO, said: Once again in 2010, we delivered record revenues and earnings. The strength in our commodities business continues into 2011, and we continue to expand our trading, clearing and processing services for market participants world-wide. Our spending discipline, solid balance sheet and strong cash flow allow ICE to continue to invest in an expanded range of services for our customers, while delivering sector-leading growth and returns on capital.
Fourth Quarter 2010 Results
Consolidated revenues grew 11% to $285 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, from $257 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Quarterly consolidated transaction and clearing fee revenues increased 10% to $251 million, compared to $229 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The growth in transaction and clearing fee revenues was driven primarily by strong trading volume in ICEs futures segment, new products and growth in the credit default swaps (CDS) clearing business.
 
Transaction and clearing fee revenues in ICEs futures segment totaled $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 24% from $102 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Consolidated average daily volume in ICEs futures segment in the fourth quarter was 1,265,388 contracts, up 21% compared to the same period of 2009.
 
Transaction and clearing fee revenues in ICEs global OTC segment were $125 million in the quarter, compared to $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Average daily commissions (ADC) for ICEs OTC energy business in the fourth quarter were $1.33 million, flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Cleared contracts accounted for 96% of OTC energy contract volume during the fourth quarter of 2010. In ICEs credit derivatives business, fourth quarter revenues totaled $38 million, comprised of $22 million from Creditex and $15 million from CDS clearing.
 
Consolidated market data revenues were a record $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 10% from $25 million in the year-ago quarter. Consolidated other revenues were $6 million, compared to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Consolidated operating expenses declined 5% to $126 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $133 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. This decrease is primarily attributable to a $12 million decline in compensation and benefits expenses, offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of additional amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the Climate Exchange plc (CLE) expenses following its acquisition in July 2010, and additional technology hosting and hardware and software support expenses resulting from the growth of our business.
Consolidated operating income in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 28% to $159 million, compared to $124 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating margin was 56%, compared to 48% in the prior fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32%, compared to 36% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
Full-Year 2010 Results
For the year ended December 31, 2010, consolidated revenues were $1.15 billion, an increase of 16% from $995 million in 2009. Consolidated transaction and clearing revenues grew 16% to $1.02 billion from $884 million in 2009. The growth in transaction and clearing revenues was driven primarily by higher trading volume in the ICE Brent crude and ICE Gasoil futures contracts, by OTC energy commissions, and by an increase in CDS clearing revenues, which offset a decline in CDS execution revenues.
 
Transaction and clearing fee revenues in ICEs futures segment totaled $504 million in 2010, up 23% from $410 million in 2009. Volume in ICEs futures segment grew 25% from 2009, reaching a record 329 million contracts. ADV in 2010 grew 26% to 1,305,553 contracts. ICE Futures Europe and ICE Futures U.S. established their 13th and eighth consecutive annual volume records, respectively.
Transaction and clearing fee revenues in ICEs global OTC segment grew 10% in 2010, to $520 million, compared to $475 million in 2009. ADC for ICEs OTC energy business were a record $1.37 million in 2010, an increase of 14% from 2009 ADC of $1.20 million, and marked the seventh consecutive year of record ADC. Cleared contracts accounted for 95% of OTC energy contract volume throughout 2010, compared to 94% during 2009. Revenues from ICEs CDS execution and clearing businesses totaled $166 million in 2010, comprised of $106 million from Creditex and $60 million from global CDS clearing. Through February 4, 2011, ICEs CDS clearing houses have cleared $15.4 trillion in gross notional value, including $10 trillion cleared during 2010.
 
Consolidated market data revenues during 2010 grew 7% to $109 million, from $102 million in 2009.
Consolidated operating expenses increased 3% in 2010 to $498 million, compared to $482 million in 2009. The increase primarily resulted from a $10 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, and a $4 million increase in acquisition-related transaction costs.
Consolidated operating income for 2010 increased 27% to $652 million, compared to $513 million in 2009. Operating margin was 57% for the year ended December 31, 2010, up from 52% in 2009.
The effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 33% and 36%, respectively.
Consolidated cash flow from operations was $534 million, up 10% from $487 million in 2009. Capital expenditures for 2010 were $22 million, compared to $24 million in 2009. Capitalized software development costs totaled $26 million for the full year, compared to $20 million in 2009. Capital expenditures primarily related to hardware purchases required for development and expansion of our electronic platforms, hosting and clearing houses.
Unrestricted cash and short-term investments were $624 million as of December 31, 2010. At the end of 2010, ICE had $579 million in outstanding debt.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation
Below we provide adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ICE as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below do not reflect historical operating performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe these adjusted measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. Our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and management decisions made during the reporting period by excluding certain items that we believe have less significance on, or do not impact, the day-to-day performance of our business. We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, to assess operating performance. We use adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted earnings per share because they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our operating performance.
Adjusted net income attributable to ICE for the periods presented below is calculated by adding net income attributable to ICE and various charges that are not routine operating expenses and gains, and their related income tax effects. We do not believe these items are representative of our future operating performance since these charges and gains were not consistent with our historical and normal operating performance.
The following table reconciles net income attributable to ICE to adjusted net income attributable to ICE and calculates adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below. Adjusted earnings per share is calculated as adjusted net income attributable to ICE divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding.
 
 
During the year and three months ended December 31, 2010, we recognized costs associated with our acquisition of the Climate Exchange plc (CLE), including the currency hedge purchased at the time of the transaction announcement, a net gain on the sale of our CLE investment, acquisition-related transaction costs and acquisition-related employee severance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized impairment losses related to our investment in the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange of India (NCDEX). During the year and three months ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a gain on the sale of our LCH.Clearnet cost method investment, wrote off two other cost method investments, recognized various state and sales tax liabilities and also recognized severance costs throughout the year related to The Clearing Corporation (TCC) acquisition. During the first three quarters of 2009, we also recognized acquisition-related transaction costs relating to the TCC acquisition and costs relating to a lease termination and fixed asset disposals. The tax effects of these items were calculated by applying specific legal entity and jurisdictional marginal tax rates.
