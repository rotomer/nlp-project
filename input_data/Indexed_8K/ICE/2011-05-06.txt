Item 8.01 Other Events.
IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE, or the "Company"), a leading operator of regulated global exchanges, clearing houses and over-the-counter (OTC) markets, today announced that it has repurchased shares of its common stock pursuant to its previously authorized stock repurchase program, which has a remaining authorization of $209.6 million, as the Company believes that the current share price undervalues ICE. The Company may continue to repurchase shares of its common stock, the timing and extent of which will depend upon market conditions, its stock price and its strategic plans. The Company will suspend future share repurchases under this program, as required by law, prior to disseminating an offer to purchase/prospectus to the security holders of NYSE Euronext in connection with the joint proposal by ICE and NASDAQ OMX to commence an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of NYSE Euronext. The Company undertakes no duty to update this Current Report.
