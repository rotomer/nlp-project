(July 14, 2011)  IntercontinentalExchange (NYSE: ICE), a leading operator of global regulated futures exchanges, clearing houses and over-the-counter (OTC) markets, today announced that it will acquire 12.4% of the shares in Cetip, S.A. (BOVESPA: CTIP3). Cetip is a publicly traded company and is Brazils largest clearing house, as well as the leading operator of registration and custodial services for securities, fixed-income bonds and OTC derivatives.
ATLANTA, GA 
 
Under the terms of the agreement, ICE will acquire 31.6 million shares of Cetip common stock for approximately $512 million in cash, or R$25.50 per Cetip common share, in line with the weighted average closing price over the last 90 days. The transaction consideration includes $302 million from ICEs cash on hand and $210 million drawn from ICEs credit facilities. The transaction is expected to close on July 15, 2011. Upon the completion of the transaction, ICE will be the single largest shareholder in Cetip. ICEs investment will be reflected on its balance sheet as a cost method investment. The transaction will not materially impact ICEs 2011 earnings.
 
Subject to a vote at the next general shareholders meeting, ICE intends to appoint a representative to Cetips Board of Directors.  Advent International, which invested in Cetip prior to the companys initial public offering, was the main selling shareholder and will transition off of the Board.
 
Said ICE Chairman and CEO, Jeffrey C. Sprecher: We are pleased to make this investment in a growth-oriented leader like Cetip, which extends our work in clearing and in the financial and commodity markets in Brazil.  ICE Futures U.S. has long been relied upon by the Brazilian agricultural market participants for our benchmark sugar, coffee and cotton futures. Earlier this year, ICEs energy futures screens were approved for distribution in Brazil, enabling access to our benchmark Brent crude contract.  And, later this month our Brazilian energy exchange partnership known as BRIX will commence operations.  We are committed to contributing to the growth of these markets while supporting increased transparency and security.
 
 
 
 
 
Edgar Ramos, Chairman of Cetip added: We know ICE is a global exchange operator and we are confident that they can help Cetip continue to drive innovation and support the robust development of the Brazilian capital markets.
 
Cetip offers registration, custody, trading and settlement to 15,648 customers, including banks, brokerage houses, securities dealers, leasing companies, insurance companies, investment funds and pension funds. It is Brazils market leader in private fixed-income and OTC derivatives, with more than R$3.0 trillion (~US$1.9 trillion) in assets under custody. More information can be found at .
