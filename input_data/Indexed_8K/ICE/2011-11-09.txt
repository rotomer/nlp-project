The New Credit Facilities consist of (i) an aggregate $500.0 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility to ICE (the )  and (ii) an aggregate $2.1 billion five-year senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility to ICE and ICE Europe (the ). On the Closing Date, $487.5 million of the Term Loan Facility was borrowed by ICE for the repayment of outstanding obligations under the Terminating Credit Facilities, to replenish cash used in the investment in Cetip S.A. and for general corporate purposes, and no amounts were borrowed under the Revolving Facility. The New Credit Facilities mature on November 9, 2016.

Outstanding principal of the loans under the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal installments of $12.5 million on the last day of each fiscal quarter for eleven consecutive fiscal quarters commencing March 31, 2012, and equal installments of $18.75 million on the last day of the next following eight fiscal quarters, with a final principal payment of $200 million due on the maturity date.
 
Under the Revolving Facility, ICE or ICE Europe (with certain limitations), at their option, may borrow, repay and reborrow up to $1.6275 billion of such amount in either U.S. dollars, Euros, U.K. sterling, Canadian dollars or Japanese yen, with the remaining $472.5 million available to be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed by ICE in U.S. dollars only. Standby letters of credit may be issued under the Revolving Facility, and the Revolving Facility includes $150.0 million sublimits for dollar swingline loans and multicurrency swingline loans, respectively. The obligations of ICE Europe under the Revolving Facility are guaranteed by ICE.
 
Each loan under the New Credit Facilities will, at the option of ICE or ICE Europe, as the case may be, bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a base rate plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate. The base rate equals the higher of (i) Wells Fargos prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The applicable margin rate ranges from 1.25% to 2.25% on the LIBOR loans and from 0.25% to 1.25% for the base rate loans based on ICEs total leverage ratio calculated on a trailing twelve-month period. Interest on each outstanding borrowing is payable on the last business day of each calendar quarter with respect to base rate loans and either monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly with respect to LIBOR loans depending upon the interest period selected by ICE or ICE Europe, as the case may be.  With limited exceptions, ICE and ICE Europe may prepay the outstanding loans under the New Credit Facilities, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.

The $203 million borrowed on October 31, 2011 to provide liquidity for three of ICEs clearing houses in preparation for the management of the insolvency of MF Global Holdings Ltd and certain of its subsidiaries has been repaid in full and the full Revolving Facility under the New Credit Facility is available.

(b)           If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other Obligations hereunder resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such Obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans, Swingline Loans or Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to a Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this shall apply).  Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.  If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

On April 28, 2011, ICE Clear Europe received notice from the European Commission (the ) that the Commission has initiated proceedings to investigate a possible competition law infringement by ICE Clear Europe and nine dealer banks (the ) with respect to ICE Clear Europes provision of credit default swap () clearing services.  Specifically, the Commission is investigating (i) whether the fee and profit sharing arrangements between ICE Clear Europe and the Founding Members in connection with the purchase by the Parent Borrower of The Clearing Corporation from the Founding Members in 2009 create an improper incentive for the Founding Members to only use ICE Clear Europe for clearing CDS transactions and (ii) whether the discount arrangement used by ICE Clear Europe is an abuse of dominant position by giving an unfair advantage to the Founding Members and discriminating against other CDS dealers.  These arrangements were put in place in connection with ICE Clear Europes launch of CDS clearing in the midst of the financial crisis and the profit sharing arrangements were part of the consideration the parent Borrower paid to the Founding Members and other owners of The Clearing Corporation in connection with the Parent Borrowers purchase of The Clearing Corporation.  The Clearing Corporation assets and operations were and are used by the Parent Borrower to facilitate backend clearing of CDS transactions in the United States.  ICE Clear Europe has voluntarily furnished information to the Commission as part of an initial assessment that began in October 2009.  Prior to the notice on April 28, 2011, ICE Clear Europe had no contact from the Commission with respect to this matter since January 2010.

ICE Clear Europe intends to cooperate with the Commissions investigation.  Before the Commission reaches an infringement decision, if any, the Commission is required to issue a formal Statement of Objections detailing the specific alleged infringement and supporting evidence and must provide ICE Clear Europe the opportunity to rebut any allegations of wrongdoing.  If the Commission then makes an infringement finding, ICE Clear Europe may be subject to a cease and desist order in respect of the fee and profit sharing arrangements and/or fines.  However, it is too early in the proceedings to determine whether a finding of infringement will be made or the likely range of penalties, if any, if such finding is made by the Commission.  The initiation of proceedings to investigate does not mean that the Commission has made a definitive finding of an infringement of competition law.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Parent Borrower received a letter dated August 11, 2009 from the U.S. Department of Justice (the ) that included a Civil Investigative Demand () requiring the Borrower to produce certain documents and answer certain interrogatories related to the credit derivatives market.  The Parent Borrower operates businesses in the credit derivatives market in the U.S. through its Creditex division and through the operation of ICE Trust U.S., its U.S. credit default swap () clearing house and ICE Clear Europe, its European CDS clearing house.  In connection with the acquisition of The Clearing Corporation () and the concurrent establishment of ICE Trust U.S., the Parent Borrower entered into agreements with the various dealer/owners of TCC regarding the formation and operation of ICE Trust U.S.  The CID seeks information and documents as part of an Antitrust Division industry investigation into violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  The purpose of the CID is to investigate whether there has been or may be a violation of the Sherman Act by conduct, activities, or proposed action of the following nature: agreements restraining competition in credit derivatives trading, processing, clearing, and information services, attempts to monopolize/monopoly maintenance of credit derivative information services.

Alleged phishing and hacking incidents have resulted in unauthorized transfers of certain affected European Union emissions allowances, or EUAs, from accounts in various European registries.  The affected EUAs have been transferred between registry accounts and eventually some affected EUAs were delivered by clearing members to the clearing houses registered accounts in the U.K. pursuant to delivery obligations under relevant ICE Futures Europe contracts. Further, some affected EUAs were delivered to ICE Clear Europe Limiteds () registered accounts in the U.K. as collateral.  In addition, ICE Futures Europe suspended trading in its daily emissions futures markets on January 19, 2011 and such suspension is still in effect.  While this suspension has not extended beyond the daily market, it could eventually apply to our futures emission contracts that settle on a quarterly basis.  We are also aware of litigation between some market participants and it is possible that we could be enjoined in such litigation in the future.  ICE Clear Europe believes, consistent with legal advice received, that it has acquired good title to any Affected Allowances delivered to the Clearing House through the delivery process.

As a part of the transactions surrounding our formation, ICE entered into an agreement with ICEs predecessor company, Continental Power Exchange, Inc. (), on May 11, 2000. ICEs Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sprecher, owns all the equity interests in CPEX.  Pursuant to the agreement, CPEX conveyed all of its assets and liabilities to ICE.  These assets included intellectual property that ICE used to develop its electronic platform.  In return, ICE issued to CPEX an equity interest in ICE and, further, agreed to give CPEX a put option, by which CPEX could require ICE to buy its equity interest in ICE at the purchase price equal to either its fair market value or $5 million, whichever is greater.
CPEX
 
In connection with ICEs initial public offering, in October 2005, ICE entered an agreement with CPEX and Mr. Sprecher to terminate the put option upon the closing of ICEs initial public offering.  In connection with the termination of the put option, ICE amended certain registration rights previously granted to CPEX, which currently owns 1,265,341 shares of ICEs common stock.  Under this agreement, CPEX is entitled to require ICE to register for resale into the public market its common stock if Mr. Sprechers employment has been terminated.  In addition, ICE may be obligated to pay the expenses of registration of such shares, including underwriters discounts up to a maximum of $4.5 million.

On April 28, 2011, ICE Clear Europe received notice from the European Commission (the ) that the Commission has initiated proceedings to investigate a possible competition law infringement by ICE Clear Europe and nine dealer banks (the ) with respect to ICE Clear Europes provision of credit default swap () clearing services.  Specifically, the Commission is investigating (i) whether the fee and profit sharing arrangements between ICE Clear Europe and the Founding Members in connection with the purchase by the Company of The Clearing Corporation from the Founding Members in 2009 create an improper incentive for the Founding Members to only use ICE Clear Europe for clearing CDS transactions and (ii) whether the discount arrangement used by ICE Clear Europe is an abuse of dominant position by giving an unfair advantage to the Founding Members and discriminating against other CDS dealers.  These arrangements were put in place in connection with ICE Clear Europes launch of CDS clearing in the midst of the financial crisis and the profit sharing arrangements were part of the consideration the Company paid to the Founding Members and other owners of The Clearing Corporation in connection with the Companys purchase of The Clearing Corporation.  The Clearing Corporation assets and operations were and are used by the Company to facilitate backend clearing of CDS transactions in the United States.  ICE Clear Europe has voluntarily furnished information to the Commission as part of an initial assessment that began in October 2009.  Prior to the notice on April 28, 2011, ICE Clear Europe had no contact from the Commission with respect to this matter since January 2010.

ICE Clear Europe intends to cooperate with the Commissions investigation.  Before the Commission reaches an infringement decision, if any, the Commission is required to issue a formal Statement of Objections detailing the specific alleged infringement and supporting evidence and must provide ICE Clear Europe the opportunity to rebut any allegations of wrongdoing.  If the Commission then makes an infringement finding, ICE Clear Europe may be subject to a cease and desist order in respect of the fee and profit sharing arrangements and/or fines.  However, it is too early in the proceedings to determine whether a finding of infringement will be made or the likely range of penalties, if any, if such finding is made by the Commission.  The initiation of proceedings to investigate does not mean that the Commission has made a definitive finding of an infringement of competition law.
 
 
The Company received a letter dated August 11, 2009 from the U.S. Department of Justice (the ) that included a Civil Investigative Demand () requiring the Company to produce certain documents and answer certain interrogatories related to the credit derivatives market.  The Company operates businesses in the credit derivatives market in the U.S. through its Creditex division and through the operation of ICE Trust U.S., its U.S. credit default swap () clearing house and ICE Clear Europe, its European CDS clearing house.  In connection with the acquisition of The Clearing Corporation () and the concurrent establishment of ICE Trust U.S., the Company entered into agreements with the various dealer/owners of TCC regarding the formation and operation of ICE Trust U.S.  The CID seeks information and documents as part of an Antitrust Division industry investigation into violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  The purpose of the CID is to investigate whether there has been or may be a violation of the Sherman Act by conduct, activities, or proposed action of the following nature: agreements restraining competition in credit derivatives trading, processing, clearing, and information services, attempts to monopolize/monopoly maintenance of credit derivative information services.

3.      Unauthorized Transfer of Certain European Union Emissions Allowances
 
Alleged phishing and hacking incidents have resulted in unauthorized transfers of certain affected European Union emissions allowances, or EUAs, from accounts in various European registries.  The affected EUAs have been transferred between registry accounts and eventually some affected EUAs were delivered by clearing members to the clearing houses registered accounts in the U.K. pursuant to delivery obligations under relevant ICE Futures Europe contracts. Further, some affected EUAs were delivered to ICE Clear Europe Limiteds () registered accounts in the U.K. as collateral.  In addition, ICE Futures Europe suspended trading in its daily emissions futures markets on January 19, 2011 and such suspension is still in effect.  While this suspension has not extended beyond the daily market, it could eventually apply to our futures emission contracts that settle on a quarterly basis.  We are also aware of litigation between some market participants and it is possible that we could be enjoined in such litigation in the future.  ICE Clear Europe believes, consistent with legal advice received, that it has acquired good title to any Affected Allowances delivered to the Clearing House through the delivery process.
