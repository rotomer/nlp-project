Item 5.02          Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On February 24, 2012, IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (the Company) entered into revised employment agreements for Jeffrey C. Sprecher, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Vice, President and Chief Operating Officer, Scott A. Hill, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David S. Goone, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategic Officer and Edwin Marcial, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, as well as revised employment agreements for each of the Companys other U.S. executive officers (collectively, the Employment Agreements).  The terms of each Employment Agreement are substantially similar, other than the employment term (and corresponding cash severance multiple) that applies to each executive (three years for each of Messrs. Sprecher, Vice, Goone, and Hill, two years for Messrs. Marcial, and either one or two years for each other U.S. executive officer).
 
Among other modifications, the revisions removed the Internal Revenue Code Section 280G excise tax gross-up provision from the Employment Agreements for each executive other than Mr. Hill (whose Employment Agreement had previously been amended to remove this provision).  In addition, the Employment Agreements were modified to (1) change the calculation for the bonus portion of each executives cash severance amount from a fixed percentage of base salary to a formula based on the executives actual bonus payments and (2) clarify treatment of the executives equity awards, in each case, as paid or provided in connection with termination of employment by the Company other than for cause or the executives resignation for good reason (each as defined in the Employment Agreements).  The Company also revised the Employment Agreements to provide that each executive is eligible for change in control severance treatment for a qualifying employment termination during the one hundred eight (180) days (compared to ninety (90) days as previously provided) preceding a change in control, and modified the  good reason definition to include the failure of the Companys successor to assume the executives Employment Agreement and the executives receipt of a notice of non-renewal of the Employment Agreement term during the three years following a change in control.
 
The Company also made certain other modifications to the Employment Agreements to reflect changes that have occurred in the Companys business since the Employment Agreements were last amended.  These changes include, but are not limited to, updates to each executives base salary as reflected in the Employment Agreements and technical changes to each executives non-compete covenant and mandatory arbitration provision.
 
The descriptions of the Employment Agreement modifications as set forth above are not complete and are qualified in all respects by reference to the Employments Agreements.  Copies of the Employment Agreements are attached as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.6 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
